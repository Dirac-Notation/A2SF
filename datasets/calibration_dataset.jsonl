And people.\n\nThe people paid no attention to their insignificance. They built ships\nwhich went through emptiness beyond imagining, and they landed upon\nplanets and rebuilt them to their own liking. Suns flamed terribly,\nrenting their impertinence, and storms swept across the planets\nthey preÃ«mpted, but the people built more strongly and were secure.\nEverything in the universe was bigger or stronger than the people,\nbut they ignored the fact. They went about the businesses they had\ncontrived for themselves.\n\nThey were not afraid of anything until somewhere on a certain small\nplanet an infinitesimal single molecule changed itself.\n\nIt was one molecule among unthinkably many, upon one planet of one\nsolar system among uncountable star clusters. It was not exactly alive,\nbut it acted as if it were, in which it was like all the important\nmatter of the cosmos. It was actually a combination of two complicated\nsubstances not too firmly joined together. When one of the parts\nchanged, it became a new molecule. But, like the original one, it was\nstill capable of a process called autocatalysis. It practiced that\nprocess and catalyzed other molecules into existence, which in each\ncase were duplicates of itself. Then mankind had to take notice, though\nit ignored flaming suns and monstrous storms and emptiness past belief.\n\nMen called the new molecule a virus and gave it a name. They called it\nand its duplicates \"chlorophage.\" And chlorophage was, to people, the\nmost terrifying thing in the universe.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a strictly temporary orbit around the planet Altaira, the _Star\nQueen_ floated, while lift-ships brought passengers and cargo up to\nit. The ship was too large to be landed economically at an unimportant\nspaceport like Altaira. It was a very modern ship and it made the\nRegulus-to-Cassim run, which is five hundred light-years, in only fifty\ndays of Earthtime.\n\nNow the lift-ships were busy. There was an unusual number of passengers\nto board the _Star Queen_ at Altaira and an unusual number of them were\nwomen and children. The children tended to pudginess and the women had\nthe dieted look of the wives of well-to-do men. Most of them looked\nred-eyed, as if they had been crying.\n\nOne by one the lift-ships hooked onto the airlock of the _Star Queen_\nand delivered passengers and cargo to the ship. Presently the last of\nthem was hooked on, and the last batch of passengers came through to\nthe liner, and the ship's doctor watched them stream past him.\n\nHis air was negligent, but he was actually impatient. Like most\ndoctors, Nordenfeld approved of lean children and wiry women. They had\nfewer things wrong with them and they responded better to treatment.\nWell, he was the doctor of the _Star Queen_ and he had much authority.\nHe'd exerted it back on Regulus to insist that a shipment of botanical\nspecimens for Cassim travel in quarantine--to be exact, in the ship's\npractically unused hospital compartment--and he was prepared to\nexercise authority over the passengers.\n\nHe had a sheaf of health slips from the examiners on the ground below.\nThere was one slip for each passenger. It certified that so-and-so had\nbeen examined and could safely be admitted to the _Star Queen's_ air,\nher four restaurants, her two swimming pools, her recreation areas and\nthe six levels of passenger cabins the ship contained.\n\nHe impatiently watched the people go by. Health slips or no health\nslips, he looked them over. A characteristic gait or a typical\ncomplexion tint, or even a certain lack of hair luster, could tell him\nthings that ground physicians might miss. In such a case the passenger\nwould go back down again. It was not desirable to have deaths on a\nliner in space. Of course nobody was ever refused passage because of\nchlorophage. If it were ever discovered, the discovery would already be\ntoo late. But the health regulations for space travel were very, very\nstrict.\n\nHe looked twice at a young woman as she passed. Despite applied\ncomplexion, there was a trace of waxiness in her skin. Nordenfeld had\nnever actually seen a case of chlorophage. No doctor alive ever had.\nThe best authorities were those who'd been in Patrol ships during the\nquarantine of Kamerun when chlorophage was loose on that planet. They'd\nseen beamed-up pictures of patients, but not patients themselves. The\nPatrol ships stayed in orbit while the planet died. Most doctors, and\nNordenfeld was among them, had only seen pictures of the screens which\nshowed the patients.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked sharply at the young woman. Then he glanced at her hands.\nThey were normal. The young woman went on, unaware that for the\nfraction of an instant there had been the possibility of the landing of\nthe _Star Queen_ on Altaira, and the destruction of her space drive,\nand the establishment of a quarantine which, if justified, would mean\nthat nobody could ever leave Altaira again, but must wait there to die.\nWhich would not be a long wait.\n\nA fat man puffed past. The gravity on Altaira was some five per cent\nunder ship-normal and he felt the difference at once. But the veins at\nhis temples were ungorged. Nordenfeld let him go by.\n\nThere appeared a white-haired, space-tanned man with a briefcase under\nhis arm. He saw Nordenfeld and lifted a hand in greeting. The doctor\nknew him. He stepped aside from the passengers and stood there. His\nname was Jensen, and he represented a fund which invested the surplus\nmoney of insurance companies. He traveled a great deal to check on the\nbusiness interests of that organization.\n\nThe doctor grunted, \"What're you doing here? I thought you'd be on the\nfar side of the cluster.\"\n\n\"Oh, I get about,\" said Jensen. His manner was not quite normal. He was\ntense. \"I got here two weeks ago on a Q-and-C tramp from Regulus. We\nwere a ship load of salt meat. There's romance for you! Salt meat by\nthe spaceship load!\"\n\nThe doctor grunted again. All sorts of things moved through space,\nnaturally. The _Star Queen_ carried a botanical collection for a museum\nand pig-beryllium and furs and enzymes and a list of items no man could\nremember. He watched the passengers go by, automatically counting them\nagainst the number of health slips in his hand.\n\n\"Lots of passengers this trip,\" said Jensen.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the doctor, watching a man with a limp. \"Why?\"\n\nJensen shrugged and did not answer. He was uneasy, the doctor noted.\nHe and Jensen were as much unlike as two men could very well be, but\nJensen was good company. A ship's doctor does not have much congenial\nsociety.\n\nThe file of passengers ended abruptly. There was no one in the _Star\nQueen's_ airlock, but the \"Connected\" lights still burned and the\ndoctor could look through into the small lift-ship from the planet down\nbelow. He frowned. He fingered the sheaf of papers.\n\n\"Unless I missed count,\" he said annoyedly, \"there's supposed to be one\nmore passenger. I don't see--\"\n\nA door opened far back in the lift-ship. A small figure appeared. It\nwas a little girl perhaps ten years old. She was very neatly dressed,\nthough not quite the way a mother would have done it. She wore the\ncarefully composed expression of a child with no adult in charge of\nher. She walked precisely from the lift-ship into the _Star Queen's_\nlock. The opening closed briskly behind her. There was the rumbling of\nseals making themselves tight. The lights flickered for \"Disconnect\"\nand then \"All Clear.\" They went out, and the lift-ship had pulled away\nfrom the _Star Queen_.\n\n\"There's my missing passenger,\" said the doctor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe child looked soberly about. She saw him. \"Excuse me,\" she said very\npolitely. \"Is this the way I'm supposed to go?\"\n\n\"Through that door,\" said the doctor gruffly.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the little girl. She followed his direction. She\nvanished through the door. It closed.\n\nThere came a deep, droning sound, which was the interplanetary drive\nof the _Star Queen_, building up that directional stress in space\nwhich had seemed such a triumph when it was first contrived. The ship\nswung gently. It would be turning out from orbit around Altaira. It\nswung again. The doctor knew that its astrogators were feeling for the\nincredibly exact pointing of its nose toward the next port which modern\ncommercial ship operation required. An error of fractional seconds of\narc would mean valuable time lost in making port some ten light-years\nof distance away. The drive droned and droned, building up velocity\nwhile the ship's aiming was refined and re-refined.\n\nThe drive cut off abruptly. Jensen turned white.\n\nThe doctor said impatiently, \"There's nothing wrong. Probably a message\nor a report should have been beamed down to the planet and somebody\nforgot. We'll go on in a minute.\"\n\nBut Jensen stood frozen. He was very pale. The interplanetary drive\nstayed off. Thirty seconds. A minute. Jensen swallowed audibly. Two\nminutes. Three.\n\nThe steady, monotonous drone began again. It continued interminably, as\nif while it was off the ship's head had swung wide of its destination\nand the whole business of lining up for a jump in overdrive had to be\ndone all over again.\n\nThen there came that \"Ping-g-g-g!\" and the sensation of spiral fall\nwhich meant overdrive. The droning ceased.\n\nJensen breathed again. The ship's doctor looked at him sharply. Jensen\nhad been taut. Now the tensions had left his body, but he looked as\nif he were going to shiver. Instead, he mopped a suddenly streaming\nforehead.\n\n\"I think,\" said Jensen in a strange voice, \"that I'll have a drink. Or\nseveral. Will you join me?\"\n\nNordenfeld searched his face. A ship's doctor has many duties in\nspace. Passengers can have many things wrong with them, and in the\nabsolute isolation of overdrive they can be remarkably affected by each\nother.\n\n\"I'll be at the fourth-level bar in twenty minutes,\" said Nordenfeld.\n\"Can you wait that long?\"\n\n\"I probably won't wait to have a drink,\" said Jensen. \"But I'll be\nthere.\"\n\nThe doctor nodded curtly. He went away. He made no guesses, though he'd\njust observed the new passengers carefully and was fully aware of the\nstrict health regulations that affect space travel. As a physician he\nknew that the most deadly thing in the universe was chlorophage and\nthat the planet Kamerun was only one solar system away. It had been\na stop for the _Star Queen_ until four years ago. He puzzled over\nJensen's tenseness and the relief he'd displayed when the overdrive\nfield came on. But he didn't guess. Chlorophage didn't enter his mind.\n\nNot until later.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe saw the little girl who'd come out of the airlock last of all the\npassengers. She sat on a sofa as if someone had told her to wait there\nuntil something or other was arranged. Doctor Nordenfeld barely glanced\nat her. He'd known Jensen for a considerable time. Jensen had been\na passenger on the _Star Queen_ half a dozen times, and he shouldn't\nhave been upset by the temporary stoppage of an interplanetary drive.\nNordenfeld divided people into two classes, those who were not and\nthose who were worth talking to. There weren't many of the latter.\nJensen was.\n\nHe filed away the health slips. Then, thinking of Jensen's pallor,\nhe asked what had happened to make the _Star Queen_ interrupt her\nslow-speed drive away from orbit around Altaira.\n\nThe purser told him. But the purser was fussily concerned because there\nwere so many extra passengers from Altaira. He might not be able to\ntake on the expected number of passengers at the next stop-over point.\nIt would be bad business to have to refuse passengers! It would give\nthe space line a bad name.\n\nThen the air officer stopped Nordenfeld as he was about to join Jensen\nin the fourth-level bar. It was time for a medical inspection of the\nquarter-acre of Banthyan jungle which purified and renewed the air\nof the ship. Nordenfeld was expected to check the complex ecological\nsystem of the air room. Specifically, he was expected to look for and\nidentify any patches of colorlessness appearing on the foliage of the\njungle plants the _Star Queen_ carried through space.\n\nThe air officer was discreet and Nordenfeld was silent about the\nultimate reason for the inspection. Nobody liked to think about it. But\nif a particular kind of bleaching appeared, as if the chlorophyll of\nthe leaves were being devoured by something too small to be seen by an\noptical microscope--why, that would be chlorophage. It would also be a\ndeath sentence for the _Star Queen_ and everybody in her.\n\nBut the jungle passed medical inspection. The plants grew lushly in\nsoil which periodically was flushed with hydroponic solution and\nthen drained away again. The UV lamps were properly distributed and\nthe different quarters of the air room were alternately lighted and\ndarkened. And there were no colorless patches. A steady wind blew\nthrough the air room and had its excess moisture and unpleasing smells\nwrung out before it recirculated through the ship. Doctor Nordenfeld\nauthorized the trimming of some liana-like growths which were\ndeveloping woody tissue at the expense of leaves.\n\nThe air officer also told him about the reason for the turning off of\nthe interplanetary drive. He considered it a very curious happening.\n\nThe doctor left the air room and passed the place where the little\ngirl--the last passenger to board the _Star Queen_--waited patiently\nfor somebody to arrange something. Doctor Nordenfeld took a lift to the\nfourth level and went into the bar where Jensen should be waiting.\n\nHe was. He had an empty glass before him. Nordenfeld sat down and\ndialed for a drink. He had an indefinite feeling that something was\nwrong, but he couldn't put his finger on it. There are always things\ngoing wrong for a ship's doctor, though. There are so many demands on\nhis patience that he is usually short of it.\n\nJensen watched him sip at his drink.\n\n\"A bad day?\" he asked. He'd gotten over his own tension.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNordenfeld shrugged, but his scowl deepened. \"There are a lot of new\npassengers.\" He realized that he was trying to explain his feelings to\nhimself. \"They'll come to me feeling miserable. I have to tell each one\nthat if they feel heavy and depressed, it may be the gravity-constant\nof the ship, which is greater than their home planet. If they feel\nlight-headed and giddy, it may be because the gravity-constant of\nthe ship is less than they're used to. But it doesn't make them feel\nbetter, so they come back for a second assurance. I'll be overwhelmed\nwith such complaints within two hours.\"\n\nJensen waited. Then he said casually--too casually, \"Does anybody ever\nsuspect chlorophage?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Nordenfeld shortly.\n\nJensen fidgeted. He sipped. Then he said, \"What's the news from\nKamerun, anyhow?\"\n\n\"There isn't any,\" said Nordenfeld. \"Naturally! Why ask?\"\n\n\"I just wondered,\" said Jensen. After a moment: \"What was the last\nnews?\"\n\n\"There hasn't been a message from Kamerun in two years,\" said\nNordenfeld curtly. \"There's no sign of anything green anywhere on the\nplanet. It's considered to be--uninhabited.\"\n\nJensen licked his lips. \"That's what I understood. Yes.\"\n\nNordenfeld drank half his drink and said unpleasantly, \"There were\nthirty million people on Kamerun when the chlorophage appeared. At\nfirst it was apparently a virus which fed on the chlorophyll of\nplants. They died. Then it was discovered that it could also feed on\nhemoglobin, which is chemically close to chlorophyll. Hemoglobin is the\nred coloring matter of the blood. When the virus consumed it, people\nbegan to die. Kamerun doctors found that the chlorophage virus was\ntransmitted by contact, by inhalation, by ingestion. It traveled as\ndust particles and on the feet of insects, and it was in drinking water\nand the air one breathed. The doctors on Kamerun warned spaceships\noff and the Patrol put a quarantine fleet in orbit around it to keep\nanybody from leaving. And nobody left. And everybody died. _And_ so did\nevery living thing that had chlorophyll in its leaves or hemoglobin in\nits blood, or that needed plant or animal tissues to feed on. There's\nnot a person left alive on Kamerun, nor an animal or bird or insect,\nnor a fish nor a tree, or plant or weed or blade of grass. There's no\nlonger a quarantine fleet there. Nobody'll go there and there's nobody\nleft to leave. But there are beacon satellites to record any calls and\nto warn any fool against landing. If the chlorophage got loose and was\ncarried about by spaceships, it could kill the other forty billion\nhumans in the galaxy, together with every green plant or animal with\nhemoglobin in its blood.\"\n\n\"That,\" said Jensen, and tried to smile, \"sounds final.\"\n\n\"It isn't,\" Nordenfeld told him. \"If there's something in the\nuniverse which can kill every living thing except its maker, that\nsomething should be killed. There should be research going on about\nthe chlorophage. It would be deadly dangerous work, but it should be\ndone. A quarantine won't stop contagion. It can only hinder it. That's\nuseful, but not enough.\"\n\nJensen moistened his lips.\n\nNordenfeld said abruptly, \"I've answered your questions. Now what's on\nyour mind and what has it to do with chlorophage?\"\n\nJensen started. He went very pale.\n\n\"It's too late to do anything about it,\" said Nordenfeld. \"It's\nprobably nonsense anyhow. But what is it?\"\n\nJensen stammered out his story. It explained why there were so many\npassengers for the _Star Queen_. It even explained his departure from\nAltaira. But it was only a rumor--the kind of rumor that starts up\nuntraceably and can never be verified. This one was officially denied\nby the Altairan planetary government. But it was widely believed by the\nsort of people who usually were well-informed. Those who could sent\ntheir families up to the _Star Queen_. And that was why Jensen had been\ntense and worried until the liner had actually left Altaira behind.\nThen he felt safe.\n\nNordenfeld's jaw set as Jensen told his tale. He made no comment, but\nwhen Jensen was through he nodded and went away, leaving his drink\nunfinished. Jensen couldn't see his face; it was hard as granite.\n\nAnd Nordenfeld, the ship's doctor of the _Star Queen_, went into the\nnearest bathroom and was violently sick. It was a reaction to what he'd\njust learned.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were stars which were so far away that their distance didn't\nmean anything. There were planets beyond counting in a single star\ncluster, let alone the galaxy. There were comets and gas clouds in\nspace, and worlds where there was life, and other worlds where life was\nimpossible. The quantity of matter which was associated with life was\ninfinitesimal, and the quantity associated with consciousness--animal\nlife--was so much less that the difference couldn't be expressed.\nBut the amount of animal life which could reason was so minute by\ncomparison that the nearest ratio would be that of a single atom to\na sun. Mankind, in fact, was the least impressive fraction of the\nsmallest category of substance in the galaxy.\n\nBut men did curious things.\n\nThere was the cutting off of the _Star Queen's_ short-distance drive\nbefore she'd gotten well away from Altaira. There had been a lift-ship\nlocked to the liner's passenger airlock. When the last passenger\nentered the big ship--a little girl--the airlocks disconnected and the\nlift-ship pulled swiftly away.\n\nIt was not quite two miles from the _Star Queen_ when its emergency\nairlocks opened and spacesuited figures plunged out of it to emptiness.\nSimultaneously, the ports of the lift-ship glowed and almost\nimmediately the whole plating turned cherry-red, crimson, and then\norange, from unlimited heat developed within it.\n\nThe lift-ship went incandescent and ruptured and there was a spout\nof white-hot air, and then it turned blue-white and puffed itself to\nnothing in metallic steam. Where it had been there was only shining\ngas, which cooled. Beyond it there were figures in spacesuits which\ntried to swim away from it.\n\nThe _Star Queen's_ control room, obviously, saw the happening. The\nlift-ship's atomic pile had flared out of control and melted down the\nship. It had developed something like sixty thousand degrees Fahrenheit\nwhen it ceased to flare. It did not blow up; it only vaporized. But\nthe process must have begun within seconds after the lift-ship broke\ncontact with the _Star Queen_.\n\nIn automatic reaction, the man in control of the liner cut her drive\nand offered to turn back and pick up the spacesuited figures in\nemptiness. The offer was declined with almost hysterical haste. In\nfact, it was barely made before the other lift-ships moved in on rescue\nmissions. They had waited. And they were picking up castaways before\nthe _Star Queen_ resumed its merely interplanetary drive and the\nprocess of aiming for a solar system some thirty light-years away.\n\nWhen the liner flicked into overdrive, more than half the floating\nfigures had been recovered, which was remarkable. It was almost as\nremarkable as the flare-up of the lift-ship's atomic pile. One has\nto know exactly what to do to make a properly designed atomic pile\nvaporize metal. Somebody had known. Somebody had done it. And the other\nlift-ships were waiting to pick up the destroyed lift-ship's crew when\nit happened.\n\nThe matter of the lift-ship's destruction was fresh in Nordenfeld's\nmind when Jensen had told his story. The two items fitted together with\nan appalling completeness. They left little doubt or hope.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNordenfeld consulted the passenger records and presently was engaged in\nconversation with the sober-faced, composed little girl on a sofa in\none of the cabin levels of the _Star Queen_.\n\n\"You're Kathy Brand, I believe,\" he said matter-of-factly. \"I\nunderstand you've been having a rather bad time of it.\"\n\nShe seemed to consider.\n\n\"It hasn't been too bad,\" she assured him. \"At least I've been seeing\nnew things. I got dreadfully tired of seeing the same things all the\ntime.\"\n\n\"What things?\" asked Nordenfeld. His expression was not stern now,\nthough his inner sensations were not pleasant. He needed to talk to\nthis child, and he had learned how to talk to children. The secret is\nto talk exactly as to an adult, with respect and interest.\n\n\"There weren't any windows,\" she explained, \"and my father couldn't\nplay with me, and all the toys and books were ruined by the water. It\nwas dreadfully tedious. There weren't any other children, you see. And\npresently there weren't any grownups but my father.\"\n\nNordenfeld only looked more interested. He'd been almost sure ever\nsince knowing of the lift-ship's destruction and listening to Jensen's\naccount of the rumor the government of Altaira denied. He was horribly\nsure now.\n\n\"How long were you in the place that hadn't any windows?\"\n\n\"Oh, dreadfully long!\" she said. \"Since I was only six years old!\nAlmost half my life!\" She smiled brightly at him. \"I remember looking\nout of windows and even playing out-of-doors, but my father and mother\nsaid I had to live in this place. My father talked to me often and\noften. He was very nice. But he had to wear that funny suit and keep\nthe glass over his face because he didn't live in the room. The glass\nwas because he went under the water, you know.\"\n\nNordenfeld asked carefully conversational-sounding questions. Kathy\nBrand, now aged ten, had been taken by her father to live in a big room\nwithout any windows. It hadn't any doors, either. There were plants in\nit, and there were bluish lights to shine on the plants, and there was\na place in one corner where there was water. When her father came in to\ntalk to her, he came up out of the water wearing the funny suit with\nglass over his face. He went out the same way. There was a place in\nthe wall where she could look out into another room, and at first her\nmother used to come and smile at her through the glass, and she talked\ninto something she held in her hand, and her voice came inside. But\nlater she stopped coming.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was only one possible kind of place which would answer Kathy's\ndescription. When she was six years old she had been put into some\nuniversity's aseptic-environment room. And she had stayed there. Such\nrooms were designed for biological research. They were built and then\nmade sterile of all bacterial life and afterward entered through a tank\nof antiseptic. Anyone who entered wore a suit which was made germ-free\nby its passage through the antiseptic, and he did not breathe the air\nof the aseptic room, but air which was supplied him through a hose, the\nexhaled-air hose also passing under the antiseptic outside. No germ\nor microbe or virus could possibly get into such a room without being\nbathed in corrosive fluid which would kill it. So long as there was\nsomeone alive outside to take care of her, a little girl could live\nthere and defy even chlorophage.\n\nAnd Kathy Brand had done it. But, on the other hand, Kamerun was the\nonly planet where it would be necessary, and it was the only world\nfrom which a father would land his small daughter on another planet's\nspaceport. There was no doubt. Nordenfeld grimly imagined someone--he\nwould have had to be a microbiologist even to attempt it--fighting to\nsurvive and defeat the chlorophage while he kept his little girl in an\naseptic-environment room.\n\nShe explained quite pleasantly as Nordenfeld asked more questions.\nThere had been other people besides her father, but for a long time\nthere had been only him. And Nordenfeld computed that somehow she'd\nbeen kept alive on the dead planet Kamerun for four long years.\n\nRecently, though--very recently--her father told her that they were\nleaving. Wearing his funny, antiseptic-wetted suit, he'd enclosed her\nin a plastic bag with a tank attached to it. Air flowed from the tank\ninto the bag and out through a hose that was all wetted inside. She\nbreathed quite comfortably.\n\nIt made sense. An air tank could be heated and its contents sterilized\nto supply germ-free--or virus-free--air. And Kathy's father took an axe\nand chopped away a wall of the room. He picked her up, still inside the\nplastic bag, and carried her out. There was nobody about. There was no\ngrass. There were no trees. Nothing moved.\n\nHere Kathy's account was vague, but Nordenfeld could guess at the\nstrangeness of a dead planet, to the child who barely remembered\nanything but the walls of an aseptic-environment room.\n\nHer father carried her to a little ship, said Kathy, and they talked\na lot after the ship took off. He told her that he was taking her to\na place where she could run about outdoors and play, but he had to go\nsomewhere else. He did mysterious things which to Nordenfeld meant a\nmost scrupulous decontamination of a small spaceship's interior and\nits airlock. Its outer surface would reach a temperature at which no\norganic material could remain uncooked.\n\nAnd finally, said Kathy, her father had opened a door and told her to\nstep out and good-by, and she did, and the ship went away--her father\nstill wearing his funny suit--and people came and asked her questions\nshe did not understand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKathy's narrative fitted perfectly into the rumor Jensen said\ncirculated among usually well-informed people on Altaira. They\nbelieved, said Jensen, that a small spaceship had appeared in the sky\nabove Altaira's spaceport. It ignored all calls, landed swiftly, opened\nan airlock and let someone out, and plunged for the sky again. And the\nstory said that radar telescopes immediately searched for and found\nthe ship in space. They trailed it, calling vainly for it to identify\nitself, while it drove at top speed for Altaira's sun.\n\nIt reached the sun and dived in.\n\nNordenfeld reached the skipper on intercom vision-phone. Jensen had\nbeen called there to repeat his tale to the skipper.\n\n\"I've talked to the child,\" said Nordenfeld grimly, \"and I'm putting\nher into isolation quarters in the hospital compartment. She's from\nKamerun. She was kept in an aseptic-environment room at some university\nor other. She says her father looked after her. I get an impression of\na last-ditch fight by microbiologists against the chlorophage. They\nlost it. Apparently her father landed her on Altaira and dived into\nthe sun. From her story, he took every possible precaution to keep her\nfrom contagion or carrying contagion with her to Altaira. Maybe he\nsucceeded. There's no way to tell--yet.\"\n\nThe skipper listened in silence.\n\nJensen said thinly, \"Then the story about the landing was true.\"\n\n\"Yes. The authorities isolated her, and then shipped her off on the\n_Star Queen_. Your well-informed friends, Jensen, didn't know what\ntheir government was going to do!\" Nordenfeld paused, and said more\ncoldly still, \"They didn't handle it right. They should have killed\nher, painlessly but at once. Her body should have been immersed, with\neverything that had touched it, in full-strength nitric acid. The\nsame acid should have saturated the place where the ship landed and\nevery place she walked. Every room she entered, and every hall she\npassed through, should have been doused with nitric and then burned.\nIt would still not have been all one could wish. The air she breathed\ncouldn't be recaptured and heated white-hot. But the chances for\nAltaira's population to go on living would be improved. Instead, they\nisolated her and they shipped her off with us--and thought they were\naccomplishing something by destroying the lift-ship that had her in an\nairtight compartment until she walked into the _Star Queen's_ lock!\"\n\nThe skipper said heavily, \"Do you think she's brought chlorophage on\nboard?\"\n\n\"I've no idea,\" said Nordenfeld. \"If she did, it's too late to do\nanything but drive the _Star Queen_ into the nearest sun.... No. Before\nthat, one should give warning that she was aground on Altaira. No ship\nshould land there. No ship should take off. Altaira should be blocked\noff from the rest of the galaxy like Kamerun was. And to the same end\nresult.\"\n\nJensen said unsteadily; \"There'll be trouble if this is known on the\nship. There'll be some unwilling to sacrifice themselves.\"\n\n\"Sacrifice?\" said Nordenfeld. \"They're dead! But before they lie down,\nthey can keep everybody they care about from dying too! Would you want\nto land and have your wife and family die of it?\"\n\nThe skipper said in the same heavy voice, \"What are the probabilities?\nYou say there was an effort to keep her from contagion. What are the\nodds?\"\n\n\"Bad,\" said Nordenfeld. \"The man tried, for the child's sake. But I\ndoubt he managed to make a completely aseptic transfer from the room\nshe lived in to the spaceport on Altaira. The authorities on Altaira\nshould have known it. They should have killed her and destroyed\neverything she'd touched. And _still_ the odds would have been bad!\"\n\nJensen said, \"But you can't do that, Nordenfeld! Not now!\"\n\n\"I shall take every measure that seems likely to be useful.\" Then\nNordenfeld snapped, \"Damnation, man! Do you realize that this\nchlorophage can wipe out the human race if it really gets loose? Do you\nthink I'll let sentiment keep me from doing what has to be done?\"\n\nHe flicked off the vision-phone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Star Queen_ came out of overdrive. Her skipper arranged it to be\ndone at the time when the largest possible number of her passengers\nand crew would be asleep. Those who were awake, of course, felt the\npeculiar inaudible sensation which one subjectively translated into\nsound. They felt the momentary giddiness which--having no natural\nparallel--feels like the sensation of treading on a stair-step that\nisn't there, combined with a twisting sensation so it is like a spiral\nfall. The passengers who were awake were mostly in the bars, and the\nbartenders explained that the ship had shifted overdrive generators and\nthere was nothing to it.\n\nThose who were asleep started awake, but there was nothing in their\nsurroundings to cause alarm. Some blinked in the darkness of their\ncabins and perhaps turned on the cabin lights, but everything seemed\nnormal. They turned off the lights again. Some babies cried and had to\nbe soothed. But there was nothing except wakening to alarm anybody.\nBabies went back to sleep and mothers returned to their beds and--such\nawakenings being customary--went back to sleep also.\n\nIt was natural enough. There were vague and commonplace noises,\ntogether making an indefinite hum. Fans circulated the ship's purified\nand reinvigorated air. Service motors turned in remote parts of the\nhull. Cooks and bakers moved about in the kitchens. Nobody could tell\nby any physical sensation that the _Star Queen_ was not in overdrive,\nexcept in the control room.\n\nThere the stars could be seen. They were unthinkably remote. The ship\nwas light-years from any place where humans lived. She did not drive.\nHer skipper had a family on Cassim. He would not land a plague ship\nwhich might destroy them. The executive officer had a small son. If\nhis return meant that small son's death as well as his own, he would\nnot return. All through the ship, the officers who had to know the\nsituation recognized that if chlorophage had gotten into the _Star\nQueen_, the ship must not land anywhere. Nobody could survive. Nobody\nmust attempt it.\n\nSo the huge liner hung in the emptiness between the stars, waiting\nuntil it could be known definitely that chlorophage was aboard or that\nwith absolute certainty it was absent. The question was up to Doctor\nNordenfeld.\n\nHe had isolated himself with Kathy in the ship's hospital compartment.\nSince the ship was built it had been used once by a grown man who\ndeveloped mumps, and once by an adolescent boy who developed a raging\nfever which antibiotics stopped. Health measures for space travel were\nstrict. The hospital compartment had only been used those two times.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn this voyage it had been used to contain an assortment of botanical\nspecimens from a planet seventy light-years beyond Regulus. They were\non their way to the botanical research laboratory on Cassim. As a\nroutine precaution they'd been placed in the hospital, which could\nbe fumigated when they were taken out. Now the doctor had piled them\nin one side of the compartment, which he had divided in half with a\ntransparent plastic sheet. He stayed in that side. Kathy occupied the\nother.\n\nShe had some flowering plants to look at and admire. They'd come from\nthe air room and she was delighted with their coloring and beauty.\nBut Doctor Nordenfeld had put them there as a continuing test for\nchlorophage. If Kathy carried that murderous virus on her person, the\nflowering plants would die of it--probably even before she did.\n\nIt was a scrupulously scientific test for the deadly stuff. Completely\nsealed off except for a circulator to freshen the air she breathed,\nKathy was settled with toys and picture books. It was an improvised\nbut well-designed germproof room. The air for Kathy to breathe was\nsterilized before it reached her. The air she had breathed was\nsterilized as it left her plastic-sided residence. It should be the\nperfection of protection for the ship--if it was not already too late.\n\nThe vision-phone buzzed. Doctor Nordenfeld stirred in his chair and\nflipped the switch. The _Star Queen's_ skipper looked at him out of the\nscreen.\n\n\"I've cut the overdrive,\" said the skipper. \"The passengers haven't\nbeen told.\"\n\n\"Very sensible,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"When will we know?\"\n\n\"That we can go on living? When the other possibility is exhausted.\"\n\n\"Then, how will we know?\" asked skipper stonily.\n\nDoctor Nordenfeld ticked off the possibilities. He bent down a finger.\n\"One, her father took great pains. Maybe he did manage an aseptic\ntransfer from a germ-free room to Altaira. Kathy may not have been\nexposed to the chlorophage. If she hasn't, no bleached spots will show\nup on the air-room foliage or among the flowering plants in the room\nwith her. Nobody in the crew or among the passengers will die.\"\n\nHe bent down a second finger. \"It is probably more likely that white\nspots will appear on the plants in the air room _and_ here, and people\nwill start to die. That will mean Kathy brought contagion here the\ninstant she arrived, and almost certainly that Altaira will become like\nKamerun--uninhabited. In such a case we are finished.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe bent down a third finger. \"Not so likely, but preferable, white\nspots may appear on the foliage inside the plastic with Kathy, but not\nin the ship's air room. In that case she was exposed, but the virus was\nincubating when she came on board, and only developed and spread after\nshe was isolated. Possibly, in such a case, we can save the passengers\nand crew, but the ship will probably have to be melted down in space.\nIt would be tricky, but it might be done.\"\n\nThe skipper hesitated. \"If that last happened, she--\"\n\n\"I will take whatever measures are necessary,\" said Doctor Nordenfeld.\n\"To save your conscience, we won't discuss them. They should have been\ntaken on Altaira.\"\n\nHe reached over and flipped off the phone. Then he looked up and into\nthe other part of the ship's hospital space. Kathy came out from behind\na screen, where she'd made ready for bed. She was beaming. She had a\nlarge picture book under one arm and a doll under the other.\n\n\"It's all right for me to have these with me, isn't it, Doctor\nNordenfeld?\" she asked hopefully. \"I didn't have any picture books but\none, and it got worn out. And my doll--it was dreadful how shabby she\nwas!\"\n\nThe doctor frowned. She smiled at him. He said, \"After all, picture\nbooks are made to be looked at and dolls to be played with.\"\n\nShe skipped to the tiny hospital bed on the far side of the presumably\nvirusproof partition. She climbed into it and zestfully arranged the\ndoll to share it. She placed the book within easy reach.\n\nShe said, \"I think my father would say you were very nice, Doctor\nNordenfeld, to look after me so well.\"\n\n\"No-o-o-o,\" said the doctor in a detached voice. \"I'm just doing what\nanybody ought to do.\"\n\nShe snuggled down under the covers. He looked at his watch and\nshrugged. It was very easy to confuse official night with official day,\nin space. Everybody else was asleep. He'd been putting Kathy through\ntests which began with measurements of pulse and respiration and\ntemperature and went on from there. Kathy managed them herself, under\nhis direction.\n\nHe settled down with one of the medical books he'd brought into\nthe isolation section with him. Its title was _Decontamination of\nInfectious Material from Different Planets_. He read it grimly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe time came when the _Star Queen_ should have come out of overdrive\nwith the sun Circe blazing fiercely nearby, and a green planet with\nice caps to be approached on interplanetary drive. There should have\nbeen droning, comforting drive noises to assure the passengers--who\nnaturally could not see beyond the ship's steel walls--that they were\nwithin a mere few million miles of a world where sunshine was normal,\nand skies were higher than ship's ceilings, and there were fascinating\nthings to see and do.\n\nSome of the passengers packed their luggage and put it outside their\ncabins to be picked up for landing. But no stewards came for it.\nPresently there was an explanation. The ship had run under maximum\nspeed and the planetfall would be delayed.\n\nThe passengers were disappointed but not concerned. The luggage\nvanished into cabins again.\n\nThe _Star Queen_ floated in space among a thousand thousand million\nstars. Her astrogators had computed a course to the nearest star into\nwhich to drive the _Star Queen_, but it would not be used unless there\nwas mutiny among the crew. It would be better to go in remote orbit\naround Circe III and give the news of chlorophage on Altaira, if Doctor\nNordenfeld reported it on the ship.\n\nTime passed. One day. Two. Three. Then Jensen called the hospital\ncompartment on vision-phone. His expression was dazed. Nordenfeld saw\nthe interior of the control room behind Jensen. He said, \"You're a\npassenger, Jensen. How is it you're in the control room?\"\n\nJensen moistened his lips. \"The skipper thought I'd better not\nassociate with the other passengers. I've stayed with the officers the\npast few days. We--the ones who know what's in prospect--we're keeping\nseparate from the others so--nobody will let anything out by accident.\"\n\n\"Very wise. When the skipper comes back on duty, ask him to call me.\nI've something interesting to tell him.\"\n\n\"He's--checking something now,\" said Jensen. His voice was thin and\nreedy. \"The--air officer reports there are white patches on the plants\nin the air room. They're growing. Fast. He told me to tell you.\nHe's--gone to make sure.\"\n\n\"No need,\" said Nordenfeld bitterly.\n\nHe swung the vision-screen. It faced that part of the hospital space\nbeyond the plastic sheeting. There were potted flowering plants there.\nThey had pleased Kathy. They shared her air. And there were white\npatches on their leaves.\n\n\"I thought,\" said Nordenfeld with an odd mirthless levity, \"that the\nskipper'd be interested. It is of no importance whatever now, but\nI accomplished something remarkable. Kathy's father didn't manage\nan aseptic transfer. She brought the chlorophage with her. But I\nconfined it. The plants on the far side of that plastic sheet show the\nchlorophage patches plainly. I expect Kathy to show signs of anemia\nshortly. I'd decided that drastic measures would have to be taken,\nand it looked like they might work, because I've confined the virus.\nIt's there where Kathy is, but it isn't where I am. All the botanical\nspecimens on my side of the sheet are untouched. The phage hasn't hit\nthem. It is remarkable. But it doesn't matter a damn if the air room's\ninfected. And I was so proud!\"\n\nJensen did not respond.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNordenfeld said ironically, \"Look what I accomplished! I protected\nthe air plants on my side See? They're beautifully green! No sign of\ninfection! It means that a man can work with chlorophage! A laboratory\nship could land on Kamerun and keep itself the equivalent of an\naseptic-environment room while the damned chlorophage was investigated\nand ultimately whipped! And it doesn't matter!\"\n\nJensen said numbly, \"We can't ever make port. We ought--we ought to--\"\n\n\"We'll take the necessary measures,\" Nordenfeld told him. \"Very quietly\nand very efficiently, with neither the crew nor the passengers knowing\nthat Altaira sent the chlorophage on board the _Star Queen_ in the hope\nof banishing it from there. The passengers won't know that their own\nofficials shipped it off with them as they tried to run away.... And\nI was so proud that I'd improvised an aseptic room to keep Kathy in! I\nsterilized the air that went in to her, and I sterilized--\"\n\nThen he stopped. He stopped quite short. He stared at the air unit, set\nup and with two pipes passing through the plastic partition which cut\nthe hospital space in two. He turned utterly white. He went roughly to\nthe air machine. He jerked back its cover. He put his hand inside.\n\nMinutes later he faced back to the vision-screen from which Jensen\nlooked apathetically at him.\n\n\"Tell the skipper to call me,\" he said in a savage tone. \"Tell him to\ncall me instantly he comes back! Before he issues any orders at all!\"\n\nHe bent over the sterilizing equipment and very carefully began to\ndisassemble it. He had it completely apart when Kathy waked. She peered\nat him through the plastic separation sheet.\n\n\"Good morning, Doctor Nordenfeld,\" she said cheerfully.\n\nThe doctor grunted. Kathy smiled at him. She had gotten on very good\nterms with the doctor, since she'd been kept in the ship's hospital.\nShe did not feel that she was isolated. In having the doctor where she\ncould talk to him at any time, she had much more company than ever\nbefore. She had read her entire picture book to him and discussed her\ndoll at length. She took it for granted that when he did not answer or\nfrowned that he was simply busy. But he was company because she could\nsee him.\n\nDoctor Nordenfeld put the air apparatus together with an extremely\npeculiar expression on his face. It had been built for Kathy's special\nisolation by a ship's mechanic. It should sterilize the used air going\ninto Kathy's part of the compartment, and it should sterilize the\nused air pushed out by the supplied fresh air. The hospital itself\nwas an independent sealed unit, with its own chemical air freshener,\nand it had been divided into two. The air freshener was where Doctor\nNordenfeld could attend to it, and the sterilizer pump simply shared\nthe freshening with Kathy. But--\n\nBut the pipe that pumped air to Kathy was brown and discolored from\nhaving been used for sterilizing, and the pipe that brought air back\nwas not. It was cold. It had never been heated.\n\nSo Doctor Nordenfeld had been exposed to any contagion Kathy could\nspread. He hadn't been protected at all. Yet the potted plants on\nKathy's side of the barrier were marked with great white splotches\nwhich grew almost as one looked, while the botanical specimens in the\ndoctor's part of the hospital--as much infected as Kathy's could have\nbeen, by failure of the ship's mechanic to build the sterilizer to work\ntwo ways: the stacked plants, the alien plants, the strange plants from\nseventy light-years beyond Regulus--they were vividly green. There\nwas no trace of chlorophage on them. Yet they had been as thoroughly\nexposed as Doctor Nordenfeld himself!\n\nThe doctor's hands shook. His eyes burned. He took out a surgeon's\nscalpel and ripped the plastic partition from floor to ceiling. Kathy\nwatched interestedly.\n\n\"Why did you do that, Doctor Nordenfeld?\" she asked.\n\nHe said in an emotionless, unnatural voice, \"I'm going to do something\nthat it was very stupid of me not to do before. It should have been\ndone when you were six years old, Kathy. It should have been done on\nKamerun, and after that on Altaira. Now we're going to do it here. You\ncan help me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Star Queen_ had floated out of overdrive long enough to throw all\ndistance computations off. But she swung about, and swam back, and\npresently she was not too far from the world where she was now many\ndays overdue. Lift-ships started up from the planet's surface. But the\n_Star Queen_ ordered them back.\n\n\"Get your spaceport health officer on the vision-phone,\" ordered the\n_Star Queen's_ skipper. \"We've had chlorophage on board.\"\n\nThere was panic. Even at a distance of a hundred thousand miles,\nchlorophage could strike stark terror into anybody. But presently the\nimage of the spaceport health officer appeared on the _Star Queen's_\nscreen.\n\n\"We're not landing,\" said Doctor Nordenfeld. \"There's almost certainly\nan outbreak of chlorophage on Altaira, and we're going back to do\nsomething about it. It got on our ship with passengers from there.\nWe've whipped it, but we may need some help.\"\n\nThe image of the health officer aground was a mask of horror for\nseconds after Nordenfeld's last statement. Then his expression became\nincredulous, though still horrified.\n\n\"We came on to here,\" said Doctor Nordenfeld, \"to get you to send\nword by the first other ship to the Patrol that a quarantine has\nto be set up on Altaira, and we need to be inspected for recovery\nfrom chlorophage infection. And we need to pass on, officially, the\ndiscovery that whipped the contagion on this ship. We were carrying\nbotanical specimens to Cassim and we discovered that they were immune\nto chlorophage. That's absurd, of course. Their green coloring is the\nsame substance as in plants under Sol-type suns anywhere. They couldn't\nbe immune to chlorophage. So there had to be something else.\"\n\n\"Was--was there?\" asked the health officer.\n\n\"There was. Those specimens came from somewhere beyond Regulus. They\ncarried, as normal symbiotes on their foliage, microÃ¶rganisms unknown\nboth on Kamerun and Altaira. The alien bugs are almost the size of\nvirus particles, feed on virus particles, and are carried by contact,\nair, and so on, as readily as virus particles themselves. We discovered\nthat those microÃ¶rganisms devoured chlorophage. We washed them off the\nleaves of the plants, sprayed them in our air-room jungle, and they\nmultiplied faster than the chlorophage. Our whole air supply is now\nloaded with an airborne antichlorophage organism which has made our\ncrew and passengers immune. We're heading back to Altaira to turn loose\nour merry little bugs on that planet. It appears that they grow on\ncertain vegetation, but they'll live anywhere there's phage to eat.\nWe're keeping some chlorophage cultures alive so our microÃ¶rganisms\ndon't die out for lack of food!\"\n\nThe medical officer on the ground gasped. \"Keeping phage _alive_?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I hope you've recorded this,\" said Nordenfeld. \"It's rather important.\nThis trick should have been tried on Kamerun and Altaira and everywhere\nelse new diseases have turned up. When there's a bug on one planet\nthat's deadly to us, there's bound to be a bug on some other planet\nthat's deadly to it! The same goes for any pests or vermin--the\nprinciple of natural enemies. All we have to do is find the enemies!\"\n\nThere was more communication between the _Star Queen_ and the spaceport\non Circe III, which the _Star Queen_ would not make other contact with\non this trip, and presently the big liner headed back to Altaira. It\nwas necessary for official as well as humanitarian reasons. There would\nneed to be a health examination of the _Star Queen_ to certify that it\nwas safe for passengers to breathe her air and eat in her restaurants\nand swim in her swimming pools and occupy the six levels of passenger\ncabins she contained. This would have to be done by a Patrol ship,\nwhich would turn up at Altaira.\n\nThe _Star Queen's_ skipper would be praised by his owners for not\nhaving driven the liner into a star, and the purser would be forgiven\nfor the confusion in his records due to off-schedule operations of\nthe big ship, and Jensen would find in the ending of all terror of\nchlorophage an excellent reason to look for appreciation in the value\nof the investments he was checking up. And Doctor Nordenfeld....\n\nHe talked very gravely to Kathy. \"I'm afraid,\" he told her, \"that your\nfather isn't coming back. What would you like to do?\"\n\nShe smiled at him hopefully. \"Could I be your little girl?\" she asked.\nDoctor Nordenfeld grunted. \"Hm ... I'll think about it.\"\n\nBut he smiled at her. She grinned at him. And it was settled.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Doctor, by Murray Leinster\n\nNow, answer the question based on the story asconcisely as you can, using a single phrase if possible.

Johnson, St. Paul's Church-Yard.\n\nMDCCLXXXVIII\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT.\n\n\nIn delineating the Heroine of this Fiction, the Author attempts to\ndevelop a character different from those generally portrayed. This woman\nis neither a Clarissa, a Lady G----, nor a[A] Sophie.--It would be vain\nto mention the various modifications of these models, as it would to\nremark, how widely artists wander from nature, when they copy the\noriginals of great masters. They catch the gross parts; but the subtile\nspirit evaporates; and not having the just ties, affectation disgusts,\nwhen grace was expected to charm.\n\nThose compositions only have power to delight, and carry us willing\ncaptives, where the soul of the author is exhibited, and animates the\nhidden springs. Lost in a pleasing enthusiasm, they live in the scenes\nthey represent; and do not measure their steps in a beaten track,\nsolicitous to gather expected flowers, and bind them in a wreath,\naccording to the prescribed rules of art.\n\nThese chosen few, wish to speak for themselves, and not to be an\necho--even of the sweetest sounds--or the reflector of the most sublime\nbeams. The[B] paradise they ramble in, must be of their own creating--or\nthe prospect soon grows insipid, and not varied by a vivifying\nprinciple, fades and dies.\n\nIn an artless tale, without episodes, the mind of a woman, who has\nthinking powers is displayed. The female organs have been thought too\nweak for this arduous employment; and experience seems to justify the\nassertion. Without arguing physically about _possibilities_--in a\nfiction, such a being may be allowed to exist; whose grandeur is derived\nfrom the operations of its own faculties, not subjugated to opinion; but\ndrawn by the individual from the original source.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote A: Rousseau.]\n\n[Footnote B: I here give the Reviewers an opportunity of being very\nwitty about the Paradise of Fools, &c.]\n\n\n\n\nMARY\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. I.\n\n\nMary, the heroine of this fiction, was the daughter of Edward, who\nmarried Eliza, a gentle, fashionable girl, with a kind of indolence in\nher temper, which might be termed negative good-nature: her virtues,\nindeed, were all of that stamp. She carefully attended to the _shews_ of\nthings, and her opinions, I should have said prejudices, were such as\nthe generality approved of. She was educated with the expectation of a\nlarge fortune, of course became a mere machine: the homage of her\nattendants made a great part of her puerile amusements, and she never\nimagined there were any relative duties for her to fulfil: notions of\nher own consequence, by these means, were interwoven in her mind, and\nthe years of youth spent in acquiring a few superficial accomplishments,\nwithout having any taste for them. When she was first introduced into\nthe polite circle, she danced with an officer, whom she faintly wished\nto be united to; but her father soon after recommending another in a\nmore distinguished rank of life, she readily submitted to his will, and\npromised to love, honour, and obey, (a vicious fool,) as in duty bound.\n\nWhile they resided in London, they lived in the usual fashionable style,\nand seldom saw each other; nor were they much more sociable when they\nwooed rural felicity for more than half the year, in a delightful\ncountry, where Nature, with lavish hand, had scattered beauties around;\nfor the master, with brute, unconscious gaze, passed them by unobserved,\nand sought amusement in country sports. He hunted in the morning, and\nafter eating an immoderate dinner, generally fell asleep: this\nseasonable rest enabled him to digest the cumbrous load; he would then\nvisit some of his pretty tenants; and when he compared their ruddy glow\nof health with his wife's countenance, which even rouge could not\nenliven, it is not necessary to say which a _gourmand_ would give the\npreference to. Their vulgar dance of spirits were infinitely more\nagreeable to his fancy than her sickly, die-away languor. Her voice was\nbut the shadow of a sound, and she had, to complete her delicacy, so\nrelaxed her nerves, that she became a mere nothing.\n\nMany such noughts are there in the female world! yet she had a good\nopinion of her own merit,--truly, she said long prayers,--and sometimes\nread her Week's Preparation: she dreaded that horrid place vulgarly\ncalled _hell_, the regions below; but whether her's was a mounting\nspirit, I cannot pretend to determine; or what sort of a planet would\nhave been proper for her, when she left her _material_ part in this\nworld, let metaphysicians settle; I have nothing to say to her unclothed\nspirit.\n\nAs she was sometimes obliged to be alone, or only with her French\nwaiting-maid, she sent to the metropolis for all the new publications,\nand while she was dressing her hair, and she could turn her eyes from\nthe glass, she ran over those most delightful substitutes for bodily\ndissipation, novels. I say bodily, or the animal soul, for a rational\none can find no employment in polite circles. The glare of lights, the\nstudied inelegancies of dress, and the compliments offered up at the\nshrine of false beauty, are all equally addressed to the senses.\n\nWhen she could not any longer indulge the caprices of fancy one way, she\ntried another. The Platonic Marriage, Eliza Warwick, and some other\ninteresting tales were perused with eagerness. Nothing could be more\nnatural than the developement of the passions, nor more striking than\nthe views of the human heart. What delicate struggles! and uncommonly\npretty turns of thought! The picture that was found on a bramble-bush,\nthe new sensitive-plant, or tree, which caught the swain by the\nupper-garment, and presented to his ravished eyes a portrait.--Fatal\nimage!--It planted a thorn in a till then insensible heart, and sent a\nnew kind of a knight-errant into the world. But even this was nothing to\nthe catastrophe, and the circumstance on which it hung, the hornet\nsettling on the sleeping lover's face. What a _heart-rending_ accident!\nShe planted, in imitation of those susceptible souls, a rose bush; but\nthere was not a lover to weep in concert with her, when she watered it\nwith her tears.--Alas! Alas!\n\nIf my readers would excuse the sportiveness of fancy, and give me credit\nfor genius, I would go on and tell them such tales as would force the\nsweet tears of sensibility to flow in copious showers down beautiful\ncheeks, to the discomposure of rouge, &c. &c. Nay, I would make it so\ninteresting, that the fair peruser should beg the hair-dresser to\nsettle the curls himself, and not interrupt her.\n\nShe had besides another resource, two most beautiful dogs, who shared\nher bed, and reclined on cushions near her all the day. These she\nwatched with the most assiduous care, and bestowed on them the warmest\ncaresses. This fondness for animals was not that kind of\n_attendrissement_ which makes a person take pleasure in providing for\nthe subsistence and comfort of a living creature; but it proceeded from\nvanity, it gave her an opportunity of lisping out the prettiest French\nexpressions of ecstatic fondness, in accents that had never been attuned\nby tenderness.\n\nShe was chaste, according to the vulgar acceptation of the word, that\nis, she did not make any actual _faux pas_; she feared the world, and\nwas indolent; but then, to make amends for this seeming self-denial, she\nread all the sentimental novels, dwelt on the love-scenes, and, had she\nthought while she read, her mind would have been contaminated; as she\naccompanied the lovers to the lonely arbors, and would walk with them by\nthe clear light of the moon. She wondered her husband did not stay at\nhome. She was jealous--why did he not love her, sit by her side, squeeze\nher hand, and look unutterable things? Gentle reader, I will tell thee;\nthey neither of them felt what they could not utter. I will not pretend\nto say that they always annexed an idea to a word; but they had none of\nthose feelings which are not easily analyzed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. II.\n\n\nIn due time she brought forth a son, a feeble babe; and the following\nyear a daughter. After the mother's throes she felt very few sentiments\nof maternal tenderness: the children were given to nurses, and she\nplayed with her dogs. Want of exercise prevented the least chance of her\nrecovering strength; and two or three milk-fevers brought on a\nconsumption, to which her constitution tended. Her children all died in\ntheir infancy, except the two first, and she began to grow fond of the\nson, as he was remarkably handsome. For years she divided her time\nbetween the sofa, and the card-table. She thought not of death, though\non the borders of the grave; nor did any of the duties of her station\noccur to her as necessary. Her children were left in the nursery; and\nwhen Mary, the little blushing girl, appeared, she would send the\nawkward thing away. To own the truth, she was awkward enough, in a house\nwithout any play-mates; for her brother had been sent to school, and she\nscarcely knew how to employ herself; she would ramble about the garden,\nadmire the flowers, and play with the dogs. An old house-keeper told her\nstories, read to her, and, at last, taught her to read. Her mother\ntalked of enquiring for a governess when her health would permit; and,\nin the interim desired her own maid to teach her French. As she had\nlearned to read, she perused with avidity every book that came in her\nway. Neglected in every respect, and left to the operations of her own\nmind, she considered every thing that came under her inspection, and\nlearned to think. She had heard of a separate state, and that angels\nsometimes visited this earth. She would sit in a thick wood in the park,\nand talk to them; make little songs addressed to them, and sing them to\ntunes of her own composing; and her native wood notes wild were sweet\nand touching.\n\nHer father always exclaimed against female acquirements, and was glad\nthat his wife's indolence and ill health made her not trouble herself\nabout them. She had besides another reason, she did not wish to have a\nfine tall girl brought forward into notice as her daughter; she still\nexpected to recover, and figure away in the gay world. Her husband was\nvery tyrannical and passionate; indeed so very easily irritated when\ninebriated, that Mary was continually in dread lest he should frighten\nher mother to death; her sickness called forth all Mary's tenderness,\nand exercised her compassion so continually, that it became more than a\nmatch for self-love, and was the governing propensity of her heart\nthrough life. She was violent in her temper; but she saw her father's\nfaults, and would weep when obliged to compare his temper with her\nown.--She did more; artless prayers rose to Heaven for pardon, when she\nwas conscious of having erred; and her contrition was so exceedingly\npainful, that she watched diligently the first movements of anger and\nimpatience, to save herself this cruel remorse.\n\nSublime ideas filled her young mind--always connected with devotional\nsentiments; extemporary effusions of gratitude, and rhapsodies of\npraise would burst often from her, when she listened to the birds, or\npursued the deer. She would gaze on the moon, and ramble through the\ngloomy path, observing the various shapes the clouds assumed, and listen\nto the sea that was not far distant. The wandering spirits, which she\nimagined inhabited every part of nature, were her constant friends and\nconfidants. She began to consider the Great First Cause, formed just\nnotions of his attributes, and, in particular, dwelt on his wisdom and\ngoodness. Could she have loved her father or mother, had they returned\nher affection, she would not so soon, perhaps, have sought out a new\nworld.\n\nHer sensibility prompted her to search for an object to love; on earth\nit was not to be found: her mother had often disappointed her, and the\napparent partiality she shewed to her brother gave her exquisite\npain--produced a kind of habitual melancholy, led her into a fondness\nfor reading tales of woe, and made her almost realize the fictitious\ndistress.\n\nShe had not any notion of death till a little chicken expired at her\nfeet; and her father had a dog hung in a passion. She then concluded\nanimals had souls, or they would not have been subjected to the caprice\nof man; but what was the soul of man or beast? In this style year after\nyear rolled on, her mother still vegetating.\n\nA little girl who attended in the nursery fell sick. Mary paid her great\nattention; contrary to her wish, she was sent out of the house to her\nmother, a poor woman, whom necessity obliged to leave her sick child\nwhile she earned her daily bread. The poor wretch, in a fit of delirium\nstabbed herself, and Mary saw her dead body, and heard the dismal\naccount; and so strongly did it impress her imagination, that every\nnight of her life the bleeding corpse presented itself to her when the\nfirst began to slumber. Tortured by it, she at last made a vow, that if\nshe was ever mistress of a family she would herself watch over every\npart of it. The impression that this accident made was indelible.\n\nAs her mother grew imperceptibly worse and worse, her father, who did\nnot understand such a lingering complaint, imagined his wife was only\ngrown still more whimsical, and that if she could be prevailed on to\nexert herself, her health would soon be re-established. In general he\ntreated her with indifference; but when her illness at all interfered\nwith his pleasures, he expostulated in the most cruel manner, and\nvisibly harassed the invalid. Mary would then assiduously try to turn\nhis attention to something else; and when sent out of the room, would\nwatch at the door, until the storm was over, for unless it was, she\ncould not rest. Other causes also contributed to disturb her repose: her\nmother's luke-warm manner of performing her religious duties, filled her\nwith anguish; and when she observed her father's vices, the unbidden\ntears would flow. She was miserable when beggars were driven from the\ngate without being relieved; if she could do it unperceived, she would\ngive them her own breakfast, and feel gratified, when, in consequence of\nit, she was pinched by hunger.\n\nShe had once, or twice, told her little secrets to her mother; they were\nlaughed at, and she determined never to do it again. In this manner was\nshe left to reflect on her own feelings; and so strengthened were they\nby being meditated on, that her character early became singular and\npermanent. Her understanding was strong and clear, when not clouded by\nher feelings; but she was too much the creature of impulse, and the\nslave of compassion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. III.\n\n\nNear her father's house lived a poor widow, who had been brought up in\naffluence, but reduced to great distress by the extravagance of her\nhusband; he had destroyed his constitution while he spent his fortune;\nand dying, left his wife, and five small children, to live on a very\nscanty pittance. The eldest daughter was for some years educated by a\ndistant relation, a Clergyman. While she was with him a young gentleman,\nson to a man of property in the neighbourhood, took particular notice of\nher. It is true, he never talked of love; but then they played and sung\nin concert; drew landscapes together, and while she worked he read to\nher, cultivated her taste, and stole imperceptibly her heart. Just at\nthis juncture, when smiling, unanalyzed hope made every prospect bright,\nand gay expectation danced in her eyes, her benefactor died. She\nreturned to her mother--the companion of her youth forgot her, they took\nno more sweet counsel together. This disappointment spread a sadness\nover her countenance, and made it interesting. She grew fond of\nsolitude, and her character appeared similar to Mary's, though her\nnatural disposition was very different.\n\nShe was several years older than Mary, yet her refinement, her taste,\ncaught her eye, and she eagerly sought her friendship: before her return\nshe had assisted the family, which was almost reduced to the last ebb;\nand now she had another motive to actuate her.\n\nAs she had often occasion to send messages to Ann, her new friend,\nmistakes were frequently made; Ann proposed that in future they should\nbe written ones, to obviate this difficulty, and render their\nintercourse more agreeable. Young people are mostly fond of scribbling;\nMary had had very little instruction; but by copying her friend's\nletters, whose hand she admired, she soon became a proficient; a little\npractice made her write with tolerable correctness, and her genius gave\nforce to it. In conversation, and in writing, when she felt, she was\npathetic, tender and persuasive; and she expressed contempt with such\nenergy, that few could stand the flash of her eyes.\n\nAs she grew more intimate with Ann, her manners were softened, and she\nacquired a degree of equality in her behaviour: yet still her spirits\nwere fluctuating, and her movements rapid. She felt less pain on\naccount of her mother's partiality to her brother, as she hoped now to\nexperience the pleasure of being beloved; but this hope led her into new\nsorrows, and, as usual, paved the way for disappointment. Ann only felt\ngratitude; her heart was entirely engrossed by one object, and\nfriendship could not serve as a substitute; memory officiously retraced\npast scenes, and unavailing wishes made time loiter.\n\nMary was often hurt by the involuntary indifference which these\nconsequences produced. When her friend was all the world to her, she\nfound she was not as necessary to her happiness; and her delicate mind\ncould not bear to obtrude her affection, or receive love as an alms, the\noffspring of pity. Very frequently has she ran to her with delight, and\nnot perceiving any thing of the same kind in Ann's countenance, she has\nshrunk back; and, falling from one extreme into the other, instead of a\nwarm greeting that was just slipping from her tongue, her expressions\nseemed to be dictated by the most chilling insensibility.\n\nShe would then imagine that she looked sickly or unhappy, and then all\nher tenderness would return like a torrent, and bear away all\nreflection. In this manner was her sensibility called forth, and\nexercised, by her mother's illness, her friend's misfortunes, and her\nown unsettled mind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. IV.\n\n\nNear to her father's house was a range of mountains; some of them were,\nliterally speaking, cloud-capt, for on them clouds continually rested,\nand gave grandeur to the prospect; and down many of their sides the\nlittle bubbling cascades ran till they swelled a beautiful river.\nThrough the straggling trees and bushes the wind whistled, and on them\nthe birds sung, particularly the robins; they also found shelter in the\nivy of an old castle, a haunted one, as the story went; it was situated\non the brow of one of the mountains, and commanded a view of the sea.\nThis castle had been inhabited by some of her ancestors; and many tales\nhad the old house-keeper told her of the worthies who had resided there.\n\nWhen her mother frowned, and her friend looked cool, she would steal to\nthis retirement, where human foot seldom trod--gaze on the sea, observe\nthe grey clouds, or listen to the wind which struggled to free itself\nfrom the only thing that impeded its course. When more cheerful, she\nadmired the various dispositions of light and shade, the beautiful tints\nthe gleams of sunshine gave to the distant hills; then she rejoiced in\nexistence, and darted into futurity.\n\nOne way home was through the cavity of a rock covered with a thin layer\nof earth, just sufficient to afford nourishment to a few stunted shrubs\nand wild plants, which grew on its sides, and nodded over the summit. A\nclear stream broke out of it, and ran amongst the pieces of rocks\nfallen into it. Here twilight always reigned--it seemed the Temple of\nSolitude; yet, paradoxical as the assertion may appear, when the foot\nsounded on the rock, it terrified the intruder, and inspired a strange\nfeeling, as if the rightful sovereign was dislodged. In this retreat she\nread Thomson's Seasons, Young's Night-Thoughts, and Paradise Lost.\n\nAt a little distance from it were the huts of a few poor fishermen, who\nsupported their numerous children by their precarious labour. In these\nlittle huts she frequently rested, and denied herself every childish\ngratification, in order to relieve the necessities of the inhabitants.\nHer heart yearned for them, and would dance with joy when she had\nrelieved their wants, or afforded them pleasure.\n\nIn these pursuits she learned the luxury of doing good; and the sweet\ntears of benevolence frequently moistened her eyes, and gave them a\nsparkle which, exclusive of that, they had not; on the contrary, they\nwere rather fixed, and would never have been observed if her soul had\nnot animated them. They were not at all like those brilliant ones which\nlook like polished diamonds, and dart from every superfice, giving more\nlight to the beholders than they receive themselves.\n\nHer benevolence, indeed, knew no bounds; the distress of others carried\nher out of herself; and she rested not till she had relieved or\ncomforted them. The warmth of her compassion often made her so diligent,\nthat many things occurred to her, which might have escaped a less\ninterested observer.\n\nIn like manner, she entered with such spirit into whatever she read,\nand the emotions thereby raised were so strong, that it soon became a\npart of her mind.\n\nEnthusiastic sentiments of devotion at this period actuated her; her\nCreator was almost apparent to her senses in his works; but they were\nmostly the grand or solemn features of Nature which she delighted to\ncontemplate. She would stand and behold the waves rolling, and think of\nthe voice that could still the tumultuous deep.\n\nThese propensities gave the colour to her mind, before the passions\nbegan to exercise their tyrannic sway, and particularly pointed out\nthose which the soil would have a tendency to nurse.\n\nYears after, when wandering through the same scenes, her imagination has\nstrayed back, to trace the first placid sentiments they inspired, and\nshe would earnestly desire to regain the same peaceful tranquillity.\n\nMany nights she sat up, if I may be allowed the expression, _conversing_\nwith the Author of Nature, making verses, and singing hymns of her own\ncomposing. She considered also, and tried to discern what end her\nvarious faculties were destined to pursue; and had a glimpse of a truth,\nwhich afterwards more fully unfolded itself.\n\nShe thought that only an infinite being could fill the human soul, and\nthat when other objects were followed as a means of happiness, the\ndelusion led to misery, the consequence of disappointment. Under the\ninfluence of ardent affections, how often has she forgot this\nconviction, and as often returned to it again, when it struck her with\nredoubled force. Often did she taste unmixed delight; her joys, her\necstacies arose from genius.\n\nShe was now fifteen, and she wished to receive the holy sacrament; and\nperusing the scriptures, and discussing some points of doctrine which\npuzzled her, she would sit up half the night, her favourite time for\nemploying her mind; she too plainly perceived that she saw through a\nglass darkly; and that the bounds set to stop our intellectual\nresearches, is one of the trials of a probationary state.\n\nBut her affections were roused by the display of divine mercy; and she\neagerly desired to commemorate the dying love of her great benefactor.\nThe night before the important day, when she was to take on herself her\nbaptismal vow, she could not go to bed; the sun broke in on her\nmeditations, and found her not exhausted by her watching.\n\nThe orient pearls were strewed around--she hailed the morn, and sung\nwith wild delight, Glory to God on high, good will towards men. She was\nindeed so much affected when she joined in the prayer for her eternal\npreservation, that she could hardly conceal her violent emotions; and\nthe recollection never failed to wake her dormant piety when earthly\npassions made it grow languid.\n\nThese various movements of her mind were not commented on, nor were the\nluxuriant shoots restrained by culture. The servants and the poor adored\nher.\n\nIn order to be enabled to gratify herself in the highest degree, she\npracticed the most rigid oeconomy, and had such power over her\nappetites and whims, that without any great effort she conquered them\nso entirely, that when her understanding or affections had an object,\nshe almost forgot she had a body which required nourishment.\n\nThis habit of thinking, this kind of absorption, gave strength to the\npassions.\n\nWe will now enter on the more active field of life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. V.\n\n\nA few months after Mary was turned of seventeen, her brother was\nattacked by a violent fever, and died before his father could reach the\nschool.\n\nShe was now an heiress, and her mother began to think her of\nconsequence, and did not call her _the child_. Proper masters were sent\nfor; she was taught to dance, and an extraordinary master procured to\nperfect her in that most necessary of all accomplishments.\n\nA part of the estate she was to inherit had been litigated, and the heir\nof the person who still carried on a Chancery suit, was only two years\nyounger than our heroine. The fathers, spite of the dispute, frequently\nmet, and, in order to settle it amicably, they one day, over a bottle,\ndetermined to quash it by a marriage, and, by uniting the two estates,\nto preclude all farther enquiries into the merits of their different\nclaims.\n\nWhile this important matter was settling, Mary was otherwise employed.\nAnn's mother's resources were failing; and the ghastly phantom, poverty,\nmade hasty strides to catch them in his clutches. Ann had not fortitude\nenough to brave such accumulated misery; besides, the canker-worm was\nlodged in her heart, and preyed on her health. She denied herself every\nlittle comfort; things that would be no sacrifice when a person is well,\nare absolutely necessary to alleviate bodily pain, and support the\nanimal functions.\n\nThere were many elegant amusements, that she had acquired a relish for,\nwhich might have taken her mind off from its most destructive bent; but\nthese her indigence would not allow her to enjoy: forced then, by way of\nrelaxation, to play the tunes her lover admired, and handle the pencil\nhe taught her to hold, no wonder his image floated on her imagination,\nand that taste invigorated love.\n\nPoverty, and all its inelegant attendants, were in her mother's abode;\nand she, though a good sort of a woman, was not calculated to banish, by\nher trivial, uninteresting chat, the delirium in which her daughter was\nlost.\n\nThis ill-fated love had given a bewitching softness to her manners, a\ndelicacy so truly feminine, that a man of any feeling could not behold\nher without wishing to chase her sorrows away. She was timid and\nirresolute, and rather fond of dissipation; grief only had power to make\nher reflect.\n\nIn every thing it was not the great, but the beautiful, or the pretty,\nthat caught her attention. And in composition, the polish of style, and\nharmony of numbers, interested her much more than the flights of genius,\nor abstracted speculations.\n\nShe often wondered at the books Mary chose, who, though she had a lively\nimagination, would frequently study authors whose works were addressed\nto the understanding. This liking taught her to arrange her thoughts,\nand argue with herself, even when under the influence of the most\nviolent passions.\n\nAnn's misfortunes and ill health were strong ties to bind Mary to her;\nshe wished so continually to have a home to receive her in, that it\ndrove every other desire out of her mind; and, dwelling on the tender\nschemes which compassion and friendship dictated, she longed most\nardently to put them in practice.\n\nFondly as she loved her friend, she did not forget her mother, whose\ndecline was so imperceptible, that they were not aware of her\napproaching dissolution. The physician, however, observing the most\nalarming symptoms; her husband was apprised of her immediate danger; and\nthen first mentioned to her his designs with respect to his daughter.\n\nShe approved of them; Mary was sent for; she was not at home; she had\nrambled to visit Ann, and found her in an hysteric fit. The landlord of\nher little farm had sent his agent for the rent, which had long been due\nto him; and he threatened to seize the stock that still remained, and\nturn them out, if they did not very shortly discharge the arrears.\n\nAs this man made a private fortune by harassing the tenants of the\nperson to whom he was deputy, little was to be expected from his\nforbearance.\n\nAll this was told to Mary--and the mother added, she had many other\ncreditors who would, in all probability, take the alarm, and snatch from\nthem all that had been saved out of the wreck. \"I could bear all,\" she\ncried; \"but what will become of my children? Of this child,\" pointing to\nthe fainting Ann, \"whose constitution is already undermined by care and\ngrief--where will she go?\"--Mary's heart ceased to beat while she asked\nthe question--She attempted to speak; but the inarticulate sounds died\naway. Before she had recovered herself, her father called himself to\nenquire for her; and desired her instantly to accompany him home.\n\nEngrossed by the scene of misery she had been witness to, she walked\nsilently by his side, when he roused her out of her reverie by telling\nher that in all likelihood her mother had not many hours to live; and\nbefore she could return him any answer, informed her that they had both\ndetermined to marry her to Charles, his friend's son; he added, the\nceremony was to be performed directly, that her mother might be witness\nof it; for such a desire she had expressed with childish eagerness.\n\nOverwhelmed by this intelligence, Mary rolled her eyes about, then, with\na vacant stare, fixed them on her father's face; but they were no longer\na sense; they conveyed no ideas to the brain. As she drew near the\nhouse, her wonted presence of mind returned: after this suspension of\nthought, a thousand darted into her mind,--her dying mother,--her\nfriend's miserable situation,--and an extreme horror at taking--at being\nforced to take, such a hasty step; but she did not feel the disgust, the\nreluctance, which arises from a prior attachment.\n\nShe loved Ann better than any one in the world--to snatch her from the\nvery jaws of destruction--she would have encountered a lion. To have\nthis friend constantly with her; to make her mind easy with respect to\nher family, would it not be superlative bliss?\n\nFull of these thoughts she entered her mother's chamber, but they then\nfled at the sight of a dying parent. She went to her, took her hand; it\nfeebly pressed her's. \"My child,\" said the languid mother: the words\nreached her heart; she had seldom heard them pronounced with accents\ndenoting affection; \"My child, I have not always treated you with\nkindness--God forgive me! do you?\"--Mary's tears strayed in a\ndisregarded stream; on her bosom the big drops fell, but did not relieve\nthe fluttering tenant. \"I forgive you!\" said she, in a tone of\nastonishment.\n\nThe clergyman came in to read the service for the sick, and afterwards\nthe marriage ceremony was performed. Mary stood like a statue of\nDespair, and pronounced the awful vow without thinking of it; and then\nran to support her mother, who expired the same night in her arms.\n\nHer husband set off for the continent the same day, with a tutor, to\nfinish his studies at one of the foreign universities.\n\nAnn was sent for to console her, not on account of the departure of her\nnew relation, a boy she seldom took any notice of, but to reconcile her\nto her fate; besides, it was necessary she should have a female\ncompanion, and there was not any maiden aunt in the family, or cousin of\nthe same class.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VI.\n\n\nMary was allowed to pay the rent which gave her so much uneasiness, and\nshe exerted every nerve to prevail on her father effectually to succour\nthe family; but the utmost she could obtain was a small sum very\ninadequate to the purpose, to enable the poor woman to carry into\nexecution a little scheme of industry near the metropolis.\n\nHer intention of leaving that part of the country, had much more weight\nwith him, than Mary's arguments, drawn from motives of philanthropy and\nfriendship; this was a language he did not understand; expressive of\noccult qualities he never thought of, as they could not be seen or\nfelt.\n\nAfter the departure of her mother, Ann still continued to languish,\nthough she had a nurse who was entirely engrossed by the desire of\namusing her. Had her health been re-established, the time would have\npassed in a tranquil, improving manner.\n\nDuring the year of mourning they lived in retirement; music, drawing,\nand reading, filled up the time; and Mary's taste and judgment were both\nimproved by contracting a habit of observation, and permitting the\nsimple beauties of Nature to occupy her thoughts.\n\nShe had a wonderful quickness in discerning distinctions and combining\nideas, that at the first glance did not appear to be similar. But these\nvarious pursuits did not banish all her cares, or carry off all her\nconstitutional black bile. Before she enjoyed Ann's society, she\nimagined it would have made her completely happy: she was disappointed,\nand yet knew not what to complain of.\n\nAs her friend could not accompany her in her walks, and wished to be\nalone, for a very obvious reason, she would return to her old haunts,\nretrace her anticipated pleasures--and wonder how they changed their\ncolour in possession, and proved so futile.\n\nShe had not yet found the companion she looked for. Ann and she were not\ncongenial minds, nor did she contribute to her comfort in the degree she\nexpected. She shielded her from poverty; but this was only a negative\nblessing; when under the pressure it was very grievous, and still more\nso were the apprehensions; but when exempt from them, she was not\ncontented.\n\nSuch is human nature, its laws were not to be inverted to gratify our\nheroine, and stop the progress of her understanding, happiness only\nflourished in paradise--we cannot taste and live.\n\nAnother year passed away with increasing apprehensions. Ann had a hectic\ncough, and many unfavourable prognostics: Mary then forgot every thing\nbut the fear of losing her, and even imagined that her recovery would\nhave made her happy.\n\nHer anxiety led her to study physic, and for some time she only read\nbooks of that cast; and this knowledge, literally speaking, ended in\nvanity and vexation of spirit, as it enabled her to foresee what she\ncould not prevent.\n\nAs her mind expanded, her marriage appeared a dreadful misfortune; she\nwas sometimes reminded of the heavy yoke, and bitter was the\nrecollection!\n\nIn one thing there seemed to be a sympathy between them, for she wrote\nformal answers to his as formal letters. An extreme dislike took root in\nher mind; the found of his name made her turn sick; but she forgot all,\nlistening to Ann's cough, and supporting her languid frame. She would\nthen catch her to her bosom with convulsive eagerness, as if to save her\nfrom sinking into an opening grave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VII.\n\n\nIt was the will of Providence that Mary should experience almost every\nspecies of sorrow. Her father was thrown from his horse, when his blood\nwas in a very inflammatory state, and the bruises were very dangerous;\nhis recovery was not expected by the physical tribe.\n\nTerrified at seeing him so near death, and yet so ill prepared for it,\nhis daughter sat by his bed, oppressed by the keenest anguish, which her\npiety increased.\n\nHer grief had nothing selfish in it; he was not a friend or protector;\nbut he was her father, an unhappy wretch, going into eternity, depraved\nand thoughtless. Could a life of sensuality be a preparation for a\npeaceful death? Thus meditating, she passed the still midnight hour by\nhis bedside.\n\nThe nurse fell asleep, nor did a violent thunder storm interrupt her\nrepose, though it made the night appear still more terrific to Mary. Her\nfather's unequal breathing alarmed her, when she heard a long drawn\nbreath, she feared it was his last, and watching for another, a dreadful\npeal of thunder struck her ears. Considering the separation of the soul\nand body, this night seemed sadly solemn, and the hours long.\n\nDeath is indeed a king of terrors when he attacks the vicious man! The\ncompassionate heart finds not any comfort; but dreads an eternal\nseparation. No transporting greetings are anticipated, when the\nsurvivors also shall have finished their course; but all is black!--the\ngrave may truly be said to receive the departed--this is the sting of\ndeath!\n\nNight after night Mary watched, and this excessive fatigue impaired her\nown health, but had a worse effect on Ann; though she constantly went to\nbed, she could not rest; a number of uneasy thoughts obtruded\nthemselves; and apprehensions about Mary, whom she loved as well as her\nexhausted heart could love, harassed her mind. After a sleepless,\nfeverish night she had a violent fit of coughing, and burst a\nblood-vessel. The physician, who was in the house, was sent for, and\nwhen he left the patient, Mary, with an authoritative voice, insisted on\nknowing his real opinion. Reluctantly he gave it, that her friend was in\na critical state; and if she passed the approaching winter in England,\nhe imagined she would die in the spring; a season fatal to consumptive\ndisorders. The spring!--Her husband was then expected.--Gracious Heaven,\ncould she bear all this.\n\nIn a few days her father breathed his last. The horrid sensations his\ndeath occasioned were too poignant to be durable: and Ann's danger, and\nher own situation, made Mary deliberate what mode of conduct she should\npursue. She feared this event might hasten the return of her husband,\nand prevent her putting into execution a plan she had determined on. It\nwas to accompany Ann to a more salubrious climate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VIII.\n\n\nI mentioned before, that Mary had never had any particular attachment,\nto give rise to the disgust that daily gained ground. Her friendship for\nAnn occupied her heart, and resembled a passion. She had had, indeed,\nseveral transient likings; but they did not amount to love. The society\nof men of genius delighted her, and improved her faculties. With beings\nof this class she did not often meet; it is a rare genus; her first\nfavourites were men past the meridian of life, and of a philosophic\nturn.\n\nDetermined on going to the South of France, or Lisbon; she wrote to the\nman she had promised to obey. The physicians had said change of air was\nnecessary for her as well as her friend. She mentioned this, and added,\n\"Her comfort, almost her existence, depended on the recovery of the\ninvalid she wished to attend; and that should she neglect to follow the\nmedical advice she had received, she should never forgive herself, or\nthose who endeavoured to prevent her.\" Full of her design, she wrote\nwith more than usual freedom; and this letter was like most of her\nothers, a transcript of her heart.\n\n\"This dear friend,\" she exclaimed, \"I love for her agreeable qualities,\nand substantial virtues. Continual attention to her health, and the\ntender office of a nurse, have created an affection very like a maternal\none--I am her only support, she leans on me--could I forsake the\nforsaken, and break the bruised reed--No--I would die first! I must--I\nwill go.\"\n\nShe would have added, \"you would very much oblige me by consenting;\" but\nher heart revolted--and irresolutely she wrote something about wishing\nhim happy.--\"Do I not wish all the world well?\" she cried, as she\nsubscribed her name--It was blotted, the letter sealed in a hurry, and\nsent out of her sight; and she began to prepare for her journey.\n\nBy the return of the post she received an answer; it contained some\ncommon-place remarks on her romantic friendship, as he termed it; \"But\nas the physicians advised change of air, he had no objection.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. IX.\n\n\nThere was nothing now to retard their journey; and Mary chose Lisbon\nrather than France, on account of its being further removed from the\nonly person she wished not to see.\n\nThey set off accordingly for Falmouth, in their way to that city. The\njourney was of use to Ann, and Mary's spirits were raised by her\nrecovered looks--She had been in despair--now she gave way to hope, and\nwas intoxicated with it. On ship-board Ann always remained in the cabin;\nthe sight of the water terrified her: on the contrary, Mary, after she\nwas gone to bed, or when she fell asleep in the day, went on deck,\nconversed with the sailors, and surveyed the boundless expanse before\nher with delight. One instant she would regard the ocean, the next the\nbeings who braved its fury. Their insensibility and want of fear, she\ncould not name courage; their thoughtless mirth was quite of an animal\nkind, and their feelings as impetuous and uncertain as the element they\nplowed.\n\nThey had only been a week at sea when they hailed the rock of Lisbon,\nand the next morning anchored at the castle. After the customary visits,\nthey were permitted to go on shore, about three miles from the city; and\nwhile one of the crew, who understood the language, went to procure them\none of the ugly carriages peculiar to the country, they waited in the\nIrish convent, which is situated close to the Tagus.\n\nSome of the people offered to conduct them into the church, where there\nwas a fine organ playing; Mary followed them, but Ann preferred staying\nwith a nun she had entered into conversation with.\n\nOne of the nuns, who had a sweet voice, was singing; Mary was struck\nwith awe; her heart joined in the devotion; and tears of gratitude and\ntenderness flowed from her eyes. My Father, I thank thee! burst from\nher--words were inadequate to express her feelings. Silently, she\nsurveyed the lofty dome; heard unaccustomed sounds; and saw faces,\nstrange ones, that she could not yet greet with fraternal love.\n\nIn an unknown land, she considered that the Being she adored inhabited\neternity, was ever present in unnumbered worlds. When she had not any\none she loved near her, she was particularly sensible of the presence\nof her Almighty Friend.\n\nThe arrival of the carriage put a stop to her speculations; it was to\nconduct them to an hotel, fitted up for the reception of invalids.\nUnfortunately, before they could reach it there was a violent shower of\nrain; and as the wind was very high, it beat against the leather\ncurtains, which they drew along the front of the vehicle, to shelter\nthemselves from it; but it availed not, some of the rain forced its way,\nand Ann felt the effects of it, for she caught cold, spite of Mary's\nprecautions.\n\nAs is the custom, the rest of the invalids, or lodgers, sent to enquire\nafter their health; and as soon as Ann left her chamber, in which her\ncomplaints seldom confined her the whole day, they came in person to pay\ntheir compliments. Three fashionable females, and two gentlemen; the\none a brother of the eldest of the young ladies, and the other an\ninvalid, who came, like themselves, for the benefit of the air. They\nentered into conversation immediately.\n\nPeople who meet in a strange country, and are all together in a house,\nsoon get acquainted, without the formalities which attend visiting in\nseparate houses, where they are surrounded by domestic friends. Ann was\nparticularly delighted at meeting with agreeable society; a little\nhectic fever generally made her low-spirited in the morning, and lively\nin the evening, when she wished for company. Mary, who only thought of\nher, determined to cultivate their acquaintance, as she knew, that if\nher mind could be diverted, her body might gain strength.\n\nThey were all musical, and proposed having little concerts. One of the\ngentlemen played on the violin, and the other on the german-flute. The\ninstruments were brought in, with all the eagerness that attends putting\na new scheme in execution.\n\nMary had not said much, for she was diffident; she seldom joined in\ngeneral conversations; though her quickness of penetration enabled her\nsoon to enter into the characters of those she conversed with; and her\nsensibility made her desirous of pleasing every human creature. Besides,\nif her mind was not occupied by any particular sorrow, or study, she\ncaught reflected pleasure, and was glad to see others happy, though\ntheir mirth did not interest her.\n\nThis day she was continually thinking of Ann's recovery, and encouraging\nthe cheerful hopes, which though they dissipated the spirits that had\nbeen condensed by melancholy, yet made her wish to be silent. The music,\nmore than the conversation, disturbed her reflections; but not at first.\nThe gentleman who played on the german-flute, was a handsome, well-bred,\nsensible man; and his observations, if not original, were pertinent.\n\nThe other, who had not said much, began to touch the violin, and played\na little Scotch ballad; he brought such a thrilling sound out of the\ninstrument, that Mary started, and looking at him with more attention\nthan she had done before, and saw, in a face rather ugly, strong lines\nof genius. His manners were awkward, that kind of awkwardness which is\noften found in literary men: he seemed a thinker, and delivered his\nopinions in elegant expressions, and musical tones of voice.\n\nWhen the concert was over, they all retired to their apartments. Mary\nalways slept with Ann, as she was subject to terrifying dreams; and\nfrequently in the night was obliged to be supported, to avoid\nsuffocation. They chatted about their new acquaintance in their own\napartment, and, with respect to the gentlemen, differed in opinion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. X.\n\n\nEvery day almost they saw their new acquaintance; and civility produced\nintimacy. Mary sometimes left her friend with them; while she indulged\nherself in viewing new modes of life, and searching out the causes which\nproduced them. She had a metaphysical turn, which inclined her to\nreflect on every object that passed by her; and her mind was not like a\nmirror, which receives every floating image, but does not retain them:\nshe had not any prejudices, for every opinion was examined before it was\nadopted.\n\nThe Roman Catholic ceremonies attracted her attention, and gave rise to\nconversations when they all met; and one of the gentlemen continually\nintroduced deistical notions, when he ridiculed the pageantry they all\nwere surprised at observing. Mary thought of both the subjects, the\nRomish tenets, and the deistical doubts; and though not a sceptic,\nthought it right to examine the evidence on which her faith was built.\nShe read Butler's Analogy, and some other authors: and these researches\nmade her a christian from conviction, and she learned charity,\nparticularly with respect to sectaries; saw that apparently good and\nsolid arguments might take their rise from different points of view; and\nshe rejoiced to find that those she should not concur with had some\nreason on their side.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XI.\n\n\nWhen I mentioned the three ladies, I said they were fashionable women;\nand it was all the praise, as a faithful historian, I could bestow on\nthem; the only thing in which they were consistent. I forgot to mention\nthat they were all of one family, a mother, her daughter, and niece. The\ndaughter was sent by her physician, to avoid a northerly winter; the\nmother, her niece, and nephew, accompanied her.\n\nThey were people of rank; but unfortunately, though of an ancient\nfamily, the title had descended to a very remote branch--a branch they\ntook care to be intimate with; and servilely copied the Countess's\nairs. Their minds were shackled with a set of notions concerning\npropriety, the fitness of things for the world's eye, trammels which\nalways hamper weak people. What will the world say? was the first thing\nthat was thought of, when they intended doing any thing they had not\ndone before. Or what would the Countess do on such an occasion? And when\nthis question was answered, the right or wrong was discovered without\nthe trouble of their having any idea of the matter in their own heads.\nThis same Countess was a fine planet, and the satellites observed a most\nharmonic dance around her.\n\nAfter this account it is scarcely necessary to add, that their minds had\nreceived very little cultivation. They were taught French, Italian, and\nSpanish; English was their vulgar tongue. And what did they learn?\nHamlet will tell you--words--words. But let me not forget that they\nsqualled Italian songs in the true _gusto_. Without having any seeds\nsown in their understanding, or the affections of the heart set to work,\nthey were brought out of their nursery, or the place they were secluded\nin, to prevent their faces being common; like blazing stars, to\ncaptivate Lords.\n\nThey were pretty, and hurrying from one party of pleasure to another,\noccasioned the disorder which required change of air. The mother, if we\nexcept her being near twenty years older, was just the same creature;\nand these additional years only served to make her more tenaciously\nadhere to her habits of folly, and decide with stupid gravity, some\ntrivial points of ceremony, as a matter of the last importance; of\nwhich she was a competent judge, from having lived in the fashionable\nworld so long: that world to which the ignorant look up as we do to the\nsun.\n\nIt appears to me that every creature has some notion--or rather relish,\nof the sublime. Riches, and the consequent state, are the sublime of\nweak minds:--These images fill, nay, are too big for their narrow souls.\n\nOne afternoon, which they had engaged to spend together, Ann was so ill,\nthat Mary was obliged to send an apology for not attending the\ntea-table. The apology brought them on the carpet; and the mother, with\na look of solemn importance, turned to the sick man, whose name was\nHenry, and said;\n\n\"Though people of the first fashion are frequently at places of this\nkind, intimate with they know not who; yet I do not choose that my\ndaughter, whose family is so respectable, should be intimate with any\none she would blush to know elsewhere. It is only on that account, for I\nnever suffer her to be with any one but in my company,\" added she,\nsitting more erect; and a smile of self-complacency dressed her\ncountenance.\n\n\"I have enquired concerning these strangers, and find that the one who\nhas the most dignity in her manners, is really a woman of fortune.\"\n\"Lord, mamma, how ill she dresses:\" mamma went on; \"She is a romantic\ncreature, you must not copy her, miss; yet she is an heiress of the\nlarge fortune in ----shire, of which you may remember to have heard the\nCountess speak the night you had on the dancing-dress that was so much\nadmired; but she is married.\"\n\nShe then told them the whole story as she heard it from her maid, who\npicked it out of Mary's servant. \"She is a foolish creature, and this\nfriend that she pays as much attention to as if she was a lady of\nquality, is a beggar.\" \"Well, how strange!\" cried the girls.\n\n\"She is, however, a charming creature,\" said her nephew. Henry sighed,\nand strode across the room once or twice; then took up his violin, and\nplayed the air which first struck Mary; he had often heard her praise\nit.\n\nThe music was uncommonly melodious, \"And came stealing on the senses\nlike the sweet south.\" The well-known sounds reached Mary as she sat by\nher friend--she listened without knowing that she did--and shed tears\nalmost without being conscious of it. Ann soon fell asleep, as she had\ntaken an opiate. Mary, then brooding over her fears, began to imagine\nshe had deceived herself--Ann was still very ill; hope had beguiled many\nheavy hours; yet she was displeased with herself for admitting this\nwelcome guest.--And she worked up her mind to such a degree of anxiety,\nthat she determined, once more, to seek medical aid.\n\nNo sooner did she determine, than she ran down with a discomposed look,\nto enquire of the ladies who she should send for. When she entered the\nroom she could not articulate her fears--it appeared like pronouncing\nAnn's sentence of death; her faultering tongue dropped some broken\nwords, and she remained silent. The ladies wondered that a person of her\nsense should be so little mistress of herself; and began to administer\nsome common-place comfort, as, that it was our duty to submit to the\nwill of Heaven, and the like trite consolations, which Mary did not\nanswer; but waving her hand, with an air of impatience, she exclaimed,\n\"I cannot live without her!--I have no other friend; if I lose her, what\na desart will the world be to me.\" \"No other friend,\" re-echoed they,\n\"have you not a husband?\"\n\nMary shrunk back, and was alternately pale and red. A delicate sense of\npropriety prevented her replying; and recalled her bewildered\nreason.--Assuming, in consequence of her recollection, a more composed\nmanner, she made the intended enquiry, and left the room. Henry's eyes\nfollowed her while the females very freely animadverted on her strange\nbehaviour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XII.\n\n\nThe physician was sent for; his prescription afforded Ann a little\ntemporary relief; and they again joined the circle. Unfortunately, the\nweather happened to be constantly wet for more than a week, and confined\nthem to the house. Ann then found the ladies not so agreeable; when they\nsat whole hours together, the thread-bare topics were exhausted; and,\nbut for cards or music, the long evenings would have been yawned away in\nlistless indolence.\n\nThe bad weather had had as ill an effect on Henry as on Ann. He was\nfrequently very thoughtful, or rather melancholy; this melancholy would\nof itself have attracted Mary's notice, if she had not found his\nconversation so infinitely superior to the rest of the group. When she\nconversed with him, all the faculties of her soul unfolded themselves;\ngenius animated her expressive countenance and the most graceful,\nunaffected gestures gave energy to her discourse.\n\nThey frequently discussed very important subjects, while the rest were\nsinging or playing cards, nor were they observed for doing so, as Henry,\nwhom they all were pleased with, in the way of gallantry shewed them all\nmore attention than her. Besides, as there was nothing alluring in her\ndress or manner, they never dreamt of her being preferred to them.\n\nHenry was a man of learning; he had also studied mankind, and knew many\nof the intricacies of the human heart, from having felt the infirmities\nof his own. His taste was just, as it had a standard--Nature, which he\nobserved with a critical eye. Mary could not help thinking that in his\ncompany her mind expanded, as he always went below the surface. She\nincreased her stock of ideas, and her taste was improved.\n\nHe was also a pious man; his rational religious sentiments received\nwarmth from his sensibility; and, except on very particular occasions,\nkept it in proper bounds; these sentiments had likewise formed his\ntemper; he was gentle, and easily to be intreated. The ridiculous\nceremonies they were every day witness to, led them into what are termed\ngrave subjects, and made him explain his opinions, which, at other\ntimes, he was neither ashamed of, nor unnecessarily brought forward to\nnotice.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIII.\n\n\nWhen the weather began to clear up, Mary sometimes rode out alone,\npurposely to view the ruins that still remained of the earthquake: or\nshe would ride to the banks of the Tagus, to feast her eyes with the\nsight of that magnificent river. At other times she would visit the\nchurches, as she was particularly fond of seeing historical paintings.\n\nOne of these visits gave rise to the subject, and the whole party\ndescanted on it; but as the ladies could not handle it well, they soon\nadverted to portraits; and talked of the attitudes and characters in\nwhich they should wish to be drawn. Mary did not fix on one--when\nHenry, with more apparent warmth than usual, said, \"I would give the\nworld for your picture, with the expression I have seen in your face,\nwhen you have been supporting your friend.\"\n\nThis delicate compliment did not gratify her vanity, but it reached her\nheart. She then recollected that she had once sat for her picture--for\nwhom was it designed? For a boy! Her cheeks flushed with indignation, so\nstrongly did she feel an emotion of contempt at having been thrown\naway--given in with an estate.\n\nAs Mary again gave way to hope, her mind was more disengaged; and her\nthoughts were employed about the objects around her.\n\nShe visited several convents, and found that solitude only eradicates\nsome passions, to give strength to others; the most baneful ones. She\nsaw that religion does not consist in ceremonies; and that many prayers\nmay fall from the lips without purifying the heart.\n\nThey who imagine they can be religious without governing their tempers,\nor exercising benevolence in its most extensive sense, must certainly\nallow, that their religious duties are only practiced from selfish\nprinciples; how then can they be called good? The pattern of all\ngoodness went about _doing_ good. Wrapped up in themselves, the nuns\nonly thought of inferior gratifications. And a number of intrigues were\ncarried on to accelerate certain points on which their hearts were\nfixed:\n\nSuch as obtaining offices of trust or authority; or avoiding those that\nwere servile or laborious. In short, when they could be neither wives\nnor mothers, they aimed at being superiors, and became the most selfish\ncreatures in the world: the passions that were curbed gave strength to\nthe appetites, or to those mean passions which only tend to provide for\nthe gratification of them. Was this seclusion from the world? or did\nthey conquer its vanities or avoid its vexations?\n\nIn these abodes the unhappy individual, who, in the first paroxysm of\ngrief flies to them for refuge, finds too late she took a wrong step.\nThe same warmth which determined her will make her repent; and sorrow,\nthe rust of the mind, will never have a chance of being rubbed off by\nsensible conversation, or new-born affections of the heart.\n\nShe will find that those affections that have once been called forth and\nstrengthened by exercise, are only smothered, not killed, by\ndisappointment; and that in one form or other discontent will corrode\nthe heart, and produce those maladies of the imagination, for which\nthere is no specific.\n\nThe community at large Mary disliked; but pitied many of them whose\nprivate distresses she was informed of; and to pity and relieve were the\nsame things with her.\n\nThe exercise of her various virtues gave vigor to her genius, and\ndignity to her mind; she was sometimes inconsiderate, and violent; but\nnever mean or cunning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIV.\n\n\nThe Portuguese are certainly the most uncivilized nation in Europe. Dr.\nJohnson would have said, \"They have the least mind.\". And can such serve\ntheir Creator in spirit and in truth? No, the gross ritual of Romish\nceremonies is all they can comprehend: they can do penance, but not\nconquer their revenge, or lust. Religion, or love, has never humanized\ntheir hearts; they want the vital part; the mere body worships. Taste is\nunknown; Gothic finery, and unnatural decorations, which they term\nornaments, are conspicuous in their churches and dress. Reverence for\nmental excellence is only to be found in a polished nation.\n\nCould the contemplation of such a people gratify Mary's heart? No: she\nturned disgusted from the prospects--turned to a man of refinement.\nHenry had been some time ill and low-spirited; Mary would have been\nattentive to any one in that situation; but to him she was particularly\nso; she thought herself bound in gratitude, on account of his constant\nendeavours to amuse Ann, and prevent her dwelling on the dreary prospect\nbefore her, which sometimes she could not help anticipating with a kind\nof quiet despair.\n\nShe found some excuse for going more frequently into the room they all\nmet in; nay, she avowed her desire to amuse him: offered to read to him,\nand tried to draw him into amusing conversations; and when she was full\nof these little schemes, she looked at him with a degree of tenderness\nthat she was not conscious of. This divided attention was of use to her,\nand prevented her continually thinking of Ann, whose fluctuating\ndisorder often gave rise to false hopes.\n\nA trifling thing occurred now which occasioned Mary some uneasiness. Her\nmaid, a well-looking girl, had captivated the clerk of a neighbouring\ncompting-house. As the match was an advantageous one, Mary could not\nraise any objection to it, though at this juncture it was very\ndisagreeable to her to have a stranger about her person. However, the\ngirl consented to delay the marriage, as she had some affection for her\nmistress; and, besides, looked forward to Ann's death as a time of\nharvest.\n\nHenry's illness was not alarming, it was rather pleasing, as it gave\nMary an excuse to herself for shewing him how much she was interested\nabout him; and giving little artless proofs of affection, which the\npurity of her heart made her never wish to restrain.\n\nThe only visible return he made was not obvious to common observers. He\nwould sometimes fix his eyes on her, and take them off with a sigh that\nwas coughed away; or when he was leisurely walking into the room, and\ndid not expect to see her, he would quicken his steps, and come up to\nher with eagerness to ask some trivial question. In the same style, he\nwould try to detain her when he had nothing to say--or said nothing.\n\nAnn did not take notice of either his or Mary's behaviour, nor did she\nsuspect that he was a favourite, on any other account than his\nappearing neither well nor happy. She had often seen that when a person\nwas unfortunate, Mary's pity might easily be mistaken for love, and,\nindeed, it was a temporary sensation of that kind. Such it was--why it\nwas so, let others define, I cannot argue against instincts. As reason\nis cultivated in man, they are supposed to grow weaker, and this may\nhave given rise to the assertion, \"That as judgment improves, genius\nevaporates.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XV.\n\n\nOne morning they set out to visit the aqueduct; though the day was very\nfine when they left home, a very heavy shower fell before they reached\nit; they lengthened their ride, the clouds dispersed, and the sun came\nfrom behind them uncommonly bright.\n\nMary would fain have persuaded Ann not to have left the carriage; but\nshe was in spirits, and obviated all her objections, and insisted on\nwalking, tho' the ground was damp. But her strength was not equal to her\nspirits; she was soon obliged to return to the carriage so much\nfatigued, that she fainted, and remained insensible a long time.\n\nHenry would have supported her; but Mary would not permit him; her\nrecollection was instantaneous, and she feared sitting on the damp\nground might do him a material injury: she was on that account positive,\nthough the company did not guess the cause of her being so. As to\nherself, she did not fear bodily pain; and, when her mind was agitated,\nshe could endure the greatest fatigue without appearing sensible of it.\n\nWhen Ann recovered, they returned slowly home; she was carried to bed,\nand the next morning Mary thought she observed a visible change for the\nworse. The physician was sent for, who pronounced her to be in the most\nimminent danger.\n\nAll Mary's former fears now returned like a torrent, and carried every\nother care away; she even added to her present anguish by upbraiding\nherself for her late tranquillity--it haunted her in the form of a\ncrime.\n\nThe disorder made the most rapid advances--there was no hope!--Bereft of\nit, Mary again was tranquil; but it was a very different kind of\ntranquillity. She stood to brave the approaching storm, conscious she\nonly could be overwhelmed by it.\n\nShe did not think of Henry, or if her thoughts glanced towards him, it\nwas only to find fault with herself for suffering a thought to have\nstrayed from Ann.--Ann!--this dear friend was soon torn from her--she\ndied suddenly as Mary was assisting her to walk across the room.--The\nfirst string was severed from her heart--and this \"slow, sudden-death\"\ndisturbed her reasoning faculties; she seemed stunned by it; unable to\nreflect, or even to feel her misery.\n\nThe body was stolen out of the house the second night, and Mary refused\nto see her former companions. She desired her maid to conclude her\nmarriage, and request her intended husband to inform her when the first\nmerchantman was to leave the port, as the packet had just sailed, and\nshe determined not to stay in that hated place any longer than was\nabsolutely necessary.\n\nShe then sent to request the ladies to visit her; she wished to avoid a\nparade of grief--her sorrows were her own, and appeared to her not to\nadmit of increase or softening. She was right; the sight of them did not\naffect her, or turn the stream of her sullen sorrow; the black wave\nrolled along in the same course, it was equal to her where she cast her\neyes; all was impenetrable gloom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVI.\n\n\nSoon after the ladies left her, she received a message from Henry,\nrequesting, as she saw company, to be permitted to visit her: she\nconsented, and he entered immediately, with an unassured pace. She ran\neagerly up to him--saw the tear trembling in his eye, and his\ncountenance softened by the tenderest compassion; the hand which pressed\nhers seemed that of a fellow-creature. She burst into tears; and, unable\nto restrain them, she hid her face with both her hands; these tears\nrelieved her, (she had before had a difficulty in breathing,) and she\nsat down by him more composed than she had appeared since Ann's death;\nbut her conversation was incoherent.\n\nShe called herself \"a poor disconsolate creature!\"--\"Mine is a selfish\ngrief,\" she exclaimed--\"Yet; Heaven is my witness, I do not wish her\nback now she has reached those peaceful mansions, where the weary rest.\nHer pure spirit is happy; but what a wretch am I!\"\n\nHenry forgot his cautious reserve. \"Would you allow me to call you\nfriend?\" said he in a hesitating voice. \"I feel, dear girl, the tendered\ninterest in whatever concerns thee.\" His eyes spoke the rest. They were\nboth silent a few moments; then Henry resumed the conversation. \"I have\nalso been acquainted with grief! I mourn the loss of a woman who was not\nworthy of my regard. Let me give thee some account of the man who now\nsolicits thy friendship; and who, from motives of the purest\nbenevolence, wishes to give comfort to thy wounded heart.\"\n\n\"I have myself,\" said he, mournfully, \"shaken hands with happiness, and\nam dead to the world; I wait patiently for my dissolution; but, for\nthee, Mary, there may be many bright days in store.\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" replied she, in a peevish tone, as if he had insulted her\nby the supposition; her feelings were so much in unison with his, that\nshe was in love with misery.\n\nHe smiled at her impatience, and went on. \"My father died before I knew\nhim, and my mother was so attached to my eldest brother, that she took\nvery little pains to fit me for the profession to which I was destined:\nand, may I tell thee, I left my family, and, in many different stations,\nrambled about the world; saw mankind in every rank of life; and, in\norder to be independent, exerted those talents Nature has given me:\nthese exertions improved my understanding; and the miseries I was\nwitness to, gave a keener edge to my sensibility. My constitution is\nnaturally weak; and, perhaps, two or three lingering disorders in my\nyouth, first gave me a habit of reflecting, and enabled me to obtain\nsome dominion over my passions. At least,\" added he, stifling a sigh,\n\"over the violent ones, though I fear, refinement and reflection only\nrenders the tender ones more tyrannic.\n\n\"I have told you already I have been in love, and disappointed--the\nobject is now no more; let her faults sleep with her! Yet this passion\nhas pervaded my whole soul, and mixed itself with all my affections and\npursuits.--I am not peacefully indifferent; yet it is only to my violin\nI tell the sorrows I now confide with thee. The object I loved forfeited\nmy esteem; yet, true to the sentiment, my fancy has too frequently\ndelighted to form a creature that I could love, that could convey to my\nsoul sensations which the gross part of mankind have not any conception\nof.\"\n\nHe stopped, as Mary seemed lost in thought; but as she was still in a\nlistening attitude, continued his little narrative. \"I kept up an\nirregular correspondence with my mother; my brother's extravagance and\ningratitude had almost broken her heart, and made her feel something\nlike a pang of remorse, on account of her behaviour to me. I hastened to\ncomfort her--and was a comfort to her.\n\n\"My declining health prevented my taking orders, as I had intended; but\nI with warmth entered into literary pursuits; perhaps my heart, not\nhaving an object, made me embrace the substitute with more eagerness.\nBut, do not imagine I have always been a die-away swain. No: I have\nfrequented the cheerful haunts of men, and wit!--enchanting wit! has\nmade many moments fly free from care. I am too fond of the elegant arts;\nand woman--lovely woman! thou hast charmed me, though, perhaps, it would\nnot be easy to find one to whom my reason would allow me to be constant.\n\n\"I have now only to tell you, that my mother insisted on my spending\nthis winter in a warmer climate; and I fixed on Lisbon, as I had before\nvisited the Continent.\" He then looked Mary full in the face; and, with\nthe most insinuating accents, asked \"if he might hope for her\nfriendship? If she would rely on him as if he was her father; and that\nthe tenderest father could not more anxiously interest himself in the\nfate of a darling child, than he did in her's.\"\n\nSuch a crowd of thoughts all at once rushed into Mary's mind, that she\nin vain attempted to express the sentiments which were most predominant.\nHer heart longed to receive a new guest; there was a void in it:\naccustomed to have some one to love, she was alone, and comfortless, if\nnot engrossed by a particular affection.\n\nHenry saw her distress, and not to increase it, left the room. He had\nexerted himself to turn her thoughts into a new channel, and had\nsucceeded; she thought of him till she began to chide herself for\ndefrauding the dead, and, determining to grieve for Ann, she dwelt on\nHenry's misfortunes and ill health; and the interest he took in her fate\nwas a balm to her sick mind. She did not reason on the subject; but she\nfelt he was attached to her: lost in this delirium, she never asked\nherself what kind of an affection she had for him, or what it tended to;\nnor did she know that love and friendship are very distinct; she thought\nwith rapture, that there was one person in the world who had an\naffection for her, and that person she admired--had a friendship for.\n\nHe had called her his dear girl; the words might have fallen from him by\naccident; but they did not fall to the ground. My child! His child,\nwhat an association of ideas! If I had had a father, such a father!--She\ncould not dwell on the thoughts, the wishes which obtruded themselves.\nHer mind was unhinged, and passion unperceived filled her whole soul.\nLost, in waking dreams, she considered and reconsidered Henry's account\nof himself; till she actually thought she would tell Ann--a bitter\nrecollection then roused her out of her reverie; and aloud she begged\nforgiveness of her.\n\nBy these kind of conflicts the day was lengthened; and when she went to\nbed, the night passed away in feverish slumbers; though they did not\nrefresh her, she was spared the labour of thinking, of restraining her\nimagination; it sported uncontrouled; but took its colour from her\nwaking train of thoughts. One instant she was supporting her dying\nmother; then Ann was breathing her last, and Henry was comforting her.\n\nThe unwelcome light visited her languid eyes; yet, I must tell the\ntruth, she thought she should see Henry, and this hope set her spirits\nin motion: but they were quickly depressed by her maid, who came to tell\nher that she had heard of a vessel on board of which she could be\naccommodated, and that there was to be another female passenger on\nboard, a vulgar one; but perhaps she would be more useful on that\naccount--Mary did not want a companion.\n\nAs she had given orders for her passage to be engaged in the first\nvessel that sailed, she could not now retract; and must prepare for the\nlonely voyage, as the Captain intended taking advantage of the first\nfair wind. She had too much strength of mind to waver in her\ndetermination but to determine wrung her very heart, opened all her old\nwounds, and made them bleed afresh. What was she to do? where go? Could\nshe set a seal to a hasty vow, and tell a deliberate lie; promise to\nlove one man, when the image of another was ever present to her--her\nsoul revolted. \"I might gain the applause of the world by such mock\nheroism; but should I not forfeit my own? forfeit thine, my father!\"\n\nThere is a solemnity in the shortest ejaculation, which, for a while,\nstills the tumult of passion. Mary's mind had been thrown off its poise;\nher devotion had been, perhaps, more fervent for some time past; but\nless regular. She forgot that happiness was not to be found on earth,\nand built a terrestrial paradise liable to be destroyed by the first\nserious thought: when, she reasoned she became inexpressibly sad, to\nrender life bearable she gave way to fancy--this was madness.\n\nIn a few days she must again go to sea; the weather was very\ntempestuous--what of that, the tempest in her soul rendered every other\ntrifling--it was not the contending elements, but _herself_ she feared!\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVII.\n\n\nIn order to gain strength to support the expected interview, she went\nout in a carriage. The day was fine; but all nature was to her a\nuniversal blank; she could neither enjoy it, nor weep that she could\nnot. She passed by the ruins of an old monastery on a very high hill she\ngot out to walk amongst the ruins; the wind blew violently, she did not\navoid its fury, on the contrary, wildly bid it blow on, and seemed glad\nto contend with it, or rather walk against it. Exhausted she returned to\nthe carriage was soon at home, and in the old room.\n\nHenry started at the sight of her altered appearance; the day before her\ncomplexion had been of the most pallid hue; but now her cheeks were\nflushed, and her eyes enlivened with a false vivacity, an unusual fire.\nHe was not well, his illness was apparent in his countenance, and he\nowned he had not closed his eyes all night; this roused her dormant\ntenderness, she forgot they were so soon to part-engrossed by the\npresent happiness of seeing, of hearing him.\n\nOnce or twice she essayed to tell him that she was, in a few days, to\ndepart; but she could not; she was irresolute; it will do to-morrow;\nshould the wind change they could not sail in such a hurry; thus she\nthought, and insensibly grew more calm. The Ladies prevailed on her to\nspend the evening with them; but she retired very early to rest, and sat\non the side of her bed several hours, then threw herself on it, and\nwaited for the dreaded to-morrow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVIII.\n\n\nThe ladies heard that her servant was to be married that day, and that\nshe was to sail in the vessel which was then clearing out at the\nCustom-house. Henry heard, but did not make any remarks; and Mary called\nup all her fortitude to support her, and enable her to hide from the\nfemales her internal struggles. She durst not encounter Henry's glances\nwhen she found he had been informed of her intention; and, trying to\ndraw a veil over her wretched state of mind, she talked incessantly, she\nknew not what; flashes of wit burst from her, and when she began to\nlaugh she could not stop herself.\n\nHenry smiled at some of her sallies, and looked at her with such\nbenignity and compassion, that he recalled her scattered thoughts; and,\nthe ladies going to dress for dinner, they were left alone; and remained\nsilent a few moments: after the noisy conversation it appeared solemn.\nHenry began. \"You are going, Mary, and going by yourself; your mind is\nnot in a state to be left to its own operations--yet I cannot, dissuade\nyou; if I attempted to do it, I should ill deserve the title I wish to\nmerit. I only think of your happiness; could I obey the strongest\nimpulse of my heart, I should accompany thee to England; but such a step\nmight endanger your future peace.\"\n\nMary, then, with all the frankness which marked her character, explained\nher situation to him and mentioned her fatal tie with such disgust that\nhe trembled for her. \"I cannot see him; he is not the man formed for me\nto love!\" Her delicacy did not restrain her, for her dislike to her\nhusband had taken root in her mind long before she knew Henry. Did she\nnot fix on Lisbon rather than France on purpose to avoid him? and if Ann\nhad been in tolerable health she would have flown with her to some\nremote corner to have escaped from him.\n\n\"I intend,\" said Henry, \"to follow you in the next packet; where shall I\nhear of your health?\" \"Oh! let me hear of thine,\" replied Mary. \"I am\nwell, very well; but thou art very ill--thy health is in the most\nprecarious state.\" She then mentioned her intention of going to Ann's\nrelations. \"I am her representative, I have duties to fulfil for her:\nduring my voyage I have time enough for reflection; though I think I\nhave already determined.\"\n\n\"Be not too hasty, my child,\" interrupted Henry; \"far be it from me to\npersuade thee to do violence to thy feelings--but consider that all thy\nfuture life may probably take its colour from thy present mode of\nconduct. Our affections as well as our sentiments are fluctuating; you\nwill not perhaps always either think or feel as you do at present: the\nobject you now shun may appear in a different light.\" He paused. \"In\nadvising thee in this style, I have only thy good at heart, Mary.\"\n\nShe only answered to expostulate. \"My affections are involuntary--yet\nthey can only be fixed by reflection, and when they are they make quite\na part of my soul, are interwoven in it, animate my actions, and form\nmy taste: certain qualities are calculated to call forth my sympathies,\nand make me all I am capable of being. The governing affection gives its\nstamp to the rest--because I am capable of loving one, I have that kind\nof charity to all my fellow-creatures which is not easily provoked.\nMilton has asserted, That earthly love is the scale by which to heavenly\nwe may ascend.\"\n\nShe went on with eagerness. \"My opinions on some subjects are not\nwavering; my pursuit through life has ever been the same: in solitude\nwere my sentiments formed; they are indelible, and nothing can efface\nthem but death--No, death itself cannot efface them, or my soul must be\ncreated afresh, and not improved. Yet a little while am I parted from\nmy Ann--I could not exist without the hope of seeing her again--I could\nnot bear to think that time could wear away an affection that was\nfounded on what is not liable to perish; you might as well attempt to\npersuade me that my soul is matter, and that its feelings arose from\ncertain modifications of it.\"\n\n\"Dear enthusiastic creature,\" whispered Henry, \"how you steal into my\nsoul.\" She still continued. \"The same turn of mind which leads me to\nadore the Author of all Perfection--which leads me to conclude that he\nonly can fill my soul; forces me to admire the faint image-the shadows\nof his attributes here below; and my imagination gives still bolder\nstrokes to them. I knew I am in some degree under the influence of a\ndelusion--but does not this strong delusion prove that I myself 'am _of\nsubtiler essence than the trodden clod_' these flights of the\nimagination point to futurity; I cannot banish them. Every cause in\nnature produces an effect; and am I an exception to the general rule?\nhave I desires implanted in me only to make me miserable? will they\nnever be gratified? shall I never be happy? My feelings do not accord\nwith the notion of solitary happiness. In a state of bliss, it will be\nthe society of beings we can love, without the alloy that earthly\ninfirmities mix with our best affections, that will constitute great\npart of our happiness.\n\n\"With these notions can I conform to the maxims of worldly wisdom? can\nI listen to the cold dictates of worldly prudence and bid my tumultuous\npassions cease to vex me, be still, find content in grovelling pursuits,\nand the admiration of the misjudging crowd, when it is only one I wish\nto please--one who could be all the world to me. Argue not with me, I am\nbound by human ties; but did my spirit ever promise to love, or could I\nconsider when forced to bind myself--to take a vow, that at the awful\nday of judgment I must give an account of. My conscience does not smite\nme, and that Being who is greater than the internal monitor, may approve\nof what the world condemns; sensible that in Him I live, could I brave\nHis presence, or hope in solitude to find peace, if I acted contrary to\nconviction, that the world might approve of my conduct--what could the\nworld give to compensate for my own esteem? it is ever hostile and armed\nagainst the feeling heart!\n\n\"Riches and honours await me, and the cold moralist might desire me to\nsit down and enjoy them--I cannot conquer my feelings, and till I do,\nwhat are these baubles to me? you may tell me I follow a fleeting good,\nan _ignis fatuus_; but this chase, these struggles prepare me for\neternity--when I no longer see through a glass darkly I shall not reason\nabout, but _feel_ in what happiness consists.\"\n\nHenry had not attempted to interrupt her; he saw she was determined, and\nthat these sentiments were not the effusion of the moment, but well\ndigested ones, the result of strong affections, a high sense of honour,\nand respect for the source of all virtue and truth. He was startled, if\nnot entirely convinced by her arguments; indeed her voice, her gestures\nwere all persuasive.\n\nSome one now entered the room; he looked an answer to her long harangue;\nit was fortunate for him, or he might have been led to say what in a\ncooler moment he had determined to conceal; but were words necessary to\nreveal it? He wished not to influence her conduct--vain precaution; she\nknew she was beloved; and could she forget that such a man loved her, or\nrest satisfied with any inferior gratification. When passion first\nenters the heart, it is only a return of affection that is sought after,\nand every other remembrance and wish is blotted out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIX.\n\n\nTwo days passed away without any particular conversation; Henry, trying\nto be indifferent, or to appear so, was more assiduous than ever. The\nconflict was too violent for his present state of health; the spirit was\nwilling, but the body suffered; he lost his appetite, and looked\nwretchedly; his spirits were calmly low--the world seemed to fade\naway--what was that world to him that Mary did not inhabit; she lived\nnot for him.\n\nHe was mistaken; his affection was her only support; without this dear\nprop she had sunk into the grave of her lost--long-loved friend;--his\nattention snatched her from despair. Inscrutable are the ways of\nHeaven!\n\nThe third day Mary was desired to prepare herself; for if the wind\ncontinued in the same point, they should set sail the next evening. She\ntried to prepare her mind, and her efforts were not useless she appeared\nless agitated than could have been expected, and talked of her voyage\nwith composure. On great occasions she was generally calm and collected,\nher resolution would brace her unstrung nerves; but after the victory\nshe had no triumph; she would sink into a state of moping melancholy,\nand feel ten-fold misery when the heroic enthusiasm was over.\n\nThe morning of the day fixed on for her departure she was alone with\nHenry only a few moments, and an awkward kind of formality made them\nslip away without their having said much to each other. Henry was\nafraid to discover his passion, or give any other name to his regard but\nfriendship; yet his anxious solicitude for her welfare was ever breaking\nout-while she as artlessly expressed again and again, her fears with\nrespect to his declining health.\n\n\"We shall soon meet,\" said he, with a faint smile; Mary smiled too; she\ncaught the sickly beam; it was still fainter by being reflected, and not\nknowing what she wished to do, started up and left the room. When she\nwas alone she regretted she had left him so precipitately. \"The few\nprecious moments I have thus thrown away may never return,\" she\nthought-the reflection led to misery.\n\nShe waited for, nay, almost wished for the summons to depart. She could\nnot avoid spending the intermediate time with the ladies and Henry; and\nthe trivial conversations she was obliged to bear a part in harassed her\nmore than can be well conceived.\n\nThe summons came, and the whole party attended her to the vessel. For a\nwhile the remembrance of Ann banished her regret at parting with Henry,\nthough his pale figure pressed on her sight; it may seem a paradox, but\nhe was more present to her when she sailed; her tears then were all his\nown.\n\n\"My poor Ann!\" thought Mary, \"along this road we came, and near this\nspot you called me your guardian angel--and now I leave thee here! ah!\nno, I do not--thy spirit is not confined to its mouldering tenement!\nTell me, thou soul of her I love, tell me, ah! whither art thou fled?\"\nAnn occupied her until they reached the ship.\n\nThe anchor was weighed. Nothing can be more irksome than waiting to say\nfarewel. As the day was serene, they accompanied her a little way, and\nthen got into the boat; Henry was the last; he pressed her hand, it had\nnot any life in it; she leaned over the side of the ship without looking\nat the boat, till it was so far distant, that she could not see the\ncountenances of those that were in it: a mist spread itself over her\nsight--she longed to exchange one look--tried to recollect the\nlast;--the universe contained no being but Henry!--The grief of parting\nwith him had swept all others clean away. Her eyes followed the keel of\nthe boat, and when she could no longer perceive its traces: she looked\nround on the wide waste of waters, thought of the precious moments\nwhich had been stolen from the waste of murdered time.\n\nShe then descended into the cabin, regardless of the surrounding\nbeauties of nature, and throwing herself on her bed in the little hole\nwhich was called the state-room--she wished to forget her existence. On\nthis bed she remained two days, listening to the dashing waves, unable\nto close her eyes. A small taper made the darkness visible; and the\nthird night, by its glimmering light, she wrote the following fragment.\n\n\"Poor solitary wretch that I am; here alone do I listen to the whistling\nwinds and dashing waves;--on no human support can I rest--when not lost\nto hope I found pleasure in the society of those rough beings; but now\nthey appear not like my fellow creatures; no social ties draw me to\nthem. How long, how dreary has this day been; yet I scarcely wish it\nover--for what will to-morrow bring--to-morrow, and to-morrow will only\nbe marked with unvaried characters of wretchedness.--Yet surely, I am\nnot alone!\"\n\nHer moistened eyes were lifted up to heaven; a crowd of thoughts darted\ninto her mind, and pressing her hand against her forehead, as if to bear\nthe intellectual weight, she tried, but tried in vain, to arrange them.\n\"Father of Mercies, compose this troubled spirit: do I indeed wish it to\nbe composed--to forget my Henry?\" the _my_, the pen was directly drawn\nacross in an agony.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XX.\n\n\nThe mate of the ship, who heard her stir, came to offer her some\nrefreshment; and she, who formerly received every offer of kindness or\ncivility with pleasure, now shrunk away disgusted: peevishly she desired\nhim not to disturb her; but the words were hardly articulated when her\nheart smote her, she called him back, and requested something to drink.\nAfter drinking it, fatigued by her mental exertions, she fell into a\ndeath-like slumber, which lasted some hours; but did not refresh her, on\nthe contrary, she awoke languid and stupid.\n\nThe wind still continued contrary; a week, a dismal week, had she\nstruggled with her sorrows; and the struggle brought on a slow fever,\nwhich sometimes gave her false spirits.\n\nThe winds then became very tempestuous, the Great Deep was troubled, and\nall the passengers appalled. Mary then left her bed, and went on deck,\nto survey the contending elements: the scene accorded with the present\nstate of her soul; she thought in a few hours I may go home; the\nprisoner may be released. The vessel rose on a wave and descended into a\nyawning gulph--Not slower did her mounting soul return to earth,\nfor--Ah! her treasure and her heart was there. The squalls rattled\namongst the sails, which were quickly taken down; the wind would then\ndie away, and the wild undirected waves rushed on every side with a\ntremendous roar. In a little vessel in the midst of such a storm she\nwas not dismayed; she felt herself independent.\n\nJust then one of the crew perceived a signal of distress; by the help of\na glass he could plainly discover a small vessel dismasted, drifted\nabout, for the rudder had been broken by the violence of the storm.\nMary's thoughts were now all engrossed by the crew on the brink of\ndestruction. They bore down to the wreck; they reached it, and hailed\nthe trembling wretches; at the sound of the friendly greeting, loud\ncries of tumultuous joy were mixed with the roaring of the waves, and\nwith ecstatic transport they leaped on the shattered deck, launched\ntheir boat in a moment, and committed themselves to the mercy of the\nsea. Stowed between two casks, and leaning on a sail, she watched the\nboat, and when a wave intercepted it from her view--she ceased to\nbreathe, or rather held her breath until it rose again.\n\nAt last the boat arrived safe along-side the ship, and Mary caught the\npoor trembling wretches as they stumbled into it, and joined them in\nthanking that gracious Being, who though He had not thought fit to still\nthe raging of the sea, had afforded them unexpected succour.\n\nAmongst the wretched crew was one poor woman, who fainted when she was\nhauled on board: Mary undressed her, and when she had recovered, and\nsoothed her, left her to enjoy the rest she required to recruit her\nstrength, which fear had quite exhausted. She returned again to view the\nangry deep; and when she gazed on its perturbed state, she thought of\nthe Being who rode on the wings of the wind, and stilled the noise of\nthe sea; and the madness of the people--He only could speak peace to\nher troubled spirit! she grew more calm; the late transaction had\ngratified her benevolence, and stole her out of herself.\n\nOne of the sailors, happening to say to another, \"that he believed the\nworld was going to be at an end;\" this observation led her into a new\ntrain of thoughts: some of Handel's sublime compositions occurred to\nher, and she sung them to the grand accompaniment. The Lord God\nOmnipotent reigned, and would reign for ever, and ever!--Why then did\nshe fear the sorrows that were passing away, when she knew that He would\nbind up the broken-hearted, and receive those who came out of great\ntribulation. She retired to her cabin; and wrote in the little book that\nwas now her only confident. It was after midnight.\n\n\"At this solemn hour, the great day of judgment fills my thoughts; the\nday of retribution, when the secrets of all hearts will be revealed;\nwhen all worldly distinctions will fade away, and be no more seen. I\nhave not words to express the sublime images which the bare\ncontemplation of this awful day raises in my mind. Then, indeed, the\nLord Omnipotent will reign, and He will wipe the tearful eye, and\nsupport the trembling heart--yet a little while He hideth his face, and\nthe dun shades of sorrow, and the thick clouds of folly separate us from\nour God; but when the glad dawn of an eternal day breaks, we shall know\neven as we are known. Here we walk by faith, and not by sight; and we\nhave this alternative, either to enjoy the pleasures of life which are\nbut for a season, or look forward to the prize of our high calling, and\nwith fortitude, and that wisdom which is from above, endeavour to bear\nthe warfare of life. We know that many run the race; but he that\nstriveth obtaineth the crown of victory. Our race is an arduous one! How\nmany are betrayed by traitors lodged in their own breasts, who wear the\ngarb of Virtue, and are so near akin; we sigh to think they should ever\nlead into folly, and slide imperceptibly into vice. Surely any thing\nlike happiness is madness! Shall probationers of an hour presume to\npluck the fruit of immortality, before they have conquered death? it is\nguarded, when the great day, to which I allude, arrives, the way will\nagain be opened. Ye dear delusions, gay deceits, farewel! and yet I\ncannot banish ye for ever; still does my panting soul push forward, and\nlive in futurity, in the deep shades o'er which darkness hangs.--I try\nto pierce the gloom, and find a resting-place, where my thirst of\nknowledge will be gratified, and my ardent affections find an object to\nfix them. Every thing material must change; happiness and this\nfluctating principle is not compatible. Eternity, immateriality, and\nhappiness,--what are ye? How shall I grasp the mighty and fleeting\nconceptions ye create?\"\n\nAfter writing, serenely she delivered her soul into the hands of the\nFather of Spirits; and slept in peace.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXI.\n\n\nMary rose early, refreshed by the seasonable rest, and went to visit the\npoor woman, whom she found quite recovered: and, on enquiry, heard that\nshe had lately buried her husband, a common sailor; and that her only\nsurviving child had been washed over-board the day before. Full of her\nown danger, she scarcely thought of her child till that was over; and\nthen she gave way to boisterous emotions.\n\nMary endeavoured to calm her at first, by sympathizing with her; and she\ntried to point out the only solid source of comfort but in doing this\nshe encountered many difficulties; she found her grossly ignorant, yet\nshe did not despair: and as the poor creature could not receive comfort\nfrom the operations of her own mind, she laboured to beguile the hours,\nwhich grief made heavy, by adapting her conversation to her capacity.\n\nThere are many minds that only receive impressions through the medium of\nthe senses: to them did Mary address herself; she made her some\npresents, and promised to assist her when they should arrive in England.\nThis employment roused her out of her late stupor, and again set the\nfaculties of her soul in motion; made the understanding contend with the\nimagination, and the heart throbbed not so irregularly during the\ncontention. How short-lived was the calm! when the English coast was\ndescried, her sorrows returned with redoubled vigor.--She was to visit\nand comfort the mother of her lost friend--And where then should she\ntake up her residence? These thoughts suspended the exertions of her\nunderstanding; abstracted reflections gave way to alarming\napprehensions; and tenderness undermined fortitude.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXII.\n\n\nIn England then landed the forlorn wanderer. She looked round for some\nfew moments--her affections were not attracted to any particular part of\nthe Island. She knew none of the inhabitants of the vast city to which\nshe was going: the mass of buildings appeared to her a huge body without\nan informing soul. As she passed through the streets in an\nhackney-coach, disgust and horror alternately filled her mind. She met\nsome women drunk; and the manners of those who attacked the sailors,\nmade her shrink into herself, and exclaim, are these my fellow\ncreatures!\n\nDetained by a number of carts near the water-side, for she came up the\nriver in the vessel, not having reason to hasten on shore, she saw\nvulgarity, dirt, and vice--her soul sickened; this was the first time\nsuch complicated misery obtruded itself on her sight.--Forgetting her\nown griefs, she gave the world a much indebted tear; mourned for a world\nin ruins. She then perceived, that great part of her comfort must arise\nfrom viewing the smiling face of nature, and be reflected from the view\nof innocent enjoyments: she was fond of seeing animals play, and could\nnot bear to see her own species sink below them.\n\nIn a little dwelling in one of the villages near London, lived the\nmother of Ann; two of her children still remained with her; but they did\nnot resemble Ann. To her house Mary directed the coach, and told the\nunfortunate mother of her loss. The poor woman, oppressed by it, and her\nmany other cares, after an inundation of tears, began to enumerate all\nher past misfortunes, and present cares. The heavy tale lasted until\nmidnight, and the impression it made on Mary's mind was so strong, that\nit banished sleep till towards morning; when tired nature sought\nforgetfulness, and the soul ceased to ruminate about many things.\n\nShe sent for the poor woman they took up at sea, provided her a lodging,\nand relieved her present necessities. A few days were spent in a kind of\nlistless way; then the mother of Ann began to enquire when she thought\nof returning home. She had hitherto treated her with the greatest\nrespect, and concealed her wonder at Mary's choosing a remote room in\nthe house near the garden, and ordering some alterations to be made, as\nif she intended living in it.\n\nMary did not choose to explain herself; had Ann lived, it is probable\nshe would never have loved Henry so fondly; but if she had, she could\nnot have talked of her passion to any human creature. She deliberated,\nand at last informed the family, that she had a reason for not living\nwith her husband, which must some time remain a secret--they stared--Not\nlive with him! how will you live then? This was a question she could not\nanswer; she had only about eighty pounds remaining, of the money she\ntook with her to Lisbon; when it was exhausted where could she get more?\nI will work, she cried, do any thing rather than be a slave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIII.\n\n\nUnhappy, she wandered about the village, and relieved the poor; it was\nthe only employment that eased her aching heart; she became more\nintimate with misery--the misery that rises from poverty and the want of\neducation. She was in the vicinity of a great city; the vicious poor in\nand about it must ever grieve a benevolent contemplative mind.\n\nOne evening a man who stood weeping in a little lane, near the house she\nresided in, caught her eye. She accosted him; in a confused manner, he\ninformed her, that his wife was dying, and his children crying for the\nbread he could not earn. Mary desired to be conducted to his\nhabitation; it was not very distant, and was the upper room in an old\nmansion-house, which had been once the abode of luxury. Some tattered\nshreds of rich hangings still remained, covered with cobwebs and filth;\nround the ceiling, through which the rain drop'd, was a beautiful\ncornice mouldering; and a spacious gallery was rendered dark by the\nbroken windows being blocked up; through the apertures the wind forced\nits way in hollow sounds, and reverberated along the former scene of\nfestivity.\n\nIt was crowded with inhabitants: som were scolding, others swearing, or\nsinging indecent songs. What a sight for Mary! Her blood ran cold; yet\nshe had sufficient resolution to mount to the top of the house. On the\nfloor, in one corner of a very small room, lay an emaciated figure of a\nwoman; a window over her head scarcely admitted any light, for the\nbroken panes were stuffed with dirty rags. Near her were five children,\nall young, and covered with dirt; their sallow cheeks, and languid eyes,\nexhibited none of the charms of childhood. Some were fighting, and\nothers crying for food; their yells were mixed with their mother's\ngroans, and the wind which rushed through the passage. Mary was\npetrified; but soon assuming more courage, approached the bed, and,\nregardless of the surrounding nastiness, knelt down by the poor wretch,\nand breathed the most poisonous air; for the unfortunate creature was\ndying of a putrid fever, the consequence of dirt and want.\n\nTheir state did not require much explanation. Mary sent the husband for\na poor neighbour, whom she hired to nurse the woman, and take care of\nthe children; and then went herself to buy them some necessaries at a\nshop not far distant. Her knowledge of physic had enabled her to\nprescribe for the woman; and she left the house, with a mixture of\nhorror and satisfaction.\n\nShe visited them every day, and procured them every comfort; contrary to\nher expectation, the woman began to recover; cleanliness and wholesome\nfood had a wonderful effect; and Mary saw her rising as it were from the\ngrave. Not aware of the danger she ran into, she did not think of it\ntill she perceived she had caught the fever. It made such an alarming\nprogress, that she was prevailed on to send for a physician; but the\ndisorder was so violent, that for some days it baffled his skill; and\nMary felt not her danger, as she was delirious. After the crisis, the\nsymptoms were more favourable, and she slowly recovered, without\nregaining much strength or spirits; indeed they were intolerably low:\nshe wanted a tender nurse.\n\nFor some time she had observed, that she was not treated with the same\nrespect as formerly; her favors were forgotten when no more were\nexpected. This ingratitude hurt her, as did a similar instance in the\nwoman who came out of the ship. Mary had hitherto supported her; as her\nfinances were growing low, she hinted to her, that she ought to try to\nearn her own subsistence: the woman in return loaded her with abuse.\n\nTwo months were elapsed; she had not seen, or heard from Henry. He was\nsick--nay, perhaps had forgotten her; all the world was dreary, and all\nthe people ungrateful.\n\nShe sunk into apathy, and endeavouring to rouse herself out of it, she\nwrote in her book another fragment:\n\n\"Surely life is a dream, a frightful one! and after those rude,\ndisjointed images are fled, will light ever break in? Shall I ever feel\njoy? Do all suffer like me; or am I framed so as to be particularly\nsusceptible of misery? It is true, I have experienced the most rapturous\nemotions--short-lived delight!--ethereal beam, which only serves to shew\nmy present misery--yet lie still, my throbbing heart, or burst; and my\nbrain--why dost thou whirl about at such a terrifying rate? why do\nthoughts so rapidly rush into my mind, and yet when they disappear\nleave such deep traces? I could almost wish for the madman's happiness,\nand in a strong imagination lose a sense of woe.\n\n\"Oh! reason, thou boasted guide, why desert me, like the world, when I\nmost need thy assistance! Canst thou not calm this internal tumult, and\ndrive away the death-like sadness which presses so sorely on me,--a\nsadness surely very nearly allied to despair. I am now the prey of\napathy--I could wish for the former storms! a ray of hope sometimes\nillumined my path; I had a pursuit; but now _it visits not my haunts\nforlorn_. Too well have I loved my fellow creatures! I have been wounded\nby ingratitude; from every one it has something of the serpent's tooth.\n\n\"When overwhelmed by sorrow, I have met unkindness; I looked for some\none to have pity on me; but found none!--The healing balm of sympathy is\ndenied; I weep, a solitary wretch, and the hot tears scald my cheeks. I\nhave not the medicine of life, the dear chimera I have so often chased,\na friend. Shade of my loved Ann! dost thou ever visit thy poor Mary?\nRefined spirit, thou wouldst weep, could angels weep, to see her\nstruggling with passions she cannot subdue; and feelings which corrode\nher small portion of comfort!\"\n\nShe could not write any more; she wished herself far distant from all\nhuman society; a thick gloom spread itself over her mind: but did not\nmake her forget the very beings she wished to fly from. She sent for the\npoor woman she found in the garret; gave her money to clothe herself\nand children, and buy some furniture for a little hut, in a large\ngarden, the master of which agreed to employ her husband, who had been\nbred a gardener. Mary promised to visit the family, and see their new\nabode when she was able to go out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIV.\n\n\nMary still continued weak and low, though it was spring, and all nature\nbegan to look gay; with more than usual brightness the sun shone, and a\nlittle robin which she had cherished during the winter sung one of his\nbest songs. The family were particularly civil this fine morning, and\ntried to prevail on her to walk out. Any thing like kindness melted her;\nshe consented.\n\nSofter emotions banished her melancholy, and she directed her steps to\nthe habitation she had rendered comfortable.\n\nEmerging out of a dreary chamber, all nature looked cheerful; when she\nhad last walked out, snow covered the ground, and bleak winds pierced\nher through and through: now the hedges were green, the blossoms adorned\nthe trees, and the birds sung. She reached the dwelling, without being\nmuch exhausted and while she rested there, observed the children\nsporting on the grass, with improved complexions. The mother with tears\nthanked her deliverer, and pointed out her comforts. Mary's tears flowed\nnot only from sympathy, but a complication of feelings and recollections\nthe affections which bound her to her fellow creatures began again to\nplay, and reanimated nature. She observed the change in herself, tried\nto account for it, and wrote with her pencil a rhapsody on sensibility.\n\n\"Sensibility is the most exquisite feeling of which the human soul is\nsusceptible: when it pervades us, we feel happy; and could it last\nunmixed, we might form some conjecture of the bliss of those\nparadisiacal days, when the obedient passions were under the dominion of\nreason, and the impulses of the heart did not need correction.\n\n\"It is this quickness, this delicacy of feeling, which enables us to\nrelish the sublime touches of the poet, and the painter; it is this,\nwhich expands the soul, gives an enthusiastic greatness, mixed with\ntenderness, when we view the magnificent objects of nature; or hear of a\ngood action. The same effect we experience in the spring, when we hail\nthe returning sun, and the consequent renovation of nature; when the\nflowers unfold themselves, and exhale their sweets, and the voice of\nmusic is heard in the land. Softened by tenderness; the soul is\ndisposed to be virtuous. Is any sensual gratification to be compared to\nthat of feelings the eves moistened after having comforted the\nunfortunate?\n\n\"Sensibility is indeed the foundation of all our happiness; but these\nraptures are unknown to the depraved sensualist, who is only moved by\nwhat strikes his gross senses; the delicate embellishments of nature\nescape his notice; as do the gentle and interesting affections.--But it\nis only to be felt; it escapes discussion.\"\n\nShe then returned home, and partook of the family meal, which was\nrendered more cheerful by the presence of a man, past the meridian of\nlife, of polished manners, and dazzling wit. He endeavoured to draw Mary\nout, and succeeded; she entered into conversation, and some of her\nartless flights of genius struck him with surprise; he found she had a\ncapacious mind, and that her reason was as profound as her imagination\nwas lively. She glanced from earth to heaven, and caught the light of\ntruth. Her expressive countenance shewed what passed in her mind, and\nher tongue was ever the faithful interpreter of her heart; duplicity\nnever threw a shade over her words or actions. Mary found him a man of\nlearning; and the exercise of her understanding would frequently make\nher forget her griefs, when nothing else could, except benevolence.\n\nThis man had known the mistress of the house in her youth; good nature\ninduced him to visit her; but when he saw Mary he had another\ninducement. Her appearance, and above all, her genius, and cultivation\nof mind, roused his curiosity; but her dignified manners had such an\neffect on him, he was obliged to suppress it. He knew men, as well as\nbooks; his conversation was entertaining and improving. In Mary's\ncompany he doubted whether heaven was peopled with spirits masculine;\nand almost forgot that he had called the sex \"the pretty play things\nthat render life tolerable.\"\n\nHe had been the slave of beauty, the captive of sense; love he ne'er had\nfelt; the mind never rivetted the chain, nor had the purity of it made\nthe body appear lovely in his eyes. He was humane, despised meanness;\nbut was vain of his abilities, and by no means a useful member of\nsociety. He talked often of the beauty of virtue; but not having any\nsolid foundation to build the practice on, he was only a shining, or\nrather a sparkling character: and though his fortune enabled him to\nhunt down pleasure, he was discontented.\n\nMary observed his character, and wrote down a train of reflections,\nwhich these observations led her to make; these reflections received a\ntinge from her mind; the present state of it, was that kind of painful\nquietness which arises from reason clouded by disgust; she had not yet\nlearned to be resigned; vague hopes agitated her.\n\n\"There are some subjects that are so enveloped in clouds, as you\ndissipate one, another overspreads it. Of this kind are our reasonings\nconcerning happiness; till we are obliged to cry out with the Apostle,\n_That it hath not entered into the heart of man to conceive in what it\ncould consist_, or how satiety could be prevented. Man seems formed for\naction, though the passions are seldom properly managed; they are\neither so languid as not to serve as a spur, or else so violent, as to\noverleap all bounds.\n\n\"Every individual has its own peculiar trials; and anguish, in one shape\nor other, visits every heart. Sensibility produces flights of virtue;\nand not curbed by reason, is on the brink of vice talking, and even\nthinking of virtue.\n\n\"Christianity can only afford just principles to govern the wayward\nfeelings and impulses of the heart: every good disposition runs wild, if\nnot transplanted into this soil; but how hard is it to keep the heart\ndiligently, though convinced that the issues of life depend on it.\n\n\"It is very difficult to discipline the mind of a thinker, or reconcile\nhim to the weakness, the inconsistency of his understanding; and a\nstill more laborious task for him to conquer his passions, and learn to\nseek content, instead of happiness. Good dispositions, and virtuous\npropensities, without the light of the Gospel, produce eccentric\ncharacters: comet-like, they are always in extremes; while revelation\nresembles the laws of attraction, and produces uniformity; but too often\nis the attraction feeble; and the light so obscured by passion, as to\nforce the bewildered soul to fly into void space, and wander in\nconfusion.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXV.\n\n\nA few mornings after, as Mary was sitting ruminating, harassed by\nperplexing thoughts, and fears, a letter was delivered to her: the\nservant waited for an answer. Her heart palpitated; it was from Henry;\nshe held it some time in her hand, then tore it open; it was not a long\none; and only contained an account of a relapse, which prevented his\nsailing in the first packet, as he had intended. Some tender enquiries\nwere added, concerning her health, and state of mind; but they were\nexpressed in rather a formal style: it vexed her, and the more so, as it\nstopped the current of affection, which the account of his arrival and\nillness had made flow to her heart--it ceased to beat for a moment--she\nread the passage over again; but could not tell what she was hurt\nby--only that it did not answer the expectations of her affection. She\nwrote a laconic, incoherent note in return, allowing him to call on her\nthe next day--he had requested permission at the conclusion of his\nletter.\n\nHer mind was then painfully active; she could not read or walk; she\ntried to fly from herself, to forget the long hours that were yet to run\nbefore to-morrow could arrive: she knew not what time he would come;\ncertainly in the morning, she concluded; the morning then was anxiously\nwished for; and every wish produced a sigh, that arose from expectation\non the stretch, damped by fear and vain regret.\n\nTo beguile the tedious time, Henry's favorite tunes were sung; the books\nthey read together turned over; and the short epistle read at least a\nhundred times.--Any one who had seen her, would have supposed that she\nwas trying to decypher Chinese characters.\n\nAfter a sleepless night, she hailed the tardy day, watched the rising\nsun, and then listened for every footstep, and started if she heard the\nstreet door opened. At last he came, and she who had been counting the\nhours, and doubting whether the earth moved, would gladly have escaped\nthe approaching interview.\n\nWith an unequal, irresolute pace, she went to meet him; but when she\nbeheld his emaciated countenance, all the tenderness, which the\nformality of his letter had damped, returned, and a mournful\npresentiment stilled the internal conflict. She caught his hand, and\nlooking wistfully at him, exclaimed, \"Indeed, you are not well!\"\n\n\"I am very far from well; but it matters not,\" added he with a smile of\nresignation; \"my native air may work wonders, and besides, my mother is\na tender nurse, and I shall sometimes see thee.\"\n\nMary felt for the first time in her life, envy; she wished\ninvoluntarily, that all the comfort he received should be from her. She\nenquired about the symptoms of his disorder; and heard that he had been\nvery ill; she hastily drove away the fears, that former dear bought\nexperience suggested: and again and again did she repeat, that she was\nsure he would soon recover. She would then look in his face, to see if\nhe assented, and ask more questions to the same purport. She tried to\navoid speaking of herself, and Henry left her, with, a promise of\nvisiting her the next day.\n\nHer mind was now engrossed by one fear--yet she would not allow herself\nto think that she feared an event she could not name. She still saw his\npale face; the sound of his voice still vibrated on her ears; she tried\nto retain it; she listened, looked round, wept, and prayed.\n\nHenry had enlightened the desolate scene: was this charm of life to fade\naway, and, like the baseless fabric of a vision, leave not a wreck\nbehind? These thoughts disturbed her reason, she shook her head, as if\nto drive them out of it; a weight, a heavy one, was on her heart; all\nwas not well there.\n\nOut of this reverie she was soon woke to keener anguish, by the arrival\nof a letter from her husband; it came to Lisbon after her departure:\nHenry had forwarded it to her, but did not choose to deliver it\nhimself, for a very obvious reason; it might have produced a\nconversation he wished for some time to avoid; and his precaution took\nits rise almost equally from benevolence and love.\n\nShe could not muster up sufficient resolution to break the seal: her\nfears were not prophetic, for the contents gave her comfort. He informed\nher that he intended prolonging his tour, as he was now his own master,\nand wished to remain some time on the continent, and in particular to\nvisit Italy without any restraint: but his reasons for it appeared\nchildish; it was not to cultivate his taste, or tread on classic ground,\nwhere poets and philosophers caught their lore; but to join in the\nmasquerades, and such burlesque amusements.\n\nThese instances of folly relieved Mary, in some degree reconciled her\nto herself added fuel to the devouring flame--and silenced something\nlike a pang, which reason and conscience made her feel, when she\nreflected, that it is the office of Religion to reconcile us to the\nseemingly hard dispensations of providence; and that no inclination,\nhowever strong, should oblige us to desert the post assigned us, or\nforce us to forget that virtue should be an active principle; and that\nthe most desirable station, is the one that exercises our faculties,\nrefines our affections, and enables us to be useful.\n\nOne reflection continually wounded her repose; she feared not poverty;\nher wants were few; but in giving up a fortune, she gave up the power of\ncomforting the miserable, and making the sad heart sing for joy.\n\nHeaven had endowed her with uncommon humanity, to render her one of His\nbenevolent agents, a messenger of peace; and should she attend to her\nown inclinations?\n\nThese suggestions, though they could not subdue a violent passion,\nincreased her misery. One moment she was a heroine, half determined to\nbear whatever fate should inflict; the next, her mind would recoil--and\ntenderness possessed her whole soul. Some instances of Henry's\naffection, his worth and genius, were remembered: and the earth was only\na vale of tears, because he was not to sojourn with her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVI.\n\n\nHenry came the next day, and once or twice in the course of the\nfollowing week; but still Mary kept up some little formality, a certain\nconsciousness restrained her; and Henry did not enter on the subject\nwhich he found she wished to avoid. In the course of conversation,\nhowever, she mentioned to him, that she earnestly desired to obtain a\nplace in one of the public offices for Ann's brother, as the family were\nagain in a declining way.\n\nHenry attended, made a few enquiries, and dropped the subject; but the\nfollowing week, she heard him enter with unusual haste; it was to inform\nher, that he had made interest with a person of some consequence, whom\nhe had once obliged in a very disagreeable exigency, in a foreign\ncountry; and that he had procured a place for her friend, which would\ninfallibly lead to something better, if he behaved with propriety. Mary\ncould not speak to thank him; emotions of gratitude and love suffused\nher face; her blood eloquently spoke. She delighted to receive benefits\nthrough the medium of her fellow creatures; but to receive them from\nHenry was exquisite pleasure.\n\nAs the summer advanced, Henry grew worse; the closeness of the air, in\nthe metropolis, affected his breath; and his mother insisted on his\nfixing on some place in the country, where she would accompany him. He\ncould not think of going far off, but chose a little village on the\nbanks of the Thames, near Mary's dwelling: he then introduced her to his\nmother.\n\nThey frequently went down the river in a boat; Henry would take his\nviolin, and Mary would sometimes sing, or read, to them. She pleased his\nmother; she inchanted him. It was an advantage to Mary that friendship\nfirst possessed her heart; it opened it to all the softer sentiments of\nhumanity:--and when this first affection was torn away, a similar one\nsprung up, with a still tenderer sentiment added to it.\n\nThe last evening they were on the water, the clouds grew suddenly black,\nand broke in violent showers, which interrupted the solemn stillness\nthat had prevailed previous to it. The thunder roared; and the oars\nplying quickly, in order to reach the shore, occasioned a not\nunpleasing sound. Mary drew still nearer Henry; she wished to have\nsought with him a watry grave; to have escaped the horror of surviving\nhim.--She spoke not, but Henry saw the workings of her mind--he felt\nthem; threw his arm round her waist--and they enjoyed the luxury of\nwretchedness.--As they touched the shore, Mary perceived that Henry was\nwet; with eager anxiety she cried, What shall I do!--this day will kill\nthee, and I shall not die with thee!\n\nThis accident put a stop to their pleasurable excursions; it had injured\nhim, and brought on the spitting of blood he was subject to--perhaps it\nwas not the cold that he caught, that occasioned it. In vain did Mary\ntry to shut her eyes; her fate pursued her! Henry every day grew worse\nand worse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVII.\n\n\nOppressed by her foreboding fears, her sore mind was hurt by new\ninstances of ingratitude: disgusted with the family, whose misfortunes\nhad often disturbed her repose, and lost in anticipated sorrow, she\nrambled she knew not where; when turning down a shady walk, she\ndiscovered her feet had taken the path they delighted to tread. She saw\nHenry sitting in his garden alone; he quickly opened the garden-gate,\nand she sat down by him.\n\n\"I did not,\" said he, \"expect to see thee this evening, my dearest Mary;\nbut I was thinking of thee. Heaven has endowed thee with an uncommon\nportion of fortitude, to support one of the most affectionate hearts in\nthe world. This is not a time for disguise; I know I am dear to\nthee--and my affection for thee is twisted with every fibre of my\nheart.--I loved thee ever since I have been acquainted with thine: thou\nart the being my fancy has delighted to form; but which I imagined\nexisted only there! In a little while the shades of death will encompass\nme--ill-fated love perhaps added strength to my disease, and smoothed\nthe rugged path. Try, my love, to fulfil thy destined course--try to add\nto thy other virtues patience. I could have wished, for thy sake, that\nwe could have died together--or that I could live to shield thee from\nthe assaults of an unfeeling world! Could I but offer thee an asylum in\nthese arms--a faithful bosom, in which thou couldst repose all thy\ngriefs--\" He pressed her to it, and she returned the pressure--he felt her\nthrobbing heart. A mournful silence ensued! when he resumed the\nconversation. \"I wished to prepare thee for the blow--too surely do I\nfeel that it will not be long delayed! The passion I have nursed is so\npure, that death cannot extinguish it--or tear away the impression thy\nvirtues have made on my soul. I would fain comfort thee--\"\n\n\"Talk not of comfort,\" interrupted Mary, \"it will be in heaven with thee\nand Ann--while I shall remain on earth the veriest wretch!\"--She grasped\nhis hand.\n\n\"There we shall meet, my love, my Mary, in our Father's--\" His voice\nfaultered; he could not finish the sentence; he was almost\nsuffocated--they both wept, their tears relieved them; they walked\nslowly to the garden-gate (Mary would not go into the house); they could\nnot say farewel when they reached it--and Mary hurried down the lane; to\nspare Henry the pain of witnessing her emotions.\n\nWhen she lost sight of the house she sat down on the ground, till it\ngrew late, thinking of all that had passed. Full of these thoughts, she\ncrept along, regardless of the descending rain; when lifting up her eyes\nto heaven, and then turning them wildly on the prospects around, without\nmarking them; she only felt that the scene accorded with her present\nstate of mind. It was the last glimmering of twilight, with a full moon,\nover which clouds continually flitted. Where am I wandering, God of\nMercy! she thought; she alluded to the wanderings of her mind. In what a\nlabyrinth am I lost! What miseries have I already encountered--and what\na number lie still before me.\n\nHer thoughts flew rapidly to something. I could be happy listening to\nhim, soothing his cares.--Would he not smile upon me--call me his own\nMary? I am not his--said she with fierceness--I am a wretch! and she\nheaved a sigh that almost broke her heart, while the big tears rolled\ndown her burning cheeks; but still her exercised mind, accustomed to\nthink, began to observe its operation, though the barrier of reason was\nalmost carried away, and all the faculties not restrained by her, were\nrunning into confusion. Wherefore am I made thus? Vain are my\nefforts--I cannot live without loving--and love leads to madness.--Yet\nI will not weep; and her eyes were now fixed by despair, dry and\nmotionless; and then quickly whirled about with a look of distraction.\n\nShe looked for hope; but found none--all was troubled waters.--No where\ncould she find rest. I have already paced to and fro in the earth; it is\nnot my abiding place--may I not too go home! Ah! no. Is this complying\nwith my Henry's request, could a spirit thus disengaged expect to\nassociate with his? Tears of tenderness strayed down her relaxed\ncountenance, and her softened heart heaved more regularly. She felt the\nrain, and turned to her solitary home.\n\nFatigued by the tumultuous emotions she had endured, when she entered\nthe house she ran to her own room, sunk on the bed; and exhausted\nnature soon closed her eyes; but active fancy was still awake, and a\nthousand fearful dreams interrupted her slumbers.\n\nFeverish and languid, she opened her eyes, and saw the unwelcome sun\ndart his rays through a window, the curtains of which she had forgotten\nto draw. The dew hung on the adjacent trees, and added to the lustre;\nthe little robin began his song, and distant birds joined. She looked;\nher countenance was still vacant--her sensibility was absorbed by one\nobject.\n\nDid I ever admire the rising sun, she slightly thought, turning from the\nWindow, and shutting her eyes: she recalled to view the last night's\nscene. His faltering voice, lingering step, and the look of tender woe,\nwere all graven on her heart; as were the words \"Could these arms\nshield thee from sorrow--afford thee an asylum from an unfeeling world.\"\nThe pressure to his bosom was not forgot. For a moment she was happy;\nbut in a long-drawn sigh every delightful sensation evaporated.\nSoon--yes, very soon, will the grave again receive all I love! and the\nremnant of my days--she could not proceed--Were there then days to come\nafter that?\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVIII.\n\n\nJust as she was going to quit her room, to visit Henry, his mother\ncalled on her.\n\n\"My son is worse to-day,\" said she, \"I come to request you to spend not\nonly this day, but a week or two with me.--Why should I conceal any\nthing from you? Last night my child made his mother his confident, and,\nin the anguish of his heart, requested me to be thy friend--when I shall\nbe childless. I will not attempt to describe what I felt when he talked\nthus to me. If I am to lose the support of my age, and be again a\nwidow--may I call her Child whom my Henry wishes me to adopt?\"\n\nThis new instance of Henry's disinterested affection, Mary felt most\nforcibly; and striving to restrain the complicated emotions, and sooth\nthe wretched mother, she almost fainted: when the unhappy parent forced\ntears from her, by saying, \"I deserve this blow; my partial fondness\nmade me neglect him, when most he wanted a mother's care; this neglect,\nperhaps, first injured his constitution: righteous Heaven has made my\ncrime its own punishment; and now I am indeed a mother, I shall loss my\nchild--my only child!\"\n\nWhen they were a little more composed they hastened to the invalide; but\nduring the short ride, the mother related several instances of Henry's\ngoodness of heart. Mary's tears were not those of unmixed anguish; the\ndisplay of his virtues gave her extreme delight--yet human nature\nprevailed; she trembled to think they would soon unfold themselves in a\nmore genial clime.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIX.\n\n\nShe found Henry very ill. The physician had some weeks before declared\nhe never knew a person with a similar pulse recover. Henry was certain\nhe could not live long; all the rest he could obtain, was procured by\nopiates. Mary now enjoyed the melancholy pleasure of nursing him, and\nsoftened by her tenderness the pains she could not remove. Every sigh\ndid she stifle, every tear restrain, when he could see or hear them. She\nwould boast of her resignation--yet catch eagerly at the least ray of\nhope. While he slept she would support his pillow, and rest her head\nwhere she could feel his breath. She loved him better than herself--she\ncould not pray for his recovery; she could only say, The will of Heaven\nbe done.\n\nWhile she was in this state, she labored to acquire fortitude; but one\ntender look destroyed it all--she rather labored, indeed, to make him\nbelieve he was resigned, than really to be so.\n\nShe wished to receive the sacrament with him, as a bond of union which\nwas to extend beyond the grave. She did so, and received comfort from\nit; she rose above her misery.\n\nHis end was now approaching. Mary sat on the side of the bed. His eyes\nappeared fixed--no longer agitated by passion, he only felt that it was\na fearful thing to die. The soul retired to the citadel; but it was not\nnow solely filled by the image of her who in silent despair watched for\nhis last breath. Collected, a frightful calmness stilled every turbulent\nemotion.\n\nThe mother's grief was more audible. Henry had for some time only\nattended to Mary--Mary pitied the parent, whose stings of conscience\nincreased her sorrow; she whispered him, \"Thy mother weeps, disregarded\nby thee; oh! comfort her!--My mother, thy son blesses thee.--\" The\noppressed parent left the room. And Mary _waited_ to see him die.\n\nShe pressed with trembling eagerness his parched lips--he opened his\neyes again; the spreading film retired, and love returned them--he gave\na look--it was never forgotten. My Mary, will you be comforted?\n\nYes, yes, she exclaimed in a firm voice; you go to be happy--I am not a\ncomplete wretch! The words almost choked her.\n\nHe was a long time silent; the opiate produced a kind of stupor. At\nlast, in an agony, he cried, It is dark; I cannot see thee; raise me up.\nWhere is Mary? did she not say she delighted to support me? let me die\nin her arms.\n\nHer arms were opened to receive him; they trembled not. Again he was\nobliged to lie down, resting on her: as the agonies increased he leaned\ntowards her: the soul seemed flying to her, as it escaped out of its\nprison. The breathing was interrupted; she heard distinctly the last\nsigh--and lifting up to Heaven her eyes, Father, receive his spirit, she\ncalmly cried.\n\nThe attendants gathered round; she moved not, nor heard the clamor; the\nhand seemed yet to press hers; it still was warm. A ray of light from\nan opened window discovered the pale face.\n\nShe left the room, and retired to one very near it; and sitting down on\nthe floor, fixed her eyes on the door of the apartment which contained\nthe body. Every event of her life rushed across her mind with wonderful\nrapidity--yet all was still--fate had given the finishing stroke. She\nsat till midnight.--Then rose in a phrensy, went into the apartment, and\ndesired those who watched the body to retire.\n\nShe knelt by the bed side;--an enthusiastic devotion overcame the\ndictates of despair.--She prayed most ardently to be supported, and\ndedicated herself to the service of that Being into whose hands, she had\ncommitted the spirit she almost adored--again--and again,--she prayed\nwildly--and fervently--but attempting to touch the lifeless hand--her\nhead swum--she sunk--\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXX.\n\n\nThree months after, her only friend, the mother of her lost Henry began\nto be alarmed, at observing her altered appearance; and made her own\nhealth a pretext for travelling. These complaints roused Mary out of her\ntorpid state; she imagined a new duty now forced her to exert herself--a\nduty love made sacred!--\n\nThey went to Bath, from that to Bristol; but the latter place they\nquickly left; the sight of the sick that resort there, they neither of\nthem could bear. From Bristol they flew to Southampton. The road was\npleasant--yet Mary shut her eyes;--or if they were open, green fields\nand commons, passed in quick succession, and left no more traces behind\nthan if they had been waves of the sea.\n\nSome time after they were settled at Southampton, they met the man who\ntook so much notice of Mary, soon after her return to England. He\nrenewed his acquaintance; he was really interested in her fate, as he\nhad heard her uncommon story; besides, he knew her husband; knew him to\nbe a good-natured, weak man. He saw him soon after his arrival in his\nnative country, and prevented his hastening to enquire into the reasons\nof Mary's strange conduct. He desired him not to be too precipitate, if\nhe ever wished to possess an invaluable treasure. He was guided by him,\nand allowed him to follow Mary to Southampton, and speak first to her\nfriend.\n\nThis friend determined to trust to her native strength of mind, and\ninformed her of the circumstance; but she overrated it: Mary was not\nable, for a few days after the intelligence, to fix on the mode of\nconduct she ought now to pursue. But at last she conquered her disgust,\nand wrote her _husband_ an account of what had passed since she had\ndropped his correspondence.\n\nHe came in person to answer the letter. Mary fainted when he approached\nher unexpectedly. Her disgust returned with additional force, in spite\nof previous reasonings, whenever he appeared; yet she was prevailed on\nto promise to live with him, if he would permit her to pass one year,\ntravelling from place to place; he was not to accompany her.\n\nThe time too quickly elapsed, and she gave him her hand--the struggle\nwas almost more than she could endure. She tried to appear calm; time\nmellowed her grief, and mitigated her torments; but when her husband\nwould take her hand, or mention any thing like love, she would instantly\nfeel a sickness, a faintness at her heart, and wish, involuntarily, that\nthe earth would open and swallow her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP.

It is an important task and can be applied to several real-world applications. Many methods have been proposed to solve the text summarization problem BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 . There are two main text summarization techniques: extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization generates summary by selecting salient sentences or phrases from the source text, while abstractive methods paraphrase and restructure sentences to compose the summary. We focus on abstractive summarization in this work as it is more flexible and thus can generate more diverse summaries.\nRecently, many abstractive approaches are introduced based on neural sequence-to-sequence framework BIBREF4 , BIBREF0 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF5 . Based on the sequence-to-sequence model with copy mechanism BIBREF6 , BIBREF0 incorporates a coverage vector to track and control attention scores on source text. BIBREF4 introduce intra-temporal attention processes in the encoder and decoder to address the repetition and incoherent problem.\nThere are two issues in previous abstractive methods: 1) these methods use left-context-only decoder, thus do not have complete context when predicting each word. 2) they do not utilize the pre-trained contextualized language models on the decoder side, so it is more difficult for the decoder to learn summary representations, context interactions and language modeling together.\nRecently, BERT has been successfully used in various natural language processing tasks, such as textual entailment, name entity recognition and machine reading comprehensions. In this paper, we present a novel natural language generation model based on pre-trained language models (we use BERT in this work). As far as we know, this is the first work to extend BERT to the sequence generation task. To address the above issues of previous abstractive methods, in our model, we design a two-stage decoding process to make good use of BERT's context modeling ability. On the first stage, we generate the summary using a left-context-only-decoder. On the second stage, we mask each word of the summary and predict the refined word one-by-one using a refine decoder. To further improve the naturalness of the generated sequence, we cooperate reinforcement objective with the refine decoder.\nThe main contributions of this work are:\n1. We propose a natural language generation model based on BERT, making good use of the pre-trained language model in the encoder and decoder process, and the model can be trained end-to-end without handcrafted features.\n2. We design a two-stage decoder process. In this architecture, our model can generate each word of the summary considering both sides' context information.\n3. We conduct experiments on the benchmark datasets CNN/Daily Mail and New York Times. Our model achieves a 33.33 average of ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L on the CNN/Daily Mail, which is state-of-the-art. On the New York Times dataset, our model achieves about 5.6% relative improvement over ROUGE-1.\nText Summarization\nIn this paper, we focus on single-document multi-sentence summarization and propose a supervised abstractive model based on the neural attentive sequence-to-sequence framework which consists of two parts: a neural network for the encoder and another network for the decoder. The encoder encodes the input sequence to intermediate representation and the decoder predicts one word at a time step given the input sequence representation vector and previous decoded output. The goal of the model is to maximize the probability of generating the correct target sequences. In the encoding and generation process, the attention mechanism is used to concentrate on the most important positions of text. The learning objective of most sequence-to-sequence models is to minimize the negative log likelihood of the generated sequence as following equation shows, where $y^*_i$ is the i-th ground-truth summary token.\n$$Loss = - \\log \\sum _{t=1}^N P(y_t^*|y_{<t}^*, X)$$   (Eq. 3)\nHowever, with this objective, traditional sequence generation models consider only one direction context in the decoding process, which could cause performance degradation since complete context of one token contains preceding and following tokens, thus feeding only preceded decoded words to the decoder so that the model may generate unnatural sequences. For example, attentive sequence-to-sequence models often generate sequences with repeated phrases which harm the naturalness. Some previous works mitigate this problem by improving the attention calculation process, but in this paper we show that feeding bi-directional context instead of left-only-context can better alleviate this problem.\nText summarization models are usually classified to abstractive and extractive ones. Recently, extractive models like DeepChannel BIBREF8 , rnn-ext+RL BIBREF9 and NeuSUM BIBREF2 achieve higher performances using well-designed structures. For example, DeepChannel propose a salience estimation network and iteratively extract salient sentences. BIBREF16 train a sentence compression model to teach another latent variable extractive model.\nAlso, several recent works focus on improving abstractive methods. BIBREF3 design a content selector to over-determine phrases in a source document that should be part of the summary. BIBREF11 introduce inconsistency loss to force words in less attended sentences(which determined by extractive model) to have lower generation probabilities. BIBREF5 extend seq2seq model with an information selection network to generate more informative summaries.\nBi-Directional Pre-Trained Context Encoders\nRecently, context encoders such as ELMo, GPT, and BERT have been widely used in many NLP tasks. These models are pre-trained on a huge unlabeled corpus and can generate better contextualized token embeddings, thus the approaches built on top of them can achieve better performance.\nSince our method is based on BERT, we illustrate the process briefly here. BERT consists of several layers. In each layer there is first a multi-head self-attention sub-layer and then a linear affine sub-layer with the residual connection. In each self-attention sub-layer the attention scores $e_{ij}$ are first calculated as Eq. ( 5 ) () shows, in which $d_e$ is output dimension, and $W^Q, W^K, W^V$ are parameter matrices.\n$$&a_{ij} = \\cfrac{(h_iW_Q)(h_jW_K)^T}{\\sqrt{d_e}}  \\\\ &e_{ij} = \\cfrac{\\exp {e_{ij}}}{\\sum _{k=1}^N\\exp {e_{ik}}} $$   (Eq. 5)\nThen the output is calculated as Eq. ( 6 ) shows, which is the weighted sum of previous outputs $h$ added by previous output $h_i$ . The last layer outputs is context encoding of input sequence.\n$$o_i = h_i + \\sum _{j=1}^{N} e_{ij}(h_j W_V) $$   (Eq. 6)\nDespite the wide usage and huge success, there is also a mismatch problem between these pre-trained context encoders and sequence-to-sequence models. The issue is that while using a pre-trained context encoder like GPT or BERT, they model token-level representations by conditioning on both direction context. During pre-training, they are fed with complete sequences. However, with a left-context-only decoder, these pre-trained language models will suffer from incomplete and inconsistent context and thus cannot generate good enough context-aware word representations, especially during the inference process.\nModel\nIn this section, we describe the structure of our model, which learns to generate an abstractive multi-sentence summary from a given source document.\nBased on the sequence-to-sequence framework built on top of BERT, we first design a refine decoder at word-level to tackle the two problems described in the above section. We also introduce a discrete objective for the refine decoders to reduce the exposure bias problem. The overall structure of our model is illustrated in Figure 1 .\nProblem Formulation\nWe denote the input document as $X = \\lbrace x_1, \\ldots , x_m\\rbrace $ where $x_i \\in \\mathcal {X}$ represents one source token. The corresponding summary is denoted as $Y = \\lbrace y_1, \\ldots , y_L\\rbrace $ , $L$ represents the summary length.\nGiven input document $X$ , we first predict the summary draft by a left-context-only decoder, and then using the generated summary draft we can condition on both context sides and refine the content of the summary. The draft will guide and constrain the refine process of summary.\nSummary Draft Generation\nThe summary draft is based on the sequence-to-sequence model. On the encoder side the input document $X$ is encoded into representation vectors $H = \\lbrace h_1, \\ldots , h_m\\rbrace $ , and then fed to the decoder to generate the summary draft $A = \\lbrace a_1, \\ldots , a_{|a|}\\rbrace $ .\nWe simply use BERT as the encoder. It first maps the input sequence to word embeddings and then computes document embeddings as the encoder's output, denoted by following equation.\n$$H = BERT(x_1, \\ldots , x_m)$$   (Eq. 10)\nIn the draft decoder, we first introduce BERT's word embedding matrix to map the previous summary draft outputs $\\lbrace y_1, \\ldots , y_{t-1}\\rbrace $ into embeddings vectors $\\lbrace q_1, \\ldots , q_{t-1}\\rbrace $ at t-th time step. Note that as the input sequence of the decoder is not complete, we do not use the BERT network to predict the context vectors here.\nThen we introduce an $N$ layer Transformer decoder to learn the conditional probability $P(A|H)$ . Transformer's decoder-encoder multi-head attention helps the decoder learn soft alignments between summary and source document. At the t-th time step, the draft decoder predicts output probability conditioned on previous outputs and encoder hidden representations as Eq. ( 13 ) shows, in which $q_{<t} = \\lbrace q_1, \\ldots , q_{t-1}\\rbrace $ . Each generated sequence will be truncated in the first position of a special token '[PAD]'.\n$$&P^{vocab}_t(w) = f_{dec}(q_{<t}, H)  \\\\ &L_{dec} = \\sum _{i=1}^{|a|} -\\log P(a_i = y_i^*|a_{< i}, H) $$   (Eq. 13)\nAs Eq. () shows, the decoder's learning objective is to minimize negative likelihood of conditional probability, in which $y_i^*$ is the i-th ground truth word of summary.\nHowever a decoder with this structure is not sufficient enough: if we use the BERT network in this decoder, then during training and inference, in-complete context(part of sentence) is fed into the BERT module, and although we can fine-tune BERT's parameters, the input distribution is quite different from the pre-train process, and thus harms the quality of generated context representations.\nIf we just use the embedding matrix here, it will be more difficult for the decoder with fresh parameters to learn to model representations as well as vocabulary probabilities, from a relative small corpus compared to BERT's huge pre-training corpus. In a word, the decoder cannot utilize BERT's ability to generate high quality context vectors, which will also harm performance.\nThis issue exists when using any other contextualized word representations, so we design a refine process to mitigate it in our approach which will be described in the next sub-section.\nAs some summary tokens are out-of-vocabulary words and occurs in input document, we incorporate copy mechanism BIBREF6 based on the Transformer decoder, we will describe it briefly.\nAt decoder time step $t$ , we first calculate the attention probability distribution over source document $X$ using the bi-linear dot product of the last layer decoder output of Transformer $o_t$ and the encoder output $h_j$ , as Eq. ( 15 ) () shows.\n$$u_t^j =& o_t W_c h_j \\\\ \\alpha _t^j =& \\cfrac{\\exp {u_t^j}}{\\sum _{k=1}^N\\exp {u_t^k}} $$   (Eq. 15)\nWe then calculate copying gate $g_t\\in [0, 1]$ , which makes a soft choice between selecting from source and generating from vocabulary, $W_c, W_g, b_g$ are parameters:\n$$g_t = sigmoid(W_g \\cdot [o_t, h] + b_g) $$   (Eq. 16)\nUsing $g_t$ we calculate the weighted sum of copy probability and generation probability to get the final predicted probability of extended vocabulary $\\mathcal {V} + \\mathcal {X}$ , where $\\mathcal {X}$ is the set of out of vocabulary words from the source document. The final probability is calculated as follow:\n$$P_t(w) = (1-g_t)P_t^{vocab}(w) + g_t\\sum _{i:w_i=w} \\alpha _t^i$$   (Eq. 17)\nSummary Refine Process\nThe main reason to introduce the refine process is to enhance the decoder using BERT's contextualized representations, so we do not modify the encoder and reuse it during this process.\nOn the decoder side, we propose a new word-level refine decoder. The refine decoder receives a generated summary draft as input, and outputs a refined summary. It first masks each word in the summary draft one by one, then feeds the draft to BERT to generate context vectors. Finally it predicts a refined summary word using an $N$ layer Transformer decoder which is the same as the draft decoder. At t-th time step the n-th word of input summary is masked, and the decoder predicts the n-th refined word given other words of the summary.\nThe learning objective of this process is shown in Eq. ( 19 ), $y_i$ is the i-th summary word and $y_{i}^*$ for the ground-truth summary word, and $a_{\\ne i} = \\lbrace a_1, \\ldots , a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}, \\ldots , a_{|y|}\\rbrace $ .\n$$L_{refine} = \\sum _{i=1}^{|y|} -\\log P(y_i = y_i^*|a_{\\ne i}, H) $$   (Eq. 19)\nFrom the view of BERT or other contextualized embeddings, the refine decoding process provides a more complete input sequence which is consistent with their pre-training processes. Intuitively, this process works as follows: first the draft decoder writes a summary draft based on a document, and then the refine decoder edits the draft. It concentrates on one word at a time, based on the source document as well as other words.\nWe design the word-level refine decoder because this process is similar to the cloze task in BERT's pre-train process, therefore by using the ability of the contextual language model the decoder can generate more fluent and natural sequences.\nThe parameters are shared between the draft decoder and refine decoder, as we find that using individual parameters the model's performance degrades a lot. The reason may be that we use teach-forcing during training, and thus the word-level refine decoder learns to predict words given all the other ground-truth words of summary. This objective is similar to the language model's pre-train objective, and is probably not enough for the decoder to learn to generate refined summaries. So in our model all decoders share the same parameters.\nResearchers usually use ROUGE as the evaluation metric for summarization, however during sequence-to-sequence model training, the objective is to maximize the log likelihood of generated sequences. This mis-match harms the model's performance, so we add a discrete objective to the model, and optimize it by introducing the policy gradient method. For example, the discrete objective for the summary draft process is as Eq. ( 21 ) shows, where $a^s$ is the draft summary sampled from predicted distribution, and $R(a^s)$ is the reward score compared with the ground-truth summary, we use ROUGE-L in our experiment. To balance between optimizing the discrete objective and generating readable sequences, we mix the discrete objective with maximum-likelihood objective. As Eq. () shows, minimizing $\\hat{L}_{dec}$ is the final objective for the draft process, note here $L_{dec}$ is $-logP(a|x)$ . In the refine process we introduce similar objectives.\n$$L^{rl}_{dec} = R(a^s)\\cdot [-\\log (P(a^s|x))]  \\\\ \\hat{L}_{dec} = \\gamma * L^{rl}_{dec} + (1 - \\gamma ) * L_{dec} $$   (Eq. 21)\nLearning and Inference\nDuring model training, the objective of our model is sum of the two processes, jointly trained using \"teacher-forcing\" algorithm. During training we feed the ground-truth summary to each decoder and minimize the objective.\n$$L_{model} = \\hat{L}_{dec} + \\hat{L}_{refine}$$   (Eq. 23)\nAt test time, each time step we choose the predicted word by $\\hat{y} = argmax_{y^{\\prime }} P(y^{\\prime }|x)$ , use beam search to generate the draft summaries, and use greedy search to generate the refined summaries.\nSettings\nIn this work, all of our models are built on $BERT_{BASE}$ , although another larger pre-trained model with better performance ( $BERT_{LARGE}$ ) has published but it costs too much time and GPU memory. We use WordPiece embeddings with a 30,000 vocabulary which is the same as BERT. We set the layer of transformer decoders to 12(8 on NYT50), and set the attention heads number to 12(8 on NYT50), set fully-connected sub-layer hidden size to 3072. We train the model using an Adam optimizer with learning rate of $3e-4$ , $\\beta _1=0.9$ , $\\beta _2=0.999$ and $\\epsilon =10^{-9}$ and use a dynamic learning rate during the training process. For regularization, we use dropout BIBREF13 and label smoothing BIBREF14 in our models and set the dropout rate to 0.15, and the label smoothing value to 0.1. We set the RL objective factor $\\gamma $ to 0.99.\nDuring training, we set the batch size to 36, and train for 4 epochs(8 epochs for NYT50 since it has many fewer training samples), after training the best model are selected from last 10 models based on development set performance. Due to GPU memory limit, we use gradient accumulation, set accumulate step to 12 and feed 3 samples at each step. We use beam size 4 and length penalty of 1.0 to generate logical form sequences.\nWe filter repeated tri-grams in beam-search process by setting word probability to zero if it will generate an tri-gram which exists in the existing summary. It is a nice method to avoid phrase repetition since the two datasets seldom contains repeated tri-grams in one summary. We also fine tune the generated sequences using another two simple rules. When there are multi summary sentences with exactly the same content, we keep the first one and remove the other sentences; we also remove sentences with less than 3 words from the result.\nTo evaluate the performance of our model, we conduct experiments on CNN/Daily Mail dataset, which is a large collection of news articles and modified for summarization. Following BIBREF0 we choose the non-anonymized version of the dataset, which consists of more than 280,000 training samples and 11490 test set samples.\nWe also conduct experiments on the New York Times(NYT) dataset which also consists of many news articles. The original dataset can be applied here. In our experiment, we follow the dataset splits and other pre-process settings of BIBREF15 . We first filter all samples without a full article text or abstract and then remove all samples with summaries shorter than 50 words. Then we choose the test set based on the date of publication(all examples published after January 1, 2007). The final dataset contains 22,000 training samples and 3,452 test samples and is called NYT50 since all summaries are longer than 50 words.\nWe tokenize all sequences of the two datasets using the WordPiece tokenizer. After tokenizing, the average article length and summary length of CNN/Daily Mail are 691 and 51, and NYT50's average article length and summary length are 1152 and 75. We truncate the article length to 512, and the summary length to 100 in our experiment(max summary length is set to 150 on NYT50 as its average golden summary length is longer).\nOn CNN/Daily Mail dataset, we report the full-length F-1 score of the ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L metrics, calculated using PyRouge package and the Porter stemmer option. On NYT50, following BIBREF4 we evaluate limited length ROUGE recall score(limit the generated summary length to the ground truth length). We split NYT50 summaries into sentences by semicolons to calculate the ROUGE scores.\nResults and Analysis\nTable 1 shows the results on CNN/Daily Mail dataset, we compare the performance of many recent approaches with our model. We classify them to two groups based on whether they are extractive or abstractive models. As the last line of the table shows, the ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 score of our full model is comparable with DCA, and outperforms on ROUGE-L. Also, compared to extractive models NeuSUM and MASK- $LM^{global}$ , we achieve slight higher ROUGE-1. Except the four scores, our model outperforms these models on all the other scores, and since we have 95% confidence interval of at most $\\pm $ 0.20, these improvements are statistically significant.\nAs the last four lines of Table 1 show, we conduct an ablation study on our model variants to analyze the importance of each component. We use three ablation models for the experiments. One-Stage: A sequence-to-sequence model with copy mechanism based on BERT; Two-Stage: Adding the word-refine decoder to the One-Stage model; Two-Stage + RL: Full model with refine process cooperated with RL objective.\nFirst, we compare the Two-Stage+RL model with Two-Stage ablation, we observe that the full model outperforms by 0.30 on average ROUGE, suggesting that the reinforcement objective helps the model effectively. Then we analyze the effect of refine process by removing word-level refine from the Two-Stage model, we observe that without the refine process the average ROUGE score drops by 1.69. The ablation study shows that each module is necessary for our full model, and the improvements are statistically significant on all metrics.\nTo evaluate the impact of summary length on model performance, we compare the average rouge score improvements of our model with different length of ground-truth summaries. As the above sub-figure of Figure 2 shows, compared to Pointer-Generator with Coverage, on length interval 40-80(occupies about 70% of test set) the improvements of our model are higher than shorter samples, confirms that with better context representations, in longer documents our model can achieve higher performance.\nAs the below sub-figure of Figure 2 shows, compared to extractive baseline: Lead-3 BIBREF0 , the advantage of our model will fall when golden summary length is greater than 80. This probably because that we truncate the long documents and golden summaries and cannot get full information, it could also because that the training data in these intervals is too few to train an abstractive model, so simple extractive method will not fall too far behind.\nAdditional Results on NYT50\nTable 2 shows experiments on the NYT50 corpus. Since the short summary samples are filtered, NYT50 has average longer summaries than CNN/Daily Mail. So the model needs to catch long-term dependency of the sequences to generate good summaries.\nThe first two lines of Table 2 show results of the two baselines introduced by BIBREF15 : these baselines select first n sentences, or select the first k words from the original document. Also we compare performance of our model with two recent models, we see 2.39 ROUGE-1 improvements compared to the ML+RL with intra-attn approach(previous SOTA) carries over to this dataset, which is a large margin. On ROUGE-2, our model also get an improvement of 0.51. The experiment proves that our approach can outperform competitive methods on different data distributions.\nPre-trained language models\nPre-trained word vectors BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 have been widely used in many NLP tasks. More recently, pre-trained language models (ELMo, GPT and BERT), have also achieved great success on several NLP problems such as textual entailment, semantic similarity, reading comprehension, and question answering BIBREF20 , BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 .\nSome recent works also focus on leveraging pre-trained language models in summarization. BIBREF23 pretrain a language model and use it as the sentiment analyser when generating reviews of goods. BIBREF24 train a language model on golden summaries, and then use it on the decoder side to incorporate prior knowledge.\nIn this work, we use BERT(which is a pre-trained language model using large scale unlabeled data) on the encoder and decoder of a seq2seq model, and by designing a two stage decoding structure we build a competitive model for abstractive text summarization.\nConclusion and Future Work\nIn this work, we propose a two-stage model based on sequence-to-sequence paradigm. Our model utilize BERT on both encoder and decoder sides, and introduce reinforce objective in learning process. We evaluate our model on two benchmark datasets CNN/Daily Mail and New York Times, the experimental results show that compared to previous systems our approach effectively improves performance.\nAlthough our experiments are conducted on summarization task, our model can be used in most natural language generation tasks, such as machine translation, question generation and paraphrasing. The refine decoder and mixed objective can also be applied on other sequence generation tasks, and we will investigate on them in future work.\n\n Answer the question based on the above article as concisely as you can, using a single phrase or sentence if possible.

While well-suited to dealing with relatively short sequences, Transformers suffer from a major issue that hinders their applicability in classification of long sequences, i.e. they are able to consume only a limited context of symbols as their input BIBREF2.\nThere are several natural language (NLP) processing tasks that involve such long sequences. Of particular interest are topic identification of spoken conversations BIBREF3, BIBREF4, BIBREF5 and call center customer satisfaction prediction BIBREF6, BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9. Call center conversations, while usually quite short and to the point, often involve agents trying to solve very complex issues that the customers experience, resulting in some calls taking even an hour or more. For speech analytics purposes, these calls are typically transcribed using an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, and processed in textual representations further down the NLP pipeline. These transcripts sometimes exceed the length of 5000 words. Furthermore, temporal information might play an important role in tasks like CSAT. For example, a customer may be angry at the beginning of the call, but after her issue is resolved, she would be very satisfied with the way it was handled. Therefore, simple bag of words models, or any model that does not include temporal dependencies between the inputs, may not be well-suited to handle this category of tasks. This motivates us to employ model such as BERT in this task.\nIn this paper, we propose a method that builds upon BERT's architecture. We split the input text sequence into shorter segments in order to obtain a representation for each of them using BERT. Then, we use either a recurrent LSTM BIBREF10 network, or another Transformer, to perform the actual classification. We call these techniques Recurrence over BERT (RoBERT) and Transformer over BERT (ToBERT). Given that these models introduce a hierarchy of representations (segment-wise and document-wise), we refer to them as Hierarchical Transformers. To the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been done before to use the Transformer architecture for classification of such long sequences.\nOur novel contributions are:\nTwo extensions - RoBERT and ToBERT - to the BERT model, which enable its application in classification of long texts by performing segmentation and using another layer on top of the segment representations.\nState-of-the-art results on the Fisher topic classification task.\nSignificant improvement on the CSAT prediction task over the MS-CNN model.\nRelated work\nSeveral dimensionality reduction algorithms such as RBM, autoencoders, subspace multinomial models (SMM) are used to obtain a low dimensional representation of documents from a simple BOW representation and then classify it using a simple linear classifiers BIBREF11, BIBREF12, BIBREF13, BIBREF4. In BIBREF14 hierarchical attention networks are used for document classification. They evaluate their model on several datasets with average number of words around 150. Character-level CNN are explored in BIBREF15 but it is prohibitive for very long documents. In BIBREF16, dataset collected from arXiv papers is used for classification. For classification, they sample random blocks of words and use them together for classification instead of using full document which may work well as arXiv papers are usually coherent and well written on a well defined topic. Their method may not work well on spoken conversations as random block of words usually do not represent topic of full conversation.\nSeveral researchers addressed the problem of predicting customer satisfaction BIBREF6, BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9. In most of these works, logistic regression, SVM, CNN are applied on different kinds of representations.\nIn BIBREF17, authors use BERT for document classification but the average document length is less than BERT maximum length 512. TransformerXL BIBREF2 is an extension to the Transformer architecture that allows it to better deal with long inputs for the language modelling task. It relies on the auto-regressive property of the model, which is not the case in our tasks.\nMethod ::: BERT\nBecause our work builds heavily upon BERT, we provide a brief summary of its features. BERT is built upon the Transformer architecture BIBREF0, which uses self-attention, feed-forward layers, residual connections and layer normalization as the main building blocks. It has two pre-training objectives:\nMasked language modelling - some of the words in a sentence are being masked and the model has to predict them based on the context (note the difference from the typical autoregressive language model training objective);\nNext sentence prediction - given two input sequences, decide whether the second one is the next sentence or not.\nBERT has been shown to beat the state-of-the-art performance on 11 tasks with no modifications to the model architecture, besides adding a task-specific output layer BIBREF1. We follow same procedure suggested in BIBREF1 for our tasks. Fig. FIGREF8 shows the BERT model for classification. We obtain two kinds of representation from BERT: pooled output from last transformer block, denoted by H, and posterior probabilities, denoted by P. There are two variants of BERT - BERT-Base and BERT-Large. In this work we are using BERT-Base for faster training and experimentation, however, our methods are applicable to BERT-Large as well. BERT-Base and BERT-Large are different in model parameters such as number of transformer blocks, number of self-attention heads. Total number of parameters in BERT-Base are 110M and 340M in BERT-Large.\nBERT suffers from major limitations in terms of handling long sequences. Firstly, the self-attention layer has a quadratic complexity $O(n^2)$ in terms of the sequence length $n$ BIBREF0. Secondly, BERT uses a learned positional embeddings scheme BIBREF1, which means that it won't likely be able to generalize to positions beyond those seen in the training data.\nTo investigate the effect of fine-tuning BERT on task performance, we use either the pre-trained BERT weights, or the weights from a BERT fine-tuned on the task-specific dataset on a segment-level (i.e. we preserve the original label but fine-tune on each segment separately instead of on the whole text sequence). We compare these results to using the fine-tuned segment-level BERT predictions directly as inputs to the next layer.\nMethod ::: Recurrence over BERT\nGiven that BERT is limited to a particular input length, we split the input sequence into segments of a fixed size with overlap. For each of these segments, we obtain H or P from BERT model. We then stack these segment-level representations into a sequence, which serves as input to a small (100-dimensional) LSTM layer. Its output serves as a document embedding. Finally, we use two fully connected layers with ReLU (30-dimensional) and softmax (the same dimensionality as the number of classes) activations to obtain the final predictions.\nWith this approach, we overcome BERT's computational complexity, reducing it to $O(n/k * k^2) = O(nk)$ for RoBERT, with $k$ denoting the segment size (the LSTM component has negligible linear complexity $O(k)$). The positional embeddings are also no longer an issue.\nMethod ::: Transformer over BERT\nGiven that Transformers' edge over recurrent networks is their ability to effectively capture long distance relationships between words in a sequence BIBREF0, we experiment with replacing the LSTM recurrent layer in favor of a small Transformer model (2 layers of transformer building block containing self-attention, fully connected, etc.). To investigate if preserving the information about the input sequence order is important, we also build a variant of ToBERT which learns positional embeddings at the segment-level representations (but is limited to sequences of length seen during the training).\nToBERT's computational complexity $O(\\frac{n^2}{k^2})$ is asymptotically inferior to RoBERT, as the top-level Transformer model again suffers from quadratic complexity in the number of segments. However, in practice this number is much smaller than the input sequence length (${\\frac{n}{k}} << n$), so we haven't observed performance or memory issues with our datasets.\nExperiments\nWe evaluated our models on 3 different datasets:\nCSAT dataset for CSAT prediction, consisting of spoken transcripts (automatic via ASR).\n20 newsgroups for topic identification task, consisting of written text;\nFisher Phase 1 corpus for topic identification task, consisting of spoken transcripts (manual);\nExperiments ::: CSAT\nCSAT dataset consists of US English telephone speech from call centers. For each call in this dataset, customers participated in that call gave a rating on his experience with agent. Originally, this dataset has labels rated on a scale 1-9 with 9 being extremely satisfied and 1 being extremely dissatisfied. Fig. FIGREF16 shows the histogram of ratings for our dataset. As the distribution is skewed towards extremes, we choose to do binary classification with ratings above 4.5 as satisfied and below 4.5 as dissatisfied. Quantization of ratings also helped us to create a balanced dataset. This dataset contains 4331 calls and we split them into 3 sets for our experiments: 2866 calls for training, 362 calls for validation and, finally, 1103 calls for testing.\nWe obtained the transcripts by employing an ASR system. The ASR system uses TDNN-LSTM acoustic model trained on Fisher and Switchboard datasets with lattice-free maximum mutual information criterion BIBREF18. The word error rates using four-gram language models were 9.2% and 17.3% respectively on Switchboard and CallHome portions of Eval2000 dataset.\nExperiments ::: 20 newsgroups\n20 newsgroups data set is one of the frequently used datasets in the text processing community for text classification and text clustering. This data set contains approximately 20,000 English documents from 20 topics to be identified, with 11314 documents for training and 7532 for testing. In this work, we used only 90% of documents for training and the remaining 10% for validation. For fair comparison with other publications, we used 53160 words vocabulary set available in the datasets website.\nExperiments ::: Fisher\nFisher Phase 1 US English corpus is often used for automatic speech recognition in speech community. In this work, we used it for topic identification as in BIBREF3. The documents are 10-minute long telephone conversations between two people discussing a given topic. We used same training and test splits as BIBREF3 in which 1374 and 1372 documents are used for training and testing respectively. For validation of our model, we used 10% of training dataset and the remaining 90% was used for actual model training. The number of topics in this data set is 40.\nExperiments ::: Dataset Statistics\nTable TABREF22 shows statistics of our datasets. It can be observed that average length of Fisher is much higher than 20 newsgroups and CSAT. Cumulative distribution of document lengths for each dataset is shown in Fig. FIGREF21. It can be observed that almost all of the documents in Fisher dataset have length more than 1000 words. For CSAT, more than 50% of the documents have length greater than 500 and for 20newsgroups only 10% of the documents have length greater than 500. Note that, for CSAT and 20newsgroups, there are few documents with length more than 5000.\nExperiments ::: Architecture and Training Details\nIn this work, we split document into segments of 200 tokens with a shift of 50 tokens to extract features from BERT model. For RoBERT, LSTM model is trained to minimize cross-entropy loss with Adam optimizer BIBREF19. The initial learning rate is set to $0.001$ and is reduced by a factor of $0.95$ if validation loss does not decrease for 3-epochs. For ToBERT, the Transformer is trained with the default BERT version of Adam optimizer BIBREF1 with an initial learning rate of $5e$-5. We report accuracy in all of our experiments. We chose a model with the best validation accuracy to calculate accuracy on the test set. To accomodate for non-determinism of some TensorFlow GPU operations, we report accuracy averaged over 5 runs.\nResults\nTable TABREF25 presents results using pre-trained BERT features. We extracted features from the pooled output of final transformer block as these were shown to be working well for most of the tasks BIBREF1. The features extracted from a pre-trained BERT model without any fine-tuning lead to a sub-par performance. However, We also notice that ToBERT model exploited the pre-trained BERT features better than RoBERT. It also converged faster than RoBERT. Table TABREF26 shows results using features extracted after fine-tuning BERT model with our datasets. Significant improvements can be observed compared to using pre-trained BERT features. Also, it can be noticed that ToBERT outperforms RoBERT on Fisher and 20newsgroups dataset by 13.63% and 0.81% respectively. On CSAT, ToBERT performs slightly worse than RoBERT but it is not statistically significant as this dataset is small.\nTable TABREF27 presents results using fine-tuned BERT predictions instead of the pooled output from final transformer block. For each document, having obtained segment-wise predictions we can obtain final prediction for the whole document in three ways:\nCompute the average of all segment-wise predictions and find the most probable class;\nFind the most frequently predicted class;\nTrain a classification model.\nIt can be observed from Table TABREF27 that a simple averaging operation or taking most frequent predicted class works competitively for CSAT and 20newsgroups but not for the Fisher dataset. We believe the improvements from using RoBERT or ToBERT, compared to simple averaging or most frequent operations, are proportional to the fraction of long documents in the dataset. CSAT and 20newsgroups have (on average) significantly shorter documents than Fisher, as seen in Fig. FIGREF21. Also, significant improvements for Fisher could be because of less confident predictions from BERT model as this dataset has 40 classes. Fig. FIGREF31 presents the comparison of average voting and ToBERT for various document length ranges for Fisher dataset. We used fine-tuned BERT segment-level predictions (P) for this analysis. It can be observed that ToBERT outperforms average voting in every interval. To the best of our knowledge, this is a state-of-the-art result reported on the Fisher dataset.\nTable TABREF32 presents the effect of position embeddings on the model performance. It can be observed that position embeddings did not significantly affect the model performance for Fisher and 20newsgroups, but they helped slightly in CSAT prediction (an absolute improvement of 0.64% F1-score). We think that this is explained by the fact that Fisher and 20newsgroups are topic identification tasks, and the topic does not change much throughout these documents. However, CSAT may vary during the call, and in some cases a naive assumption that the sequential nature of the transcripts is irrelevant may lead to wrong conclusions.\nTable TABREF33 compares our results with previous works. It can be seen that our model ToBERT outperforms CNN based experiments by significant margin on CSAT and Fisher datasets. For CSAT dataset, we used multi-scale CNN (MS-CNN) as the baseline, given its strong results on Fisher and 20newsgroups. The setup was replicated from BIBREF5 for comparison. We also see that our result on 20 newsgroups is 0.6% worse than the state-of-the-art.\nConclusions\nIn this paper, we presented two methods for long documents using BERT model: RoBERT and ToBERT. We evaluated our experiments on two classification tasks - customer satisfaction prediction and topic identification - using 3 datasets: CSAT, 20newsgroups and Fisher. We observed that ToBERT outperforms RoBERT on pre-trained BERT features and fine-tuned BERT features for all our tasks. Also, we noticed that fine-tuned BERT performs better than pre-trained BERT. We have shown that both RoBERT and ToBERT improved the simple baselines of taking an average (or the most frequent) of segment-wise predictions for long documents to obtain final prediction. Position embeddings did not significantly affect our models performance, but slightly improved the accuracy on the CSAT task. We obtained the best results on Fisher dataset and good improvements for CSAT task compared to the CNN baseline. It is interesting to note that the longer the average input in a given task, the bigger improvement we observe w.r.t. the baseline for that task. Our results confirm that both RoBERT and ToBERT can be used for long sequences with competitive performance and quick fine-tuning procedure. For future work, we shall focus on training models on long documents directly (i.e. in an end-to-end manner).\n\n Answer the question based on the above article as concisely as you can, using a single phrase or sentence if possible.

A series of faster approximations, such as naive mean-field, independent-pair approximation \\cite{Roudi09a, Roudi09b}, inversion of TAP equations \\cite{Kappen98,Tanaka98}, small correlations expansion \\cite{Sessak09}, adaptive TAP \\cite{Opper01}, adaptive  cluster expansion \\cite{Cocco12} or Bethe approximations \\cite{Ricci-Tersenghi12, Nguyen12}  have, then, been developed. These techniques take as input means and correlations of observed variables and most of them assume a fully connected graph as underlying connectivity network, or expand  around it by perturbative dilution.  In most cases, network reconstruction turns out to  be not accurate for small data sizes and/or when couplings are  strong or, else, if the original interaction network is sparse.\\\\\n\\indent\n A further method, substantially improving performances for small data, is the so-called Pseudo-Likelyhood Method (PLM) \\cite{Ravikumar10}. In Ref. \\cite{Aurell12} Aurell and Ekeberg performed a comparison between PLM and some of the just mentioned mean-field-based algorithms on the pairwise interacting Ising-spin  ($\\sigma = \\pm 1$) model, showing how PLM performs sensitively better, especially on sparse graphs and in the high-coupling limit, i.e., for low temperature.\n \n In this work, we aim at performing statistical inference  on a model whose interacting variables are continuous $XY$ spins, i.e., $\\sigma \\equiv \\left(\\cos \\phi,\\sin \\phi\\right)$ with $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi )$. The developed tools can, actually, be also straightforward applied  to the $p$-clock model  \\cite{Potts52} where the phase $\\phi$ takes discretely equispaced $p$ values  in the $2 \\pi$ interval, $\\phi_a =  a 2 \\pi/p$, with $a= 0,1,\\dots,p-1$. The $p$-clock model, else called vector Potts model, gives a hierarchy of discretization of the $XY$ model as $p$ increases. For $p=2$, one recovers the Ising model, for $p=4$ the Ashkin-Teller model \\cite{Ashkin43}, for $p=6$ the ice-type model \\cite{Pauling35,Baxter82} and the eight-vertex model \\cite{Sutherland70,Fan70,Baxter71} for $p=8$.  \nIt turns out to be very useful also for numerical implementations of the continuous $XY$ model. \nRecent analysis on the multi-body $XY$ model has shown that for a limited number of discrete phase values ($p\\sim 16, 32$) the thermodynamic critical properties of the $p\\to\\infty$ $XY$ limit are promptly recovered \\cite{Marruzzo15, Marruzzo16}.  \nOur main motivation to study statistical inference is that these kind of models have recently turned out to be rather useful in describing the behavior of optical systems, \nincluding standard mode-locking lasers \\cite{Gordon02,Gat04,Angelani07,Marruzzo15} and random lasers \\cite{Angelani06a,Leuzzi09a,Antenucci15a,Antenucci15b,Marruzzo16}. \nIn particular, the inverse problem on the pairwise XY model analyzed here might be of help in recovering images from light propagated through random media. \n\n\n      This paper is organized as follows: in Sec. \\ref{sec:model} we introduce the general model  and we discuss its  derivation also  as a model for light transmission through random scattering media. \n    In Sec. \\ref{sec:plm} we introduce the PLM with $l_2$ regularization  and with decimation, two variants of the PLM respectively introduced in Ref. \\cite{Wainwright06} and \\cite{Aurell12} for the inverse Ising problem. \n    Here, we analyze these techniques for continuous $XY$ spins and we test them on thermalized data generated by Exchange Monte Carlo numerical simulations of the original model dynamics. In Sec. \\ref{sec:res_reg} we  present the results related to the PLM-$l_2$. In Sec. \\ref{sec:res_dec} the results related to the PLM with decimation are reported and its performances are compared to the PLM-$l_2$ and to a variational mean-field method analyzed in Ref. \\cite{Tyagi15}. In Sec. \\ref{sec:conc}, we outline conclusive remarks and perspectives.\n\n        \\section{The leading $XY$ model}\n      \\label{sec:model}\n The leading model we are considering is defined, for a system of $N$ angular $XY$ variables, by the Hamiltonian \n \\begin{equation}\n  \\mathcal{H} = - \\sum_{ik}^{1,N} J_{ik} \\cos{\\left(\\phi_i-\\phi_k\\right)} \n  \\label{eq:HXY}\n \n  \\end{equation} \n  \n  The $XY$ model is well known in statistical mechanics, displaying important physical\n  insights, starting from the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\n  transition in two dimensions\\cite{Berezinskii70,Berezinskii71,Kosterlitz72} and moving to, e.g., the\n  transition of liquid helium to its superfluid state \\cite{Brezin82}, the roughening transition of the interface of a crystal in equilibrium with its vapor \\cite{Cardy96}. In presence of disorder and frustration \\cite{Villain77,Fradkin78} the model has been adopted to describe synchronization problems as the Kuramoto model \\cite{Kuramoto75} and in the theoretical modeling of Josephson junction arrays \\cite{Teitel83a,Teitel83b} and arrays of coupled lasers \\cite{Nixon13}.\n  Besides several derivations and implementations of the model in quantum and classical physics, equilibrium or out of equilibrium, ordered or fully frustrated systems, Eq. (\\ref{eq:HXY}), in its generic form,\n  has found applications also in other fields. A rather fascinating example being the behavior of starlings flocks  \\cite{Reynolds87,Deneubourg89,Huth90,Vicsek95, Cavagna13}.\n  Our interest on the $XY$ model resides, though, in optics. Phasor and phase models with pairwise and  multi-body interaction terms can, indeed, describe the behavior of electromagnetic modes in both linear and nonlinear optical systems in the analysis of problems such as light propagation and lasing \\cite{Gordon02, Antenucci15c, Antenucci15d}. As couplings are strongly frustrated, these models turn out to be especially useful to the study of optical properties in random media \\cite{Antenucci15a,Antenucci15b}, as in the noticeable case of random lasers \\cite{Wiersma08,Andreasen11,Antenucci15e}  and they might as well be applied to linear scattering problems, e.g., propagation of waves in opaque systems or disordered fibers. \n  \n  \n  \\subsection{A propagating wave model}\n  We briefly mention a derivation of the model as a proxy for the propagation of light through random linear media. \n Scattering of light is held responsible to obstruct our view and make objects opaque. Light rays, once that they enter the material, only exit  after getting scattered multiple times within the material. In such a disordered medium, both the direction and the phase of the propagating waves are random. Transmitted light \n yields a disordered interference pattern typically  having low intensity, random phase and almost no resolution, called a speckle. Nevertheless, in recent years it has been realized that disorder is rather a blessing in disguise \\cite{Vellekoop07,Vellekoop08a,Vellekoop08b}. Several experiments have made it possible to control the behavior of light and other optical processes in a given random disordered medium,  \n by exploiting, e.g.,  the tools developed for wavefront shaping to control the propagation of light and to engineer the confinement of light \\cite{Yilmaz13,Riboli14}.\n \\\\\n \\indent\n In a linear dielectric medium, light propagation can be described through a part of the scattering matrix, the transmission matrix $\\mathbb{T}$, linking the outgoing to the incoming fields. \n Consider the case in which there are $N_I$ incoming channels and $N_O$ outgoing ones; we can indicate with $E^{\\rm in,out}_k$ the input/output electromagnetic field phasors of channel $k$. In the most general case, i.e., without making any particular assumptions on the field polarizations, each light mode and its polarization polarization state can be represented by means of the $4$-dimensional Stokes vector. Each $ t_{ki}$ element of $\\mathbb{T}$, thus, is a $4 \\times 4$ M{\\\"u}ller matrix. If, on the other hand, we know that the source is polarized and the observation is made on the same polarization, one can use a scalar model and adopt Jones calculus \\cite{Goodman85,Popoff10a,Akbulut11}:\n   \\begin{eqnarray}\n E^{\\rm out}_k = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_I}  t_{ki} E^{\\rm in}_i \\qquad \\forall~ k=1,\\ldots,N_O\n \\label{eq:transm}\n \\end{eqnarray}\n  We recall that the elements of the transmission matrix are random complex coefficients\\cite{Popoff10a}. For the case of completely unpolarized modes, we can also use a scalar model similar to Eq. \\eqref{eq:transm}, but whose variables are  the intensities of the outgoing/incoming fields, rather than the fields themselves.\\\\ \nIn the following, for simplicity, we will consider Eq. (\\ref{eq:transm}) as our starting point,\nwhere $E^{\\rm out}_k$, $E^{\\rm in}_i$ and $t_{ki}$ are all complex scalars. \nIf Eq. \\eqref{eq:transm} holds for any $k$, we can write:\n  \\begin{eqnarray}\n  \\int \\prod_{k=1}^{N_O} dE^{\\rm out}_k \\prod_{k=1}^{N_O}\\delta\\left(E^{\\rm out}_k - \\sum_{j=1}^{N_I}  t_{kj} E^{\\rm in}_j \\right) = 1\n  \\nonumber\n  \\\\\n  \\label{eq:deltas}\n  \\end{eqnarray}\n\n Observed data are a noisy representation of the true values of the fields. Therefore, in inference problems it is statistically more meaningful to take that noise into account in a probabilistic way, \n rather than looking  at the precise solutions of the exact equations (whose parameters are unknown). \n To this aim we can introduce Gaussian distributions whose limit for zero variance are the Dirac deltas in Eq. (\\ref{eq:deltas}).\n Moreover, we move to consider the ensemble of all possible solutions of Eq. (\\ref{eq:transm}) at given $\\mathbb{T}$, looking at  all configurations of input fields. We, thus, define the function:\n \n   \\begin{eqnarray}\n  Z &\\equiv &\\int_{{\\cal S}_{\\rm in}} \\prod_{j=1}^{N_I}  dE^{\\rm in}_j \\int_{{\\cal S}_{\\rm out}}\\prod_{k=1}^{N_O} dE^{\\rm out}_k \n  \\label{def:Z}\n\\\\\n    \\times\n  &&\\prod_{k=1}^{N_O}\n   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\Delta^2}}  \\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{1}{2 \\Delta^2}\\left|\n  E^{\\rm out}_k -\\sum_{j=1}^{N_I}  t_{kj} E^{\\rm in}_j\\right|^2\n\\right\\} \n\\nonumber\n \\end{eqnarray}\n   We stress that the integral of Eq. \\eqref{def:Z} is not exactly a Gaussian integral. Indeed, starting from Eq. \\eqref{eq:deltas}, two constraints on the electromagnetic field intensities must be taken into account. \n\n  The space of solutions is  delimited by the total power ${\\cal P}$ received by system, i.e., \n  ${\\cal S}_{\\rm in}: \\{E^{\\rm in} |\\sum_k I^{\\rm in}_k = \\mathcal{P}\\}$, also implying  a constraint on the total amount of energy that is transmitted through the medium, i. e., \n  ${\\cal S}_{\\rm out}:\\{E^{\\rm out} |\\sum_k I^{\\rm out}_k=c\\mathcal{P}\\}$, where the attenuation factor  $c<1$ accounts for total losses.\n  As we will see more in details in the following, being interested in inferring the transmission matrix through the PLM, we can omit to explicitly include these terms in Eq. \\eqref{eq:H_J} since they do not depend on $\\mathbb{T}$ not adding any information on the gradients with respect to the elements of $\\mathbb{T}$.\n  \n Taking the same number of incoming and outcoming channels, $N_I=N_O=N/2$, and  ordering the input fields in the first $N/2$ mode indices and the output fields in the last $N/2$ indices, we can drop the ``in'' and ``out'' superscripts and formally write $Z$  as a partition function\n    \\begin{eqnarray}\n        \\label{eq:z}\n && Z =\\int_{\\mathcal S} \\prod_{j=1}^{N} dE_j \\left(   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\Delta^2}} \\right)^{N/2} \n \\hspace*{-.4cm} \\exp\\left\\{\n  -\\frac{ {\\cal H} [\\{E\\};\\mathbb{T}] }{2\\Delta^2}\n  \\right\\}\n  \\\\\n&&{\\cal H} [\\{E\\};\\mathbb{T}] =\n-  \\sum_{k=1}^{N/2}\\sum_{j=N/2+1}^{N} \\left[E^*_j t_{jk} E_k + E_j t^*_{kj} E_k^* \n\\right]\n \\nonumber\n\\\\\n&&\\qquad\\qquad \\qquad + \\sum_{j=N/2+1}^{N} |E_j|^2+ \\sum_{k,l}^{1,N/2}E_k\nU_{kl} E_l^*\n \\nonumber\n \\\\\n \\label{eq:H_J}\n &&\\hspace*{1.88cm } = - \\sum_{nm}^{1,N} E_n J_{nm} E_m^*\n \\end{eqnarray}\n where ${\\cal H}$ is a real-valued function by construction, we have introduced the effective input-input coupling matrix\n\\begin{equation}\nU_{kl} \\equiv \\sum_{j=N/2+1}^{N}t^*_{lj} t_{jk} \n \\label{def:U}\n \\end{equation}\n and the whole interaction matrix reads (here $\\mathbb{T} \\equiv \\{ t_{jk} \\}$)\n \\begin{equation}\n \\label{def:J}\n \\mathbb J\\equiv \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc|ccc}\n \\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}\\\\\n \\phantom{()}&-\\mathbb{U} \\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&{\\mathbb{T}}&\\phantom{()}\\\\\n\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}\\\\\n \\hline\n\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}\\\\\n \\phantom{()}& \\mathbb   T^\\dagger&\\phantom{()}&\\phantom{()}& - \\mathbb{I} &\\phantom{()}\\\\\n\\phantom{a}&\\phantom{a}&\\phantom{a}&\\phantom{a}&\\phantom{a}&\\phantom{a}\\\\\n \\end{array}\\right)\n \\end{equation}\n \n Determining the electromagnetic complex amplitude configurations that minimize the {\\em cost function} ${\\cal H}$, Eq.  (\\ref{eq:H_J}),  means to maximize the overall distribution peaked around the solutions of the transmission Eqs. (\\ref{eq:transm}). As the variance $\\Delta^2\\to 0$, eventually, the initial set of Eqs. (\\ref{eq:transm}) are recovered. The ${\\cal H}$ function, thus, plays the role of an Hamiltonian and  $\\Delta^2$ the role of a noise-inducing temperature. The exact numerical problem corresponds to the zero temperature limit of the statistical mechanical problem. Working with real data, though, which are noisy, a finite ``temperature''\n  allows for a better representation of the ensemble of solutions to the sets of equations of continuous variables. \n  \n\n  \n  \n  Now, we can express every phasor in Eq. \\eqref{eq:z}  as $E_k = A_k e^{\\imath \\phi_k}$. As a working hypothesis we will consider the intensities $A_k^2$ as either homogeneous or as \\textit{quenched} with respect to phases.\nThe first condition occurs, for instance, to the input intensities $|E^{\\rm in}_k|$ produced by a phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) with homogeneous illumination \\cite{Popoff11}.\nWith \\textit{quenched} here we mean, instead, that the intensity of each mode is the same for every solution of Eq. \\eqref{eq:transm} at fixed $\\mathbb T$.\nWe stress that, including intensities in the model does not preclude the inference analysis but it is out of the focus of the present work and will be considered elsewhere. \n\nIf all intensities are uniform in input and in output, this amount to a constant rescaling for each one of the four sectors of matrix $\\mathbb J$ in Eq. (\\ref{def:J}) that will not change the properties of the matrices.\nFor instance, if the original transmission matrix is unitary, so it will be the rescaled one and the matrix $\\mathbb U$ will be  diagonal.\nOtherwise, if intensities are \\textit{quenched}, i.e., they can be considered as constants in Eq. (\\ref{eq:transm}),\nthey are inhomogeneous with respect to phases. The generic Hamiltonian element will, therefore, rescale as \n  \\begin{eqnarray}\n  E^*_n J_{nm} E_m = J_{nm} A_n A_m e^{\\imath (\\phi_n-\\phi_m)} \\to J_{nm} e^{\\imath (\\phi_n-\\phi_m)}\n  \\nonumber\n  \\end{eqnarray}\n  and the properties of the original  $J_{nm}$ components are not conserved  in the rescaled one. In particular, we have no argument, anymore, to possibly set the rescaled $U_{nm}\\propto \\delta_{nm}$.\n  Eventually, we end up with the complex couplings $XY$ model, whose real-valued Hamiltonian is written as\n \\begin{eqnarray}\n  \\mathcal{H}& = &  - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{nm} J_{nm} e^{-\\imath (\\phi_n - \\phi_m)}  + \\mbox{c.c.} \n    \\label{eq:h_im}\n\\\\    &=&  - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{nm} \\left[J^R_{nm} \\cos(\\phi_n - \\phi_m)+\n  J^I_{nm}\\sin (\\phi_n - \\phi_m)\\right] \n  \\nonumber\n \\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $J_{nm}^R$ and $J_{nm}^I$ are the real and imaginary parts of $J_{nm}$.

If the intensities are fixed, then they can be incorporated in $t_{ij}$ and eq (2) can be written just for phases as described. \\\\\n}\n\\end{comment}\n\n\n  \\section{Pseudolikelihood Maximization}\n  \\label{sec:plm}\nThe inverse problem consists in the reconstruction of the parameters $J_{nm}$ of the Hamiltonian, Eq. (\\ref{eq:h_im}).  \nGiven a set of $M$ data configurations of $N$ spins\n $\\bm\\sigma = \\{ \\cos \\phi_i^{(\\mu)},\\sin \\phi_i^{(\\mu)} \\}$, $i = 1,\\dots,N$ and $\\mu=1,\\dots,M$, we want to \\emph{infer} the couplings:\n \\begin{eqnarray}\n\\bm \\sigma  \\rightarrow  \\mathbb{J} \n\\nonumber\n \\end{eqnarray}\n With this purpose in mind,\n in the rest of this section we implement the working equations for the techniques used. \n In order to test our methods, we generate the input data, i.e., the configurations, by Monte-Carlo simulations of the model.\n The joint probability distribution of the $N$ variables $\\bm{\\phi}\\equiv\\{\\phi_1,\\dots,\\phi_N\\}$, follows the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution:\n \\begin{equation}\\label{eq:p_xy}\n P(\\bm{\\phi}) = \\frac{1}{Z} e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H\\left(\\bm{\\phi}\\right)}} \\quad \\mbox{ where } \\quad Z = \\int \\prod_{k=1}^N d\\phi_k  e^{-\\beta \\mathcal{H\\left(\\bm{\\phi}\\right)}}  \n \\end{equation}\n and where we denote $\\beta=\\left( 2\\Delta^2 \\right)^{-1}$ with respect to Eq. (\\ref{def:Z}) formalism.\n In order to stick to usual statistical inference notation, in the following we will rescale the couplings by a factor $\\beta / 2$: $\\beta J_{ij}/2 \\rightarrow J_{ij}$. \n The main idea of the PLM is to work with the conditional probability distribution of one variable $\\phi_i$ given all other variables, \n $\\bm{\\phi}_{\\backslash i}$:\n \n  \\begin{eqnarray}\n\t\\nonumber\n   P(\\phi_i | \\bm{\\phi}_{\\backslash i}) &=& \\frac{1}{Z_i} \\exp \\left \\{ {H_i^x (\\bm{\\phi}_{\\backslash i})\n  \t\\cos \\phi_i + H_i^y (\\bm{\\phi}_{\\backslash i}) \\sin \\phi_i } \\right \\}\n\t\\\\\n \\label{eq:marginal_xy}\n\t&=&\\frac{e^{H_i(\\bm{\\phi}_{\\backslash i}) \\cos{\\left(\\phi_i-\\alpha_i(\\bm{\\phi}_{\\backslash i})\\right)}}}{2 \\pi I_0(H_i)}\n  \\end{eqnarray}\n  where $H_i^x$ and $H_i^y$ are defined as\n   \\begin{eqnarray}\n   H_i^x (\\bm{\\phi}_{\\backslash i})  &=& \\sum_{j (\\neq i)} J^R_{ij} \\cos \\phi_j  - \\sum_{j  (\\neq i) } J_{ij}^{I} \\sin \\phi_j \\phantom{+  h^R_i} \\label{eq:26} \\\\\n   H_i^y  (\\bm{\\phi}_{\\backslash i})  &=&  \\sum_{j  (\\neq i)} J^R_{ij}  \\sin \\phi_j  + \\sum_{j  (\\neq i) } J_{ij}^{I}   \\cos \\phi_j \\phantom{ + h_i^{I} }\\label{eq:27}\n   \\end{eqnarray}\nand $H_i= \\sqrt{(H_i^x)^2 + (H_i^y)^2}$, $\\alpha_i = \\arctan H_i^y/H_i^x$   and we introduced the modified Bessel function of the first kind:\n  \\begin{equation}\n  \\nonumber\n   I_k(x) = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi}\\int_{0}^{2 \\pi} d \\phi e^{x \\cos{ \\phi}}\\cos{k \\phi}\n  \\end{equation}\n  \n   Given $M$ observation samples $\\bm{\\phi}^{(\\mu)}=\\{\\phi^\\mu_1,\\ldots,\\phi^\\mu_N\\}$, $\\mu = 1,\\dots, M$, the\n   pseudo-loglikelihood for the variable $i$ is given by the logarithm of Eq. (\\ref{eq:marginal_xy}),\n   \\begin{eqnarray}\n   \\label{eq:L_i}\n   L_i &=& \\frac{1}{M}  \\sum_{\\mu = 1}^M  \\ln P(\\phi_i^{(\\mu)}|\\bm{\\phi}^{(\\mu)}_{\\backslash i})\n   \\\\\n   \\nonumber\n   & =&  \\frac{1}{M}  \\sum_{\\mu = 1}^M  \\left[ H_i^{(\\mu)} \\cos( \\phi_i^{(\\mu)} - \\alpha_i^{(\\mu)}) - \\ln  2 \\pi I_0\\left(H_i^{(\\mu)}\\right)\\right] \\, .\n    \\end{eqnarray}\nThe underlying idea of PLM is that an approximation of the true parameters of the model is obtained for values that maximize the functions $L_i$.\nThe specific maximization scheme differentiates the different techniques.\n\n\n   \n   \n   \\subsection{PLM with $l_2$ regularization}\n   Especially for the case of sparse graphs, it is useful to add a regularizer, which prevents the maximization routine to move towards high values of \n   $J_{ij}$ and $h_i$ without converging. We will adopt an $l_2$ regularization so that the Pseudolikelihood function (PLF) at site $i$  reads:\n   \\begin{equation}\\label{eq:plf_i}\n  {\\cal L}_i = L_i\n  - \\lambda \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\left(J_{ij}^R\\right)^2 - \\lambda \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\left(J_{ij}^I\\right)^2  \n   \\end{equation}\n   with $\\lambda>0$.\n   Note that the values of $\\lambda$ have to be chosen arbitrarily, but not too large, in order not to overcome $L_i$.\n   The standard implementation of the PLM consists in maximizing each ${\\cal L}_i$, for $i=1\\dots N$, separately. The expected values of the couplings are then:\n   \\begin{equation}\n   \\{ J_{i j}^*\\}_{j\\in \\partial i} :=  \\mbox{arg max}_{ \\{ J_{ij} \\}}\n    \\left[{\\cal L}_i\\right]\n   \\end{equation}\n   In this way, we obtain two estimates for the coupling $J_{ij}$, one from maximization of ${\\cal L}_i$, $J_{ij}^{(i)}$, and another one from ${\\cal L}_j$, say $J_{ij}^{(j)}$.\n    Since the original Hamiltonian of the $XY$ model is Hermitian, we know that the real part of the couplings is symmetric while the imaginary part is skew-symmetric. \n   \n     The final estimate for $J_{ij}$ can then be obtained  averaging the two results:\n  \n  \n  \n   \\begin{equation}\\label{eq:symm}\n   J_{ij}^{\\rm inferred} = \\frac{J_{ij}^{(i)} + \\bar{J}_{ij}^{(j)}}{2} \n   \\end{equation}\n   where with $\\bar{J}$ we indicate the complex conjugate.\n   It is worth noting that the pseudolikelihood $L_i$, Eq. \\eqref{eq:L_i}, is characterized by the\n   following properties: (i) the normalization term of Eq.\\eqref{eq:marginal_xy} can be\n   computed analytically at odd with the {\\em full} likelihood case that\n   in general require a computational time which scales exponentially\n   with the size of the systems; (ii) the $\\ell_2$-regularized pseudolikelihood\n   defined in Eq.\\eqref{eq:plf_i} is strictly concave (i.e. it has a single\n   maximizer)\\cite{Ravikumar10}; (iii) it is consistent, i.e. if $M$ samples are\n   generated by a model $P(\\phi | J*)$ the maximizer tends to $J*$\n   for $M\\rightarrow\\infty$\\cite{besag1975}. Note also that (iii) guarantees that  \n   $|J^{(i)}_{ij}-J^{(j)}_{ij}| \\rightarrow 0$ for $M\\rightarrow \\infty$.\n   In Secs. \\ref{sec:res_reg}, \\ref{sec:res_dec} \n   we report the results obtained and we analyze the performances of the PLM having taken the configurations from Monte-Carlo simulations of models whose details are known.\n   \n\n   \n   \\subsection{PLM with decimation}\n   Even though the PLM with $l_2$-regularization allows to dwell the inference towards the low temperature region and in the low sampling case with better performances that mean-field methods, in some situations some couplings are overestimated and not at all symmetric. Moreover, in the technique there is the bias of the $l_2$ regularizer.\n   Trying to overcome these problems, Decelle and Ricci-Tersenghi introduced a new method \\cite{Decelle14}, known as PLM + decimation: the algorithm maximizes the sum of the $L_i$,\n   \\begin{eqnarray}\n    {\\cal L}\\equiv \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\mbox{L}_i\n    \\end{eqnarray}  \n    and, then, it recursively set to zero couplings which are estimated very small. We expect that as long as we are setting to zero couplings that are unnecessary to fit the data, there should be not much changing on ${\\cal L}$. Keeping on with decimation, a point is reached where ${\\cal L}$ decreases abruptly indicating  that relevant couplings are being decimated and under-fitting is taking place.\n   Let us define  by $x$  the fraction of non-decimated couplings. To have a quantitative measure for the halt criterion of the decimation process, a tilted ${\\cal L}$ is defined as,\n   \\begin{eqnarray}\n  \\mathcal{L}_t &\\equiv& \\mathcal{L}  - x \\mathcal{L}_{\\textup{max}} - (1-x) \\mathcal{L}_{\\textup{min}} \\label{$t$PLF} \n   \\end{eqnarray}\n   where \n   \\begin{itemize}\n   \\item $\\mathcal{L}_{\\textup{min}}$ is the pseudolikelyhood of a model with independent variables. In the XY case: $\\mathcal{L}_{\\textup{min}}=-\\ln{2 \\pi}$.\n   \\item\n   $\\mathcal{L}_{\\textup{max}}$ is the pseudolikelyhood in the fully-connected model and it is maximized over all the $N(N-1)/2$ possible couplings. \n   \\end{itemize}\n   At the first step, when $x=1$, $\\mathcal{L}$ takes value $\\mathcal{L}_{\\rm max}$ and  $\\mathcal{L}_t=0$. On the last step, for an empty graph, i.e., $x=0$, $\\mathcal{L}$ takes the value $\\mathcal{L}_{\\rm min}$ and, hence, again $\\mathcal{L}_t =0$. \n   In the intermediate steps, during the decimation procedure, as $x$ is decreasing from $1$ to $0$, one observes firstly that $\\mathcal{L}_t$ increases linearly and, then, it displays an abrupt decrease indicating that from this point on relevant couplings are being decimated\\cite{Decelle14}. In Fig. \\ref{Jor1-$t$PLF} we give an instance of this behavior for the 2D short-range XY model with ordered couplings. We notice that the maximum point of $\\mathcal{L}_t$ coincides with the minimum point of the reconstruction error, the latter defined as \n   \\begin{eqnarray}\\label{eq:errj}\n   \\mbox{err}_J \\equiv \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i<j} (J^{\\rm inferred}_{ij} -J^{\\rm true}_{ij})^2}{N(N-1)/2}} \\label{err}\n   \\end{eqnarray}\n  We stress that the ${\\cal L}_t$ maximum is obtained ignoring the underlying graph, while the err$_J$ minimum can be evaluated once the true graph has been reconstructed. \n   \n     \\begin{figure}[t!]\n   \t\\centering\n   \t\\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{Jor1_dec_tPLF_new.eps}\n   \t\\caption{The tilted likelyhood ${\\cal L}_t$ curve and the reconstruction error vs the number of decimated couplings  for an ordered, real-valued J on 2D XY model with $N=64$ spins.

The process is repeated for all the couplings obtaining then a fully connected adjacency matrix. The results here presented are obtained with $\\lambda = 0.01$.\n   For the minimization we have used the MATLAB routine \\emph{minFunc\\_2012}\\cite{min_func}. \n      \n      \\begin{figure}[t!]\n    \t\\centering\n    \t\\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{Jor11_2D_l2_JR_soJR_TPJR}\n    \t\\caption{Top panels: instances of single site coupling reconstruction for the case of $N=64$ XY spins on a 2D lattice with ordered $J$ (left column) and bimodal distributed $J$ (right column). \n    \t\n    \tBottom panels: sorted couplings.}\n    \t\\label{PL-Jor1}\n    \\end{figure}\n\n   \nTo produce the data by means of numerical Monte Carlo simulations a system with $N=64$  spin variables  is considered on a deterministic 2D lattice with periodic boundary conditions. \nEach spin has then connectivity $4$, i.e., we expect to infer an adjacency matrix with $N c = 256$ couplings different from zero. \nThe dynamics of the simulated model is based on the Metropolis algorithm and parallel tempering\\cite{earl05} is used to speed up the thermalization of the system.\nThe thermalization is tested looking at the average energy over logarithmic time windows and\nthe acquisition of independent configurations\nstarts only after the system is well thermalized.\n\n   For the values of the couplings we considered two cases: an ordered case, indicated in the figure as  $J$ ordered (e.g., left column of Fig. \\ref{PL-Jor1}) where the couplings can take values $J_{ij}=0,J$, with $J=1$, \n   and a quenched disordered case, indicated in the figures as  $J$ disordered (e.g., right column of Fig. \\ref{PL-Jor1})\n   where the couplings can take also  negative values, i.e., \n    $J_{ij}=0,J,-J$, with a certain probability.  The results here presented were obtained with bimodal distributed $J$s: \n   \n    $P(J_{ij}=J)=P(J_{ij}=-J)=1/2$.  The performances of the PLM have shown not to depend on $P(J)$. \n   \n    We recall that in Sec. \\ref{sec:plm} we used the temperature-rescaled notation, i.e., $J_{ij}$ stands for $J_{ij}/T$. \n   \n    To analyze the performances of the PLM, in Fig. \\ref{PL-Jor1} the inferred couplings, $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm inf}$, are shown on top of the original couplings,  $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm true}$.\n     The first figure (from top) in the left column shows  the $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm inf}$ (black) and the $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm tru}$ (green) for a given spin\n     at temperature $T/J=0.7$ and number of samples  $M=1024$. PLM appears to reconstruct the correct couplings, though zero couplings are always given a small inferred non-zero value. \n     In the left column of Fig.  \\ref{PL-Jor1},  both the $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm{inf}}$ and the $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm{tru}}$ are sorted in decreasing order and plotted on top of each other. \n     We can clearly see that $\\mathbb{J}^R_{\\rm inf}$ reproduces the expected step function. Even though the jump is smeared, the difference between inferred couplings corresponding to the set of non-zero couplings \n     and to the set of zero couplings can be clearly appreciated.\n     Similarly, the plots in the right column of Fig. \\ref{PL-Jor1} show the results obtained for the case with  bimodal disordered couplings, for the same working temperature and number of samples. \n     In particular, note that the algorithm infers half positive and half negative couplings, as expected.\n     \n     \n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{Jor11_2D_l2_errJ_varT_varM}\n\\caption{Reconstruction error $\\mbox{err}_J$, cf.

(\\ref{err}), as a function of temperature for three different sample sizes $M=64,128$ and $512$. \nThe error is seen to sharply rise al low temperature, incidentally, in the ordered case, for  $T<T_c \\sim 0.893$, which is the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature of the 2XY model\\cite{Olsson92}. \n However, we can see that if only $M=64$ samples are considered, $\\mbox{err}_J$ remains high independently on the working temperature. \n In the right plot of Fig. \\ref{PL-err-Jor1},  $\\mbox{err}_J$ is plotted as a function of $M$ for three different working temperatures $T/J=0.4,0.7$ and $1.3$. As we expect, \n $\\mbox{err}_J$  decreases as $M$ increases. This effect was observed also with mean-field inference techniques on the same model\\cite{Tyagi15}.\n\nTo better understand the performances of the algorithms, in Fig. \\ref{PL-varTP-Jor1} we show several True Positive (TP) curves obtained for various values of $M$ at three different temperatures $T$. As $M$ is large and/or temperature is not too small,  we are able to reconstruct correctly all the couplings present in the system (see bottom plots).\nThe True Positive curve displays how many times the inference method finds a true link of the original network  as a function of the index of the vector of sorted absolute value of reconstructed couplings $J_{ij}^{\\rm inf}$. \nThe index $n_{(ij)}$ represents the related spin couples $(ij)$. The TP curve is obtained as follows: \nfirst  the values $|J^{\\rm inf}_{ij}|$ are sorted in descending order and  the spin pairs $(ij)$ are ordered according to the sorting position of $|J^{\\rm inf}_{ij}|$. Then,\n     \ta cycle over the ordered set of pairs $(ij)$, indexed by $n_{(ij)}$, is performed, comparing with the original network coupling $J^{\\rm true}_{ij}$ and verifying whether it is zero or not. The true positive curve is computed as\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mbox{TP}[n_{(ij)}]= \\frac{\\mbox{TP}\\left[n_{(ij)}-1\\right] (n_{ij}-1)+ 1 -\\delta_{J^{\\rm true}_{ij},0}}{n_{(ij)}}\n\\end{equation}\nAs far as $J^{\\rm true}_{ij} \\neq 0$, TP$=1$. As soon as the true coupling of a given $(ij)$ couple in the sorted list is zero, the TP curve departs from one. \nIn our case, where the connectivity per spin of the original system is  $c=4$ and there are $N=64$ spins, we know that we will have  $256$ non-zero couplings.  \n     \tIf the inverse problem is successful, hence, we expect a steep decrease of the TP curve when  $n_{ij}=256$ is overcome.\n\nIn Fig. \\ref{PL-varTP-Jor1}\nit is  shown that,  almost independently of $T/J$, the TP score improves as $M$ increases. Results are plotted for three different temperatures, $T=0.4,1$ and $2.2$, with increasing number of samples $M = 64, 128,512$ and $1024$ (clockwise). \nWe can clearly appreciate the improvement in temperature if the size of the data-set is not very large: for small $M$, $T=0.4$ performs better. \nWhen $M$ is high enough (e.g., $M=1024$), instead, the TP curves do not appear to be strongly influenced by the temperature.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{Jor11_2D_l2_TPJR_varT_varM}\n\t\\caption{TP  curves  for 2D short-range ordered $XY$ model with $N=64$ spins at three different values of $T/J$ with increasing - clockwise from top - $M$.}\n\t\\label{PL-varTP-Jor1} \n\\end{figure} \n\n\\subsection{$XY$ model with complex-valued couplings}\nFor the complex $XY$ we have to contemporary  infer $2$ apart coupling matrices,  $J^R_{i j}$ and $J^I_{i j}$.

In comparison to the results shown in Sec. \\ref{sec:res_reg},\n  the PLM with decimation leads to rather cleaner results. In Figs. \\ref{MF_PL_err} and \\ref{MF_PL_TP} we compare the performances of the PLM with decimation in respect to ones of the PLM with $l_2$-regularization. These two techniques are also analysed in respect to a mean-field technique previously implemented on the same XY systems\\cite{Tyagi15}.\n  \n    For what concerns the network of connecting links, in Fig. \\ref{MF_PL_TP} we compare the TP curves obtained with the three techniques. The results refer to the case of ordered and real valued couplings, but similar behaviours were obtained for the other cases analysed. \n  The four graphs are related to different sample sizes, with $M$ increasing clockwise. When $M$ is high enough, all techniques reproduce the true network. \n  However, for lower values of $M$ the performances of the PLM with $l_2$ regularization and with decimation drastically overcome those ones of the previous mean field technique. \n  In particular, for $M=256$ the PLM techniques still reproduce the original network while the mean-field method fails to find more than half of the couplings. \n  When $M=128$, the network is clearly reconstructed only through the PLM with decimation while the PLM with $l_2$ regularization underestimates the couplings. \n  Furthermore, we notice that the PLM method with decimation is able to clearly infer the network of interaction even when $M=N$ signalling that it could be considered also in the under-sampling regime $M<N$.  \n \n \nIn Fig. \\ref{MF_PL_err} we compare the temperature behaviour of the reconstruction error.\nIn can be observed that for all temperatures and for all sample sizes  the reconstruction error, ${\\rm err_J}$, (plotted here in log-scale) obtained with the PLM+decimation is always smaller than \nthat one obtained with the other techniques. The temperature behaviour of ${\\rm err_J}$ agrees with the one already observed for Ising spins in \\cite{Nguyen12b} and for XY spins  in \\cite{Tyagi15} with a mean-field approach:  ${\\rm err_J}$ displays a minimum around $T\\simeq 1$ and then it increases for very lower $T$; however,\n the error obtained with the PLM with decimation is several times smaller  than the error estimated by the other methods.\n\n\n\n \n \n\n     \n     \\section{Conclusions}\n     \\label{sec:conc}\n\n\nDifferent statistical inference methods have been applied to the inverse problem of the XY model.\nAfter a short review of techniques based on pseudo-likelihood and their formal generalization to the model we have tested their performances against data generated by means of Monte Carlo numerical simulations of known instances\nwith diluted, sparse, interactions.\n\nThe main outcome is that the best performances are obtained by means of the  pseudo-likelihood method combined with decimation. Putting to zero (i.e., decimating) very weak bonds, this technique turns out to be very precise for  problems whose real underlying interaction network is sparse, i.e., the number of couplings per variable does not scale with number of variables.\nThe PLM + decimation method is compared to the PLM + regularization method, with $\\ell_2$ regularization and to a mean-field-based method. The behavior of the quality of the network reconstruction is analyzed by looking at the overall sorted couplings and at the single site couplings, comparing them with the real network, and at the true positive curves in all three approaches. In the PLM +decimation method, moreover, the identification of the number of decimated bonds at which the tilted pseudo-likelihood is maximum allows for a precise estimate of the total number of bonds. Concerning this technique, it is also shown that the network with the most likely number of bonds is also the one of least reconstruction error, where not only the prediction of the presence of a bond is estimated but also its value.\n\nThe behavior of the inference quality in temperature and in the size of data samples is also investigated, basically confirming the low $T$ behavior hinted by Nguyen and Berg \\cite{Nguyen12b} for the Ising model. In temperature, in particular, the reconstruction error curve displays a minimum at a low temperature, close to the critical point in those cases in which a critical behavior occurs, and a sharp increase as temperature goes to zero. The decimation method, once again, appears to enhance this minimum of the reconstruction error of almost an order of magnitude with respect to other methods.\n \nThe techniques displayed and the results obtained in this work can be of use in any of the many systems whose theoretical representation is given by Eq. \\eqref{eq:HXY} or Eq. \\eqref{eq:h_im}, some of which are recalled in Sec. \\ref{sec:model}.

The joint action of in-plane and out-of-plane ac electric fields generates Hall currents j â¼ Äâ¥ Ã E in both sum and difference frequencies, and when the two orthogonal fields have common frequency their phase difference controls the on/off, direction and magnitude of the rectified dc Hall current.\nThis novel intrinsic Hall response has a band geometric origin in the momentum space curl of interlayer Berry connection polarizability, arising from layer hybridization of electrons by the twisted interlayer coupling. The effect allows a unique rectification functionality and a transport probe of chiral symmetry in bilayer systems.\nWe show sizable effects in twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides and twisted bilayer graphene over broad range of twist angles. Nonlinear Hall-type response to an in-plane electric field in a two dimensional (2D) system with time reversal symmetry has attracted marked interests . Intensive studies have been devoted to uncovering new types of nonlinear Hall transport induced by quantum geometry and their applications such as terahertz rectification and magnetic information readout .\nRestricted by symmetry , the known mechanisms of nonlinear Hall response in quasi-2D nonmagnetic materials are all of extrinsic nature, sensitive to fine details of disorders , which have limited their utilization for practical applications. Moreover, having a single driving field only, the effect has not unleashed the full potential of nonlinearity for enabling controlled gate in logic operation, where separable inputs (i.e., in orthogonal directions) are desirable.\nThe latter, in the context of Hall effect, calls for control by both out-of-plane and in-plane electric fields. A strategy to introduce quantum geometric response to out-of-plane field in quasi-2D geometry is made possible in van der Waals (vdW) layered structures with twisted stacking . Taking homobilayer as an example, electrons have an active layer degree of freedom that is associated with an out-of-plane electric dipole , whereas interlayer quantum tunneling rotates this pseudospin about in-plane axes that are of topologically nontrivial textures in the twisted landscapes .\nSuch layer pseudospin structures can underlie novel quantum geometric properties when coupled with out-ofplane field. Recent studies have found layer circular photogalvanic effect and layer-contrasted time-reversaleven Hall effect , arising from band geometric quantities. In this work we unveil a new type of nonlinear Hall effect in time-reversal symmetric twisted bilayers, where an intrinsic Hall current emerges under the combined action of an in-plane electric field E and an out-of-plane ac field E â¥ (t): j â¼ Äâ¥ Ã E [see Fig. ].\nHaving the two driving fields (inputs) and the current response (output) all orthogonal to each other, the effect is dubbed as the crossed nonlinear dynamical Hall effect. This is also the first nonlinear Hall contribution of an intrinsic nature in nonmagnetic materials without external magnetic field, determined solely by the band structures, not relying on extrinsic factors such as disorders and relaxation times.\nThe effect arises from the interlayer hybridization of electronic states under the chiral crystal symmetry characteristic of twisted bilayers, and has a novel band geometric origin in the momentum space curl of interlayer Berry connection polarizability (BCP). Having two driving fields of the same frequency, a dc Hall current develops, whose on/off, direction and magnitude can all be controlled by the phase difference of the two fields, which does not affect the magnitude of the double-frequency component.\nSuch a characteristic tunability renders this effect a unique approach to rectification and transport probe of chiral bilayers. As examples, we show sizable effects in small angle twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (tTMDs) and twisted bilayer graphene (tBG), as well as tBG of large angles where Umklapp interlayer tunneling dominates.\nGeometric origin of the effect. A bilayer system couples to in-plane and out-of-plane driving electric fields in completely different ways. The in-plane field couples to the 2D crystal momentum, leading to Berry-phase effects in the 2D momentum space . In comparison, the outof-plane field is coupled to the interlayer dipole moment p in the form of âE â¥ p, where p = ed 0 Ïz with Ïz as the Pauli matrix in the layer index subspace and d 0 the interlayer distance.\nWhen the system has a more than twofold rotational axis in the z direction, as in tBG and tTMDs, any in-plane current driven by the out-of-plane field alone is forbidden. It also prohibits the off-diagonal components of the symmetric part of the conductivity tensor Ï ab = âj a /âE ||,b with respect to the in-plane input and output.\nSince the antisymmetric part of Ï ab is not allowed by the Onsager reciprocity in nonmagnetic systems, all the off-diagonal components of Ï ab is forbidden, irrespective of the order of out-of-plane field. On the other hand, as we will show, an in-plane Hall conductivity Ï xy = âÏ yx can still be driven by the product of an in-plane field and the time variation rate of an outof-plane ac field, which is a characteristic effect of chiral bilayers.\nTo account for the effect, we make use of the semiclassical theory . The velocity of an electron in a bilayer system is given by where k is the 2D crystal momentum. Here and hereafter we suppress the band index for simplicity, unless otherwise noted. The three contributions in this equation come from the band velocity, the anomalous velocities induced by the k -space Berry curvature â¦ k and by the hybrid Berry curvature â¦ kE â¥ in the (k, E â¥ ) space.\nFor the velocity at the order of interest, the k-space Berry curvature is corrected to the first order of the variation rate of out-of-plane field Äâ¥ as Here A = u k |iâ k |u k is the unperturbed k-space Berry connection, with |u k being the cell-periodic part of the Bloch wave, whereas is its gauge invariant correction , which can be identified physically as an in-plane positional shift of an electron induced by the time evolution of the out-of-plane field.\nFor a band with index n, we have whose numerator involves the interband matrix elements of the interlayer dipole and velocity operators, and Îµ n is the unperturbed band energy. Meanwhile, up to the first order of in-plane field, the hybrid Berry curvature reads Here A E || is the k-space Berry connection induced by E || field , which represents an intralayer positional shift and whose detailed expression is not needed for our purpose.\nand is its first order correction induced by the in-plane field. In addition, Îµ = Îµ + Î´Îµ, where Î´Îµ = eE â¢ G Äâ¥ is the field-induced electron energy . Given that A E || is the E â¥ -space counterpart of intralayer shift A E || , and that E â¥ is conjugate to the interlayer dipole moment, we can pictorially interpret A E || as the interlayer shift induced by in-plane field.\nIt indeed has the desired property of flipping sign under the horizontal mirror-plane reflection, hence is analogous to the so-called interlayer coordinate shift introduced in the study of layer circular photogalvanic effect , which is nothing but the E â¥ -space counterpart of the shift vector well known in the nonlinear optical phenomenon of shift current.\nTherefore, the E â¥ -space BCP eG/ can be understood as the interlayer BCP. This picture is further augmented by the connotation that the interlayer BCP is featured exclusively by interlayer-hybridized electronic states: According to Eq. ( ), if the state |u n is fully polarized in a specific layer around some momentum k, then G (k) is suppressed.\nWith the velocity of individual electrons, the charge current density contributed by the electron system can be obtained from where [dk] is shorthand for n d 2 k/(2Ï) 2 , and the distribution function is taken to be the Fermi function f 0 as we focus on the intrinsic response. The band geometric contributions to á¹ lead to a Hall current\nwhere is intrinsic to the band structure. This band geometric quantity measures the k-space curl of the interlayer BCP over the occupied states, and hence is also a characteristic of layer-hybridized electronic states. Via an integration by parts, it becomes clear that Ï int is a Fermi surface property.\nSince Ï int is a time-reversal even pseudoscalar, it is invariant under rotation, but flips sign under space inversion, mirror reflection and rotoreflection symmetries. As such, Ï int is allowed if and only if the system possesses a chiral crystal structure, which is the very case of twisted bilayers .\nMoreover, since twisted structures with opposite twist angles are mirror images of each other, whereas the mirror reflection flips the sign of Ï int , the direction of Hall current can be reversed by reversing twist direction. Hall rectification and frequency doubling. This effect can be utilized for the rectification and frequency doubling of an in-plane ac input E = E 0 cos Ït, provided that the out-of-plane field has the same frequency, namely E â¥ = E 0 â¥ cos (Ït + Ï).\nThe phase difference Ï between the two fields plays an important role in determining the Hall current, which takes the form of j = j 0 sin Ï + j 2Ï sin(2Ït + Ï). ( Here Ï is required to be below the threshold for direct interband transition in order to validate the semiclassical treatment, and Ï H has the dimension of conductance and quantifies the Hall response with respect to the in-plane input.\nIn experiment, the Hall output by the crossed nonlinear dynamic Hall effect can be distinguished readily from the conventional nonlinear Hall effect driven by in-plane field alone, as they are odd and even, respectively, in the inplane field. One notes that while the double-frequency component appears for any Ï, the rectified output is allowed only if the two crossed driving fields are not in-phase or antiphase.\nIts on/off, chirality (right or left), and magnitude are all controlled by the phase difference of the two fields. Such a unique tunability provides not only a prominent experimental hallmark of this effect, but also a controllable route to Hall rectification. In addition, reversing the direction of the out-of-plane field switches that of the Hall current, which also serves as a control knob.\nApplication to tTMDs. We now study the effect quantitatively in tTMDs, using tMoTe 2 as an example (see details of the continuum model in ). For illustrative purposes, we take Ï/2Ï = 0.1 THz and E 0 â¥ d 0 = 10 mV in what follows. Figures ) and (c) present the electronic band structures along with the layer composition Ï z n (k) at twist angles Î¸ = 1.2 â¢ and Î¸ = 2 â¢ .\nIn both cases, the energy spectra exhibit isolated narrow bands with strong layer hybridization. At Î¸ = 1.2 â¢ , the conductivity shows two peaks â¼ 0.1e 2 /h at low energies associated with the first two valence bands. The third band does not host any sizable conductivity signal. At higher hole-doping levels, a remarkable conductivity peak â¼ e 2 /h appears near the gap separating the fourth and fifth bands.\nAt Î¸ = 2 â¢ , the conductivity shows smaller values, but the overall trends are similar: A peak â¼ O(0.01)e 2 /h appears at low energies, while larger responses â¼ O(0.1)e 2 /h can be spotted as the Fermi level decreases. One can understand the behaviors of Ï H from the interlayer BCP in Eq. ( ). It favors band near-degeneracy regions in k -space made up of strongly layer hybridized electronic states.\nAs such, the conductivity is most pro- nounced when the Fermi level is located around such regions, which directly accounts for the peaks of response in Fig. that [â k Ã G] z is negligible at lower energies, and it is dominated by positive values as the doping increases, thus the conductivity rises initially.\nWhen the doping level is higher, regions with [â k Ã G] z < 0 start to contribute, thus the conductivity decreases after reaching a maximum. Application to tBG. The second example is tBG. We focus on commensurate twist angles in the large angle limit in the main text , which possess moirÃ©-lattice assisted strong interlayer tunneling via Umklapp processes .\nThis case is appealing because the Umklapp interlayer tunneling is a manifestation of discrete translational symmetry of moirÃ© superlattice, which is irrelevant at small twist angles and not captured by the continuum model but plays important roles in physical contexts such as higher order topological insulator and moirÃ© excitons .\nThe Umklapp tunneling is strongest for the commensurate twist angles of Î¸ = 21.8 â¢ and Î¸ = 38.2 â¢ , whose corresponding periodic moirÃ© superlattices have the smallest lattice constant ( â 7 of the monolayer counterpart). Such a small moirÃ© scale implies that the exact crystalline symmetry, which depends sensitively on fine details of rotation center, has critical influence on lowenergy response properties.\nTo capture the Umklapp tunneling, we employ the tight-binding model . Figures ) and (c) show two distinct commensurate structures of tBG at Î¸ = 21.8 â¢ belonging to chiral point groups D 3 and D 6 , respectively. The atomic configurations in Figs. ) are equivalent, which are constructed by twisting AA-stacked bilayer graphene around an overlapping atom site, and that in Fig. ) is obtained by rotating around a hexagonal center.\nBand structures of these two configurations are drastically different within a low-energy window of â¼ 10 meV around the Îº point . Remarkably, despite large Î¸, we still get Ï H â¼ O(0.001) e 2 /h (D 3 ) and â¼ O(0.1) e 2 /h (D 6 ), which are comparable to those at small angles (cf. Fig. in the Supplemental Material ).\nSuch sizable responses can be attributed to the strong interlayer coupling enabled by Umklapp processes . Apart from different intensities, the Hall conductivities in the two stacking configurations have distinct energy dependence: In Fig. , Ï H shows a single peak centered at zero energy; In Fig. (f), it exhibits two antisymmetric peaks around zero.\nThe peaks are centered around band degeneracies, and their profiles can be understood from the distribution of [â k Ã G] z . Figure (d) illustrates the atomic structure of tBG with a twist angle slightly deviating from Î¸ = 21.8 â¢ , forming a supermoirÃ© pattern. In short range, the local stacking geometries resemble the commensurate configurations at Î¸ = 21.8 â¢ , while the stacking registries at different locales differ by a translation.\nSimilar to the moirÃ© landscapes in the small-angle limit, there also exist high-symmetry locales: Regions A and B enclose the D 3 structure, and region C contains the D 6 configuration. Position-dependent Hall response is therefore expected in such a supermoirÃ©. As the intrinsic Hall signal from the D 6 configuration dominates [see Figs.\n3(e) vs (f)], the net response mimics that in Fig. . Discussion. We have uncovered the crossed nonlinear dynamical intrinsic Hall effect characteristic of layer hybridized electronic states in twisted bilayers, and elucidated its geometric origin in the k -space curl of interlayer BCP. It offers a new tool for rectification and frequency doubling in chiral vdW bilayers, and is sizable in tTMD and tBG.\nHere our focus is on the intrinsic effect, which can be evaluated quantitatively for each material and provides a benchmark for experiments. There may also be extrinsic contributions, similar to the side jump and skew scattering ones in anomalous Hall effect. They typically have distinct scaling behavior with the relaxation time Ï from the intrinsic effect, hence can be distinguished from the latter in experiments .\nMoreover, they are suppressed in the clean limit ÏÏ 1 [(ÏÏ ) 2 1, more precisely] . In high-quality tBG samples, Ï â¼ ps at room temperature . Much longer Ï can be obtained at lower temperatures. In fact, a recent theory explaining well the resistivity of tBG predicted Ï â¼ 10 â8 s at 10 K . As such, high-quality tBG under low temperatures and sub-terahertz input (Ï/2Ï = 0.1 THz) is located in the clean limit, rendering an ideal platform for isolating the intrinsic effect.\nThis work paves a new route to driving in-plane response by out-of-plane dynamical control of layered vdW structures . The study can be generalized to other observables such as spin current and spin polarization, and the in-plane driving can be statistical forces, like temperature gradient. Such orthogonal controls rely critically on the nonconservation of layer pseudospin degree of freedom endowed by interlayer coupling, and constitute an emerging research field at the crossing of 2D vdW materials, layertronics, twistronics and nonlinear electronics.\nThis work is supported by the Research Grant Council of Hong Kong (AoE/P-701/20, HKU SRFS2122-7S05), and the Croucher Foundation.

Degeneracies at higher energies can also be identified, for example, around Â±75 meV at the Î³ point. As the two Dirac cones from the two layers intersect around the same area, such degeneracies are usually accompanied by strong layer hybridization [see the color in the left panel of Fig. ].\nAdditionally, it is well-known that the two layers are strongly coupled when Î¸ is around the magic angle (â¼ 1.08 â¢ ), rendering narrow bandwidths for the central bands. As discussed in the main text, coexistence of strong interlayer hybridization and small energy separations is expected to contribute sharp conductivity peaks near band degeneracies, as shown in Fig. .\nIn this case, the conductivity peak near the Dirac point can reach â¼ 0.1e 2 /h, while the responses around Â±0.08 eV are smaller at â¼ 0.01e 2 /h. The above features are maintained when Î¸ is enlarged, as illustrated in Figs. ) and (c) using Î¸ = 2.65 â¢ and Î¸ = 6.01 â¢ . Since interlayer coupling becomes weaker and the bands are more separated at low energies when Î¸ increases, intensity of the conductivity drops significantly.\nWe stress that G is not defined at degenerate points, and interband transitions may occur when energy separation satisfies |Îµ n â Îµ m | â¼ Ï, the effects of which are not included in the current formulations. Consequently, the results around band degeneracies within energy â¼ Ï [shaded areas in Fig. ] should be excluded.\n\nNow, answer the following question based on the above text, only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nQuestion: What is the significance of the interlayer Berry connection polarizability?\nAnswer:", "input_tokens": 3522}

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nEgypt (TV series)\nEgypt is a BBC television docudrama serial portraying events in the history of Egyptology from the 18th through early 20th centuries. It originally aired on Sunday nights at 9 pm on BBC1 in 2005. The first two episodes explored the work of Howard Carter and his archaeological quest in Egypt in the early part of the twentieth century. The next two episodes focused on the eccentric explorer \"The Great Belzoni\" played here by Matthew Kelly. The final two episodes dramatise the discovery and deciphering of the Rosetta Stone by Jean-FranÃ§ois Champollion (Elliot Cowan).\nThe music was recorded by the Warsaw Radio Orchestra and is featured on the CD Timeless Histories by Chappell music, produced by Clare Isaacs.\n\nProduction\nThe series was a major new docudrama series produced by the BBC for the Autumn 2005 schedule.\n\"The whole idea behind the series was to be able to discover Ancient Egypt through the eyes of Howard Carter â famous for uncovering the tomb of Tutankhamun; The Great Belzoni â an amazing adventurer and explorer; and the scholar Jean-FranÃ§ois Champollion, who was the first to decipher the Rosetta Stone and open up the meaning of hieroglyphics.\"\nIn order to create a sense of \"seeing the treasures of Ancient Egypt for the first time\", Dolling and Bradshaw felt it essential to film at the actual archaeological sites referenced in the series.\n\n\"We had fantastic help from the Government and a local production crew, they managed to fix it for us to film in areas that, as far as we know, have never been used by other television or film productions.\"\n\"Being the first UK TV company to attempt such a project in the most amazing historical sights was very exhilarating, and to be able to return them - with additional sets and some computer imagery - to how they were during the time of the Pharaohs was incredible.\"\nFilming at such invaluable and popular sites created new challenges for the film makers.\n\n\"Keeping people out of shot was one â sometimes this was nearing impossible â but we tended to shoot early in the day so disruptions were kept to a minimum. The other was obviously making sure we didn't damage anything, which thankfully we managed!\"\n\"It was difficult keeping such a unique project running so far from home, and it is a tribute to the cast and crew that we managed to succeed. The series really is great and looks fantastic, well worth all the hard work.\"\nThe co-production between BBC and The Learning Channel was initially budgeted at around Â£6.5m but problems filming on location in Egypt, including the weather and illness, meant the producers required another Â£2million. Post production costs involved in recreating Ancient Egypt meant that the final costs could have resulted in a Â£5million overspend but the BBC denied this.\n\n\"To suggest the overspend is anything in the [range of] Â£5m is utterly ridiculous â it is simply not true. This was a huge project shot on location in Egypt and, as with any project of such scale, we had contingency funds available to us â so the unavoidable overspend was accommodated for and fully authorised.\"\n\"I think it's useful to point out that the cost per hour of Egypt will still be lower than other comparable programmes such as Pompeii, Genghis Khan and Pyramid. In fact, due to the international co-financing, this is actually incredibly good value for money providing full period drama for the budget normally associated with a documentary.\"\nSeveral multi-media productions were commissioned to tie-in with the series including interactive drama BBC Egypt Interactive, award-winning online-game Death in Sakkara: An Egyptian Adventure, and an interactive exhibition at BBC Birmingham.A companion series Egyptian Journeys with Dan Cruickshank, in which architectural historian Cruickshank travels the country to explore some of the intriguing stories that have emerged from ancient Egypt, was broadcast concurrently on BBC Two.\n\nReception\nReviews\nSam Wollaston writing about episode one in The Guardian said that he \"was expecting to hate this show,\" fearing it would be \"narration interspersed with lame reconstruction,\" but he was pleased to discover it was, in fact, \"a proper drama, with a very decent script and real actors.\" \"And it's a great story, too,\" he states, although he did not enjoy the re-enactments of the life of Tutankhamun, which he described as \"olive-skinned actors with non-speaking parts and an awful lot of eye-liner, wandering around in a semi-darkness lit by flickering candles,\" and claims were not necessary, \"but maybe that will help to sell it to America.\" He concludes that he is \"looking forward to part two.\"David Liddiment writing in The Guardian complimented the cleverly twinning of this docudrama with the more cerebral Egyptian Journeys with Dan Cruickshank on BBC Two but he points out that this was done during the final stages of the BBC's charter renewal review and insists that the corporation should keep up standards after this process is completed.\n\nRatings\nEpisode one (2005-10-30): 7 million viewers (29% audience share).\nEpisode two (2005-11-06): 6 million viewers (24% audience share).\nEpisode three (2005-11-13): 5.7 million viewers (23% audience share).\nEpisode four (2005-11-20): 4.8 million viewers.\nEpisode five (2005-11-27): 4.5 million viewers (18% audience share).\n\nEpisodes\nPart one: Howard Carter\nThe story of the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun by Howard Carter and the popular belief in the Curse of the Pharaohs, a supposed result of Carter's disturbing Tutankhamen's resting place. The episodes include short dramatizations of the life of Tutankhamun.\n\nEpisode one: The Search for Tutankhamun\nTutankhamun vanished from history in 1324 BC following his hurried burial and the erasure of his name from all monuments. In the winter of 1898 Carter is at the temples of Deir el Bahri recording wall reliefs threatened by a freak storm when he is thrown from his horse and makes a discovery in the sand. Retired Boston lawyer Theodore M. Davis funds Carter's excavation of Queen Hatshepsut's tomb but it is found to be empty and Carter deprived of further funding is reduced to selling his paintings to tourists on the street.\nIn 1905 Lord Carnarvon arrives in Luxor to convalesce after a road accident and is shown an artifact bearing the cartouche of the mysterious Tutankhamun discovered by Davis on his new dig. Tutankhamun succeeded his heretical father as pharaoh at the age of 8 and was named in honour of Amun to symbolise his mission to restore the old gods and save the empire from turmoil. An inspired Carnarvon employs Carter but they are denied access to the Valley of the Kings for which only Davis has a permit. Amidst the flurry of construction that marked the beginning of Tutankhamun's reign the most important to the boy Pharaoh would have been that of his tomb. An ailing Davis announces his discovery of this, the final Pharaoh's tomb, prior to his retirement. Carter doubts the find and convinces Carnarvon to take up the concession. The methodical and meticulous excavation commences in 1914 but is quickly interrupted by World War I.\nThe Carnarvons return to Egypt at the end of the war and Carter recommences his excavation but with a continued lack of results leading to doubts that any undiscovered tombs are left in the valley the funding is finally cut in 1922. Tutankhamun's tomb was well concealed to ensure his undisturbed afterlife. Carter convinces Carnarvon to fund one last season during which the tomb is finally unearthed. When the tomb is opened in the presence of Carnarvon and his daughter it is revealed to be the only unplundered pharaoh's tomb in the valley.\n\nEpisode two: The Curse of Tutankhamun\nIn 1922 Carter goes to the Egyptian Antiquities Service in Cairo to announce his discovery but disagrees with Director Pierre Lacau over the clearance and cataloguing of the contents. The discovery revealed a dark time in the history of Egypt and the death of its boy king. Carter assembles an international team of experts to commence the work under the unwelcome scrutiny of Lacau's inspector and the western press. Carnarvon's cavalier attitude to the finds he considers his property starts to infuriate both Carter and Lacau.\nAs the finds are slowly catalogued and removed Carter becomes close to Carnarvon's daughter Evelyn but his strictness begins to alienate his team. Tutankhamun was married to his own sister but the union failed to produce an heir to secure the future of the kingdom. Stories of the curse begin to circulate as Carter breaks through into the burial chamber to reveal an intact tomb. As Lacau threatens to take over the excavation and several of the experts quit, Carnarvon questions Carter over his leadership and his relationship with Evelyn. When he came of age Tutankhamun took over control of the kingdom from his military advisor Ay only to die from unknown causes shortly thereafter. Carter rushes to Carnarvon's death-bed where the two make-up. Upon Tutankhamun's death Ay seized the throne and married the widowed queen. Carter, disappointed by Evelyn's engagement to another man, returns to continue his work. Tutankhamun's death came before the royal tomb could be completed so he was hastily buried in the tomb Ay had prepared for himself. Lacau takes over the running of the tomb in 1924 when Carter and his team stop work to protest continued Egyptian interference.\nThe following year Carter is called back by Lacau to reopen the tomb with funding from Lady Carnarvon. The team start to extract the nested coffins revealing one of them to be made of pure gold that confirms the presence of a Pharaoh. The team begin to notice evidence that the burial was done in a hurry as the body itself is finally uncovered. When Ay died without heir a new dynasty took to the throne that erased all references to the Boy King. In 1932 with his work complete Carter leaves the tomb for the last time and hands the key to Lacau.\n\nCast\nStuart Graham as Howard Carter\nJulian Wadham as Lord Carnarvon\nCaroline Langrishe as Lady Carnarvon\nAlex Weaver as Evelyn Carnarvon\nValentine Pelka as Pierre Lacau\nWilliam Hope as Theodore M.

Finding themselves destitute in the streets of Cairo after work on an irrigation project falls through, they are rescued by the eccentric John Lewis Bukhardt who introduces them to British Consul Henry Salt. Belzoni is hired to recover the massive Head of Memnon, later revealed to a statue of the Pharaoh Ramesses the Great, as a gift for the British Museum. Arriving in Luxor in 1816 amidst a gold rush of black market antiquities dealers Belzoni finds himself unwelcome.\nAt the Ramesseum Belzoni examines the head and devises a plan for its removal. The local Caimakan, under advice from Belzoni's French rival Bernardino Drovetti, denies Belzoni's permit and initially refuses to supply labour until threats bring him around. Ramesses marriage to his true love Nefertari was fruitful and secured the family line and the country too was fertile thanks to the annual flooding of the Nile. The approaching flood season however threatens to strand the head in the heart of the flood plain bringing an abrupt halt to Belzoni's mission. When the local labourers finally arrive Belzoni immediately sets to work moving the head using the same techniques its builders had used 3,000 years previous. Belzoni sends the ailing Jim back to Cairo to request a bigger boat so that they can collect even more antiquities and with time running out is forced to take greater risks to get the head to the bank of the Nile.\nWith the head secured the Belzonis heads south along the Nile to Abu Simbal in uncharted Nubia to expand the collection of antiquities. Ramesses built two temples at Abu Simbal; one dedicated his beloved wife and the other to his military prowess in the first victorious campaign. Belzoni locates the entrance to the Great Temple but finds it blocked, and so forced to head back to Cairo he vows to return to excavate the site the following season.\n\nEpisode four: The Temple of the Sands\nBelzoni, arriving back in Cairo, is informed by Salt that only the head is to be sent to the British Museum while the rest of the antiquities he has collected are to be kept at the consulate. Salt refuses to fund an excavation at Abu Simbal and Belzoni is sent south again with Salt's secretary William Beechey and a local dealer called Yanni. Belzoni, whilst becalmed at Minya. spots Yenni talking to his French rival Drovetti and hastily rides to Luxor determined to get there first. Arriving to late Belzoni discovers that the entire area licensed to Drovetti and he must dig elsewhere.\nBelzoni, guided by the image of Ramesses, digs in an unlicensed area and discovers a perfectly preserved bust. An infuriated Drovetti has the local ruler issue an edict against Belzoni. With no other option Belzoni heads south to the Island of Philae to collect the antiquities he has stored there only to discover upon arrival that the French have ransacked them. Funds arrive from Salt to begin excavation at Abu Simbal and Belzoni heads to the site with two British Royal Navy officers. Work progresses slowly in the shifting desert until Belzoni devises a plan to build a palisade to hold back the sand. With the entrance uncovered the group cautiously enter to view the magnificent interior. Belzoni records every detail of the temple decorations, which celebrate the capture of Kadesh that made Ramesses a great warrior king. Back in Luxor Belzoni, reunited with Sarah and Jim, is threatened by Drevetti but undeterred he heads deep into the western hills where he enters the Valley of the Kings. Belzoni learns from Yanni and Beechey that Salt is selling off the antiquities he collects rather than donating them to the British Museum.\nPersuaded to go on with his explorations Belzoni constructs a battering ram to break through the thick walls of the valley side and open up an undiscovered tomb. Defying booby-traps Belzoni pushes on into the lavish interior of the tomb where he enters the burial chamber of the Pharaoh Seti I. It was here upon the death of his father that Ramesses started his reign, which would bring peace and prosperity to Egypt. The discovery of Belzoni's Tomb secures the Egyptologist's reputation and makes him a celebrity in his adopted home of London where the British Museum would later honour him.\n\nCast\nMatthew Kelly as Belzoni\nLynsey Baxter as Sarah Belzoni\nNevan Finnigan as James Curtin\nRobert Portal as Henry Salt\nRichard Dempsey as William Beechey\nThomas Lockyer as John Lewis Bukhardt\nJoseph Long as Bernardino Drovetti\n\nPart three: Champollion\nJean-FranÃ§ois Champollion uses the Rosetta Stone to unlock the mysteries of the lost civilisation of Ancient Egypt which had been closed off to Europeans for centuries prior to the invasion of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798. The stone, discovered by the French in 1799, had been created as a work of propaganda by the Greek-speaking Pharaoh Ptolemy V to establish his place in Egyptian cosmology and flashbacks are included to explain this belief system.\n\nEpisode five: The Mystery of the Rosetta Stone\nThe young Champollion, encouraged to develop his gift for languages by his elder brother, becomes obsessed with deciphering hieroglyphs as a means to telling the age of the world and revenging France against the British who had confiscated the stone in 1801. When Alexander the Great had conquered Egypt, he had fuelled local resentment by bringing in a Greek speaking elite to rule. Their descendant King Tutankhamun had commissioned a series of stones written in Greek, common Egyptian and hieroglyphs for temples across the land to extol his virtues and underline his claim to the throne.\nChampollion studies under Silvestre de Sacy in Paris but finds the professor who had himself failed decipher hieroglyphs dismissive of further attempts believing them to be symbolic rather than a true language. English scientist Thomas Young uses mathematics to decipher the inscription like a code whilst Champollion believing hieroglyphs to be representative of a spoken language attempts to relate them to the Coptic language of Egypt's ancient Christian communities. Young makes a number of breakthroughs including the spelling of Ptolemy in hieroglyphs while Champollion finds work as assistant professor at the University of Grenoble. France is thrown into political turmoil in 1815 following defeat at the Battle of Waterloo and the republican Champollion is arrested for sedition and exiled to Figeac until 1821. Eccentric Egyptologist Giovanni Belzoni discovers an obelisk inscribed with the name of Cleopatra in Greek and hieroglyphs at Philae and sends it back to Young in England.\nYoung makes a mistake in translating the obelisk setting back his work whilst Champollion using a copy of the obelisk creates a hieroglyphic alphabet that he uses along with Coptic to translate the name of Ramesses the Great from sketches of Abu Simbal. Champollion's discovery arouses the suspicions of the Catholic Church who fear hieroglyphs might disprove the historical accuracy of the Bible. Young wishes Champllion good luck in proving his theories but Sacy and the Church are determined to stop him.\n\nEpisode six: The Secrets of the Hieroglyphs\nChampollion is determined to travel to Egypt to prove his theory but poor and jobless he is reduced to buying up whatever scraps of papyrus he can find and this obsession alienates his wife. The Dendera zodiac purchased by the French King Charles X threatens to challenge the biblical chronologies of church scholars, as it is believed by some to date to before the Great Flood of 2349 BC. Champollion is called in to confirm Sacy's dating of the antiquity to around 2000 BC; he disputes Sacy's dating but not Church authorities by dating it to some 2,000 years later than that during the Roman period.\nChampollion is sent to Turin by the King to value a collection put up for sale by the French Consul to Egypt Bernardino Drovetti. Prior to his departure Champollion's wife announces that she is pregnant and she is not pleased by his new job. Champollion builds a strong reputation for himself in Italy even being invited for an audience with Pope Leo XII. Returning to Paris with a large collection of antiquities for the King he is put in charge of the Egyptian collection at the Louvre. The King finally agrees to fund Champollion's expedition to Egypt on the proviso that he does not publish any finds that contradict the teachings of the Church. Champollion, arriving in 1828, starts by studying the Great Pyramid at Giza discovering it to be a tomb built for the Pharaoh Khufu around 2560 BC. At Saqqara he finds the site largely stripped by dealers but in a forgotten tomb he discovers ancient hieroglyphs he translates to prove his theories. Eager to understand the Ancient Egyptians he pushes on to the ancient capital of Thebes where at the sprawling Temple of Karnak he reads the story of Ramesses the Great and the battle against the Hittites at Kadesh.\nAt Belzoni's Tomb in the Valley of the Kings the ailing Champollion reads the story of Pharaoh Seti I and learns of the burial rites of Pharaohs. He is thus able to comprehend the belief system of the Ancient Egyptians for the first time. Champollion dies back in France 18 months later but his legacy allows Egyptologist to comprehend the meaning behind monuments such as the Great Pyramid of Giza and to decipher papyri that lead to such discoveries as the Tomb of Tutankhamun by Howard Carter.\n\nCast\nElliot Cowan as Jean-FranÃ§ois Champollion\nStuart Bunce as Jacques-Joseph Champollion\n\nMedia information\nDVD release\nReleased on Region 2 DVD by BBC Video on 2006-02-06.Also released on Region 1 DVD (2 discs, but does not include the bonus 'Pyramid') by BBC Worldwide 2006-05-23\n\nCompanion book\nThe 2005 companion book to the series was written by author and archaeologist Joyce Tyldesley expands on the series to tell the full story of the discoveries and the colourful characters who made them.\n\nSelected editions\nTyldesley, Joyce (6 October 2005).

The 257th episode overall, it was written and directed by series co-creator and co-star Trey Parker. The episode premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on December 10, 2014. It is the second part of the two-part season finale which began with the previous episode, \"#REHASH\". The episode makes multiple references to earlier episodes over the season, as well as to previous seasons, while mainly lampooning the trend of culture constantly making trending topics with no actual relevance. It also lampoons news events such as the death of Eric Garner, the shooting of Michael Brown, the sexual assault allegations against Bill Cosby, the use of celebrity holograms, and generationism. YouTuber PewDiePie appears as himself, continuing his story line from the previous episode.\n\nPlot\nKyle Broflovski, feeling that the popularity of Let's Plays are leading to a countrywide \"crisis\", sends out a message on Twitter to help families come together. In response, Bill Cosby visits Kyle and invites him to star in a primetime television special. Kyle agrees, unaware that Cosby is a hologram. The special, a product of the conspiracy between Randy's former producer and Eric Cartman, is planned to feature various celebrities, holograms, and Cartman's commentary. The producer's staff, however, feel he has given too much power to Cartman, whose growing popularity results in his commentary window pervading throughout the world. Upon seeing an advertisement for the special, Kyle is furious that his idea has become a social media project, while Stan Marsh is upset at his father Randy's supposed involvement.\nRandy and Sharon Marsh file a police report on the hologram of Randy's secret identity Lorde, but the police are skeptical. A patrolman catches the rogue Michael Jackson hologram, but cannot physically apprehend him. Randy and Jackson learn of the special and agree to work together. When the Tupac Shakur hologram sent to capture Jackson appears at the police station, Randy and Jackson escape to the Marsh home. Randy learns that Stan and Kyle were taken hostage by the producer and is confronted by Tupac.\nWhen Kyle questions the producer, he explains that when he became a grandfather, one day he asked his grandson who his favorite celebrity was, the grandson's response being PewDiePie. Distressed, the producer reveals his true intentâto assimilate the younger generation's culture into his own. Stan calls out the producer for being \"such a grandpa\", to the latter's frustration. When Cartman's window appears before the producer, he attempts to have him shut down, but Cartman's power has grown to the point where he has reached \"trend-scendence\".\nAs Cartman continues appearing on screens throughout the world, he states that he is now \"trends-gender\" and therefore must be given his bathroom, his motivation for being involved. Tupac and Jackson unite against the producer and storm the restaurant where he has the hostages. As Jackson fatally shoots the producer, Kyle, realizing that world's population can see one another, speaks out to his brother, Ike, apologizing for being a \"grandpa\". He accepts that Ike will develop his generational interests, and admits his jealousy at Ike being a fan of CartmanBrah. Ike and his friends create a new trend, #webelieveinyou, which Kyle urges the audience to spread. In response, PewDiePie arrives and overpowers Cartman.\nIn the aftermath, Kyle's family has agreed to spend one hour together each night, though Stan is still confused over the previous events. Kyle suggests that they may never understand it, and further says that at least YouTube celebrities are authentic, having never been marketed to the public by corporations and entertainment industries. PewDiePie appears, grateful for the people of South Park.\n\nProduction\nThe episode contains numerous references to previous episodes in the series, mostly in connection to Randy Marsh's double life as Lorde. Customer service employee \"Steve\" returns from \"Grounded Vindaloop\", as does the Washington Redskins logo from \"Go Fund Yourself\", while Cartman's desire for his own bathroom is from \"The Cissy\".On the DVD audio commentary, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, in hindsight, thought the story would have been better off split up into three episodes and not two, mainly because there was a lot of content left that they wanted to use but not enough time. The original plan was to make the story three episodes long but they settled for two.The episode makes numerous references to the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, as well as the sexual assault allegations against Bill Cosby.\n\nReception\nThe episode received a B rating from The A.V. Club's Dan Caffrey, though he stated that \"It was rushed, it was messy, and it may have been just a bit too much story for South Park, even for a two-parter.\"Max Nicholson of IGN gave it a 6.8 out of 10, and stated \"the climax of the entire episode (and arguably the season)...didn't tie everything together in the way that it could (and should) have.\"Chris Longo from Den of Geek gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars, stating the episode \"was incoherent, hilarious madnessâits own artform.\" Longo's article also noted that, in real life, the topic #IHateCartmanBrah became the top trending topic worldwide on Twitter.\nPassage 3:\nList of Girls und Panzer episodes\nGirls und Panzer is a 2012 Japanese anime series produced by Actas.

Each episode is narrated by a \"body\" who watches the team as they pursue the tantalizingly difficult challenge of figuring out who this victim once was. Why would anyone volunteer for such a grim task? As new recruit Tyler Davies quickly discovers, each of the members of the team has his or her own reasons for volunteering for the Network. Alex Donovan is a former cop, whose then eight-year-old daughter was kidnapped two years ago and has never been found.

The show was broadcast on the channel M-Net from September 3, 2006 to November 19, 2006 over twelve episodes. The host for the season was Anthony Oseyemi The grand prize was $100,000 US Dollars and was won by  Tsholofelo âTebbyâ Gasennelwe.\n\nContestants\nSeason summary\nThe contestants for this season were initially split into two tribes: Embera, named after Panama's semi-nomadic and heavily body-painted tribe, whose buffs were blue, and Kuna, named after a traditionally matriarchal and politically organised people of Panama, whose buffs were red. During the pre-merge portion of the game, Embera won a majority of the reward and immunity challenges, while Kuna saw their numbers dwindle from six to three. When the tribes merged into the Nagual tribe (wearing yellow buffs), their original tribal alliances remained, and the former members of Embera quickly voted out Yaga and Nana, leaving Meti as the only former Kuna member left in the game. Following the elimination of Nana, Tebby approached Meti and Nike about forming an all-girl alliance. This new alliance, along with Jeremiah, voted out Leonard and the leader of the former Embera alliance, Derrick. When it came time for the final four, the contestants competed in two challenges in order to determine the final two. The first of these challenges was the \"plank\" challenge. As Meti was the first person to fall off the plank, she was eliminated from the game. As Tebby was the last person to fall off the plank, she automatically advanced to the final two. The other two contestants competed in a second challenge which Jeremiah won, advancing him to the final two while Nike was eliminated. Ultimately, it was Tebby from Botswana who won this season over Jeremiah with a jury vote of 5-1.\n\nVoting history\nPassage 7:\nGood Bye, Radar\n\"Good Bye, Radar\" is a two-part episode of the television series M*A*S*H that served as the fourth and fifth episodes of the show's eighth season and the 177th and 178th episodes of the series. Part 1 aired on October 8, 1979, with Part 2 airing one week later. The two episodes aired as a one-hour special during off-season reruns on May 12, 1980. As the title of the episode implies, these were the final two episodes to feature Gary Burghoff in his role as Corporal Radar O'Reilly.\nThese episodes were originally intended to be aired as season seven's finale, but CBS and the producers convinced Burghoff to return for the beginning of season eight. To make up for his imminent departure, Burghoff received a special credit in the opening of the first six episodes of the season, immediately following William Christopher's, which read \"also starring Gary Burghoff as Radar\". For the first three episodes of season eight, Burghoffâs absence was explained by Radarâs having been sent to Tokyo for some R&R. In two of the three episodes, Burghoff made cameo appearances.\nIn addition to Burghoffâs departure, these episodes marked the final appearance of Johnny Haymer in his role as Staff Sergeant Zelmo Zale. With the departure of Radar, Hawkeye Pierce, Margaret Houlihan, and Father Mulcahy were the only three characters left on the series who had any connection to the novel and film from which M*A*S*H was derived (with Henry Blake being killed off at the end of season three, Trapper John McIntyre discharged between seasons three and four, and Frank Burns being sent back to the States after indecent conduct on R&R following Major Houlihan's marriage, at the start of season six).\n\nSynopsis\nPart 1\nA typical night in the 4077th OR is underway, with the surgeons hard at work on patients. Something goes wrong, however, when the camp's primary generator goes out. Hawkeye gets his finger jammed in a rib spreader, severely spraining it.\nMeanwhile, Klinger, who is the acting company clerk, goes outside to find out what's wrong with the generator. Seeing his rival Sergeant Zale at the controls, Klinger instantly assumes Zale doesn't know what he's doing and goes to crank up the camp's backup generator- only to find that it's been stolen. The primary generator then blows out, leaving the M*A*S*H without power.\nWith the unit's power now completely gone, two concerns become immediate: a patient of B.J. Hunnicutt's, who has a stomach problem (which they fix by using an old style suction machine developed by Dr. Owen Wangensteen), and what to do with all the food in the camp (which Col. Potter fixes by having a smorgasbord for all the people in the area).\nMeanwhile, Radar is about set to return from his R&R in Tokyo, but has been bumped from his scheduled flight by a general's cardboard cutout. During his wait for his plane, he meets an attractive nurse, who is going home to Lancaster, Missouri. Hearing that, and noticing that she is not too far from the same area of the U.S. as he is, Radar and the nurse instantly hit it off. However, before they can get anywhere, Radar is placed on another flight, and despite his arguing with the officer in charge of booking, has to leave.  He tells the nurse that they should try to find each other when they get home.  After a goodbye kiss, Radar is off, back to the 4077th.\nAfter getting bumped from a jeep by some stranded GIs and having to ride back to the 4077th in an ox-drawn cart, Radar returns, tired and hungry, to a huge ovation from the people in the camp- especially Klinger, who has been waiting for Radar to return more than anyone. Immediately the camp wants Radar to find a generator, but Radar doesn't want to right away, wanting a shower and a meal. After some cajoling, Radar finally agrees to search for a generator, only to find the same luck that Klinger has had...no generators to be found.\nLater that night, while Radar is drowning his sorrows in the officers' club with his favorite Grape Nehi, Col. Potter enters the swamp with tragic newsâRadar's Uncle Ed, who had been helping his mother run their farm in Iowa for many years, has died. After breaking the news to Radar, who is trying to cope with it while also doing his job, Col. Potter tells Radar that he needs to go home to help his mother, and to get a DA-7 Hardship Discharge form for himself and fill it out. Hawkeye and B.J. congratulate Radar on going home, and Radar is happy too...he thinks.\n\nPart 2\nThe next day begins with Klinger desperately trying to get Radar to help him find a generator and get the office back in shape. Radar, however, does not want to hear it. He tells Klinger that no one helped him when he first became company clerk, and Klinger was going to have to learn on his own. Finally, Radar does help Klinger try and con a generator out of someone (with some help from Major Winchester, who convinces Radar to help Klinger). Although Radar is unsuccessful in getting a generator, incoming wounded inspires Radar to order a bunch of jeeps and trucks to come to the 4077th- resulting in outdoor surgery, by headlights!\nAfter that, and seeing Hawkeye operate with his injured finger (which still is bothering him), Radar decides to fight his discharge, claiming that he is more needed at the 4077th. After getting into an argument with Hawkeye, Radar still refuses to change his mind. At one point during said argument, Hawkeye calls Radar a jackass.\nIn one final attempt to secure a generator, Klinger gets a call from a supply sergeant at \"I\" Corps saying they have a generator available.  Klinger takes a case of Scotch whisky to I Corps to close the deal.  At that point, a major from a service-and-supply unit pulls up and demands the generator, saying that two other generators they tried to secure at I Corps were stolen.  It is at that point where Klinger learns what happened to the 4077th's auxiliary generator- the major took it for his unit! Klinger decides that payback is in order.  While the major and supply sergeant go fill out a requisition, Klinger himself goes to the supply central issue station, poses as the major's driver, and blackmails the dispatcher into giving him the generator without a requisition. Returning to the 4077th with it, Klinger is met with a heroes' welcome. Radar now realizes that the camp can survive without him if they need to, and he finally decides to go home.\nRadar says his good-byes to everyone in triage after a party for him goes awry due to wounded on the compound, and is saluted by Hawkeye while he watches the 4077th doctors in the OR from the hallway one final time. In another touching and moving scene, Radar tells all of his animals goodbye as well, telling them that instead of him everyone else at the 4077 will be caring for them.\nAfter the OR session, Hawkeye and B.J. return to the Swamp to find something on Hawkeye's bed...Radar's teddy bear, which he had kept with him throughout the war as a security item. It's taken as a sign that Radar has officially grown up and become a man.\n\nProduction notes\nThe first cast member to be hired for M*A*S*H, Gary Burghoff became the last to leave, following the departures of McLean Stevenson and Wayne Rogers in 1975 and Larry Linville in 1977. He would later reprise his role as Radar twice; one was in a 2-part episode of AfterMASH, and the other was in an unsold TV pilot W*A*L*T*E*R, which featured Radar as a rookie police officer in St. Louis.\nIn the episode \"War of Nerves,\" Sidney Freedman correctly predicted that Radar would leave his teddy bear behind in Korea when he went home.\nPassage 8:\nSuomen Robinson 2005\nSuomen Robinson 2005, was the second season of the Finnish version of Expedition Robinson, or  Survivor as it is referred to in some countries and premiered 18 September 2005 and concluded 12 December 2005. Immediately upon arriving to the island the contestants were forced to compete in two challenges in order to determine who would be eliminated. The two contestants, Elena Sinkevitch and Mari Jalonen, were both sent to a secret island. As a major twist this season, during the pre-merge portion of the game when a contestant was voted out they would move to a secret island where they would compete against two other contestants to remain in the game. The two contestants left on the secret island following the final duel, Elena Sinkevitch and Markku Markkanen, joined the other members of the merge tribe. The contestants were then divided up into two tribes known as \"Goal\" and \"Texas\". When it came time for the final four, the contestants took part in the infamous \"plank\" competition in which Jasna Preselj was eliminated and Markku Markkanen advanced to the final two. The other two contestants then took part in one more challenge in which Mira Jantunen won and advanced to the final two while Elena Sinkevitch was eliminated. The final two then took part in a duel which Mira Jantunen won and earned an extra jury vote for herself. Along with this, Mira also won the audience's jury vote. Ultimately, it was Mira Jantunen who won this season over Markku Markkanen by a unanimous jury vote of 11-0 to win â¬40,000.\n\nFinishing order\nPassage 9:\nRehash (South Park)\n\"#REHASH\" is the ninth episode in the eighteenth season of the American animated television series South Park. The 256th overall episode, it was written and directed by series co-creator and co-star Trey Parker. The episode premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on December 3, 2014. The episode is part one of the two-part season finale. The episode lampoons the popularity of Internet Let's Play celebrities and the phenomena of Internet trending topics that lack actual relevance. The episode also references and intertwines multiple elements from previous episodes in the eighteenth season of South Park. YouTuber PewDiePie plays himself in this episode.\n\nPlot\nKyle Broflovski has purchased video games to play with his brother Ike. However, Ike is more interested in PewDiePie's Let's Play videos, much to Kyle's disdain. The popularity of LP is noticed by Eric Cartman, who begins his own commentaries on his classmates. Ike has subscribed to Cartman's CartmanBrah channel, which annoys Kyle. Kyle later invites Ike's friends over to play video games, but they all watch Let's Plays in Ike's bedroom. The children dismiss Kyle, along with Stan Marsh, as out-of-touch \"grandpas\", and Kyle perceives his living room to be \"dying\".\nRandy Marsh learns of an upcoming benefit concert that will feature a roster of popular musicians, including his secret identity, Lorde. Randy is reluctant to perform due to his reliance on pitch correction software, but his producer reminds Randy that he needs the money due to his son Stan's spending on freemium gaming. Randy relents when his daughter, Shelley, expresses a desire to see Lorde perform, unaware of the truth. At the concert, Randy has second thoughts, but his producer insists that the audience does not care about the performance, telling Randy to \"just go out there and pump your hips and rub your clit.\" Randy notices Iggy Azalea performing with a hologram of Michael Jackson and feels like something is \"lost\". When Randy's performance begins, his off-key singing and poor live performance disillusion the audience. Randy accidentally sets the Michael Jackson hologram free and then rubs his groin in an attempt to win the audience back, but this only further enrages them and later causes Shelley to tear down her Lorde poster. Randy calls his producer, who says that fame has never been about music, but the publicity generated by performers' antics, Randy being a recent example.\nThe Jackson hologram boards a bus heading toward South Park, as he needs to \"take care of some important business\". The Syntech Hologram Company, in response, activates a Tupac Shakur hologram to pursue Jackson.\nRandy again contacts his producer, resolving to publicly reveal his identity as Lorde. The producer responds that artists are merely exploited to generate revenue, and that a hologram of Lorde will appear on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, exposing her anus to create more publicity. Seeing Randy as an obstacle to this plan, the producer's henchmen attempt to restrain Randy, who escapes. When Randy informs his wife Sharon of the plan, she is incredulous that she slept with a hologram, which is revealed to be Tupac. Meanwhile, Randy's producer conspires with Cartman to install him as the leader in an upcoming social media revolution involving holograms.\n\nProduction\nTrey Parker and Matt Stone said on the DVD audio commentary that this episode was originally two separate episodes, one about PewDiePie and one about Lorde. This plan did not materialize because they couldn't figure out an ending that would be long enough to fill up the time for either show. To rectify this, they intended to put them together to make one episode. However, this didn't work either because Parker had written a lot of good material and now felt it needed to be a three-part story arc episode. They considered actually doing this but expected problems with Comedy Central. After shifting back and forth between one episode and three episodes, they finally settled on two partway through the production cycle. In hindsight, they thought it would have been better off if they made it a three-part story.The scene in which Randy/Lorde is at the concert and gets into a fight with Iggy Azalea was originally going to be used as the final scene for \"The Cissy\", the third episode of this season. This idea was scrapped with the intention to use it later; it was used in this episode, but with a few modifications. Sia was originally present but was at some point removed and Randy was going to get in a fight with everyone else, not just one person.The PewDiePie story originated from Parker having similar experiences to Kyle that he had with his step-son. Another influence of the story was the fact that Parker and Stone felt that more people experienced South Park: The Stick of Truth, their video game, through PewDiePie than by actually buying and playing the game themselves. They thought it would be fun to \"rip\" on this.Parker and Stone said that making this episode, and the second part, made them feel old, mainly because the episodes deal with newer things that young people are interested in, such as new technology, pop music, and the focus on Internet. This is also where the title came from; things like Twitter, YouTube Let's Play, and the Internet in general, sometimes feel like places where all people do is \"rehash each other's shit\", an opinion that is shared by several characters in the episode.\n\nReception\nThe episode received a B+ rating from The A.V. Club's Eric Thurn, who commented \"at first this seemed like a pretty good, if also a bit scatter-brained episode of South Park\", but praised the continuity shown in both this episode and the entire season.Max Nicholson from IGN gave the episode a 7.8 out of 10, stating \"in terms of sheer meta-ness, this week's #Rehash was off the charts.\"Chris Longo from Den of Geek gave the episode 2.5 out of 5 stars and called it \"an episode that throws a lot of fun ideas at us with nothing to balance them out.\"\nPassage 10:\nSouth Park (season 2)\nThe second season of South Park, an American animated television series created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, began airing on April 1, 1998. The second season concluded after 18 episodes on January 20, 1999; it remains the longest season of South Park to date. Almost all the episodes were directed by series co-creator Trey Parker, with the exception of two episodes directed by Eric Stough.\n\nBroadcast\nThe first season of the show concluded with the episode \"Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut\", broadcast on Comedy Central in the United States on February 25, 1998, and had a cliffhanger ending regarding the identity of Cartman's father. The episode scheduled for April 1, 1998 promised to resolve the mystery, but was in fact an April Fools' Day joke on the creator's part: \"Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus\", an entire episode revolving around the two title characters. The April 1 episode was supposed to be a one-off, with the rest of the season starting in May. However, following overwhelmingly negative fan reaction, the episode resolving the Cartman's father storyline, \"Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut\", was moved from its planned May 20 air date to April 22. \"Ike's Wee Wee\" then started a six-episode weekly run of the season when it was broadcast on May 20.The show went on a summer break of a month and a half, and returned for another six-episode run on August 19, with the episode \"Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls\". The next installment came after a three-week break, with the Halloween episode \"Spookyfish\", which aired on October 28. The next two episodes were \"Merry Christmas, Charlie Manson!\" and \"Gnomes\", airing on December 9 and 16 respectively. The final episode of the season, \"Prehistoric Ice Man\" aired after five weeks of hiatus, on January 20, 1999. The third season then started a few months later, in April 1999.\n\nVoice cast\nMain cast\nTrey Parker as Stan Marsh, Eric Cartman, Randy Marsh, Mr. Garrison, Clyde Donovan, Mr. Hankey, Mr. Mackey, Tolkien Black, and Phillip\nMatt Stone as Kyle Broflovski, Kenny McCormick, Butters Stotch, Gerald Broflovski, Stuart McCormick, Pip Pirrup, Craig Tucker, Jimbo Kern, Terrance, Tweek Tweak and Jesus\nMary Kay Bergman as Liane Cartman, Sheila Broflovski, Shelly Marsh, Sharon Marsh, Mrs. McCormick and Wendy Testaburger\nIsaac Hayes as Chef\n\nGuest cast\nHenry Winkler as the Kid-Eating Monster (\"City on the Edge of Forever\")\nJay Leno as himself (\"City on the Edge of Forever\")\nBrent Musburger as Scuzzlebutt's leg (\"City on the Edge of Forever\")\nJonathan Katz as Dr. Katz (\"Summer Sucks\")\nDian Bachar as the Cow Days' announcer (\"Cow Days\")Multiple musicians and bands made guest appearances in the episode \"Chef Aid\".

It is one of the stations on the GuangzhouâShenzhenâHong Kong Express Rail Link between Guangzhou South railway station in Panyu District, Guangzhou and Futian railway station in Futian District, Shenzhen.\n\nGuangzhou Metro\nAn elevated metro station on Line 4 of the Guangzhou Metro started operation on 28 December 2017.\n\nServices\nChina Railway\nGuangzhouâShenzhenâHong Kong Express Rail Link\n\nGuangzhou Metro\nLine 4 (Guangzhou Metro)\nPassage 2:\nPingxiang, Guangxi\nPingxiang (å­ç¥¥å¸) is a county-level city under the administration of the prefecture-level city of Chongzuo, in the southwest of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.\n\nSituation\nThe city covers an area of 650 km2 (250 sq mi). It is bordered in the north by Longzhou County and in the east by Ningming County, both in Chongzuo, and in the south and west by Vietnam's Láº¡ng SÆ¡n Province.\nNational Route 322 comes through the city centre, as does the railway which continues on to Hanoi; a high-speed expressway, now also international, passes nearby.\nZhennan Pass, site of the Battle of Bang Bo during the Sino-French War, is now named the \"Friendship Pass\" and is considered the gateway to Vietnam.\nThere are also plans to build a high-speed railway from Nanning to the Vietnamese border.\n\nAdministration\nDemographics\nPingxiang has a population of approximately 106,400 (83.5% of the people belong to the Zhuang ethnic group, 2010). Ethnic groups include Zhuang, Han, Yao, Miao, Jing, and others.\n\nTowns (Chinese: é, zhen)\nPingxiang (Chinese: å­ç¥¥)\nShangshi (Chinese: ä¸ç³)\nXiashi (Chinese: å¤ç³)\nYouyi (Chinese: åè°)\n\nTransportation\nRail\nHunanâGuangxi Railway\n\nClimate\nSee also\nLang Son\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 3:\nG7211 NanningâYouyiguan Expressway\nThe NanningâYouyiguan Expressway (Chinese: åå®âåè°å³é«éå¬è·¯), commonly referred to as the Nanyou Expressway (Chinese: ååé«éå¬è·¯), is a 225.06-kilometre-long expressway (139.85 mi) in the Chinese autonomous region of Guangxi that connects the city of Nanning, the capital of Guangxi, and Friendship Pass, known in Chinese as Youyiguan, a border crossing between China and Vietnam. The Friendship Pass is located in the county-level city of Pingxiang, under the administration of the city of Chongzuo. At the border, the expressway connects with NorthâSouth expressway in Vietnam. The expressway is designated G7211, and opened on 28 December 2005.The expressway is a spur of G72 QuanzhouâNanning Expressway. The NanningâYouyiguan Expressway branches off from its primary expressway, G72, just before the western terminus of G72 in Nanning. The entire route is also part of Asian Highway 1.\nAlong with the G7511 QinzhouâDongxing Expressway and G8011 KaiyuanâHekou Expressway, it is one of the three expressways that connect China with Vietnam.\n\nRoute\nNanning City Center\nThe NanningâYouyiguan Expressway begins east of the city centre of Nanning, at the San'an Interchange in Qingxiu District. At this interchange, it connects to the G72 QuanzhouâNanning Expressway, its parent expressway, as well as the G7201 Nanning Ring Expressway, the G75 LanzhouâHaikou Expressway, and the G80 GuangzhouâKunming Expressway. It proceeds south, in a concurrency with the G7201 Nanning Ring Expressway and G75 LanzhouâHaikou Expressway, to the Liangqing South interchange in Liangqing District, passing through Yongning District on the way. At this three way interchange, the NanningâYouyiguan Expressway and Nanning Ring Expressway continue westward while the G75 LanzhouâHaikou Expressway branches off to the south.\nThe concurrency with the G7201 Nanning Ring Expressway continues until the Gaoling Interchange in Jiangnan District, south of the city centre of Nanning, where the NanningâYouyiguan Expressway proceeds southward, away from the city centre, while the G7201 Nanning Ring Expressway continues westward.\nThis section of expressway forms the southeastern part of a ring expressway around the city centre of Nanning. The orbital expressway is designated G7201 Nanning Ring Expressway. Hence, the G7201 Nanning Ring Expressway is concurrent with the NanningâYouyiguan Expressway for this entire length, and in addition, the two expressways share exit numbers during the concurrency.\n\nNanning Airport Expressway\nThe 18.443-kilometre-long section of the NanningâYouyiguan expressway (11.460 mi) south of the Gaoling interchange is known as the Nanning Airport Expressway. This section first opened in October 2000, and is so named because it connects the city centre with Nanning's international airport, Nanning Wuxu International Airport. As this section was built prior to the other sections, it uses different exit numbers than those employed on the rest of the expressway (in which kilometre zero is at the San'an interchange). Instead, the exit numbers reset, with the Gaoling interchange serving as kilometre zero for this section.This section of expressway is toll-free. Just south of the Gaoling interchange, all motorists must stop at a toll booth. Immediately after the toll booth, the Nahong exit provides access to and from the city centre of Nanning from the south.\nThe Nanning Airport Expressway section of the NanningâYouyiguan expressway traverses through Jiangnan District in a southwesterly manner, ending at the Wuxu exit, where it connects to Airport Road and Nanning Wuxu International Airport.\n\nWuxu to Youyiguan\nThe final section of expressway, from the Wuxu exit to the Vietnam border, is 180.063 kilometres (111.886 mi) in length. This section of expressway is tolled from the Wuxu exit to the Pingxiang exit. West of the Wuxu exit, motorists must stop at a toll booth.\nThe expressway enters the prefecture-level city of Chongzuo immediately after the Suxu exit. At the Yuanjing exit, the NanningâYouyiguan Expressway connects with the S60 QinzhouâChongzuo Expressway to the east. This exit opened along with the opening of the QinzhouâChongzhou expressway on 31 December 2012.The expressway passes just south of the city centre of Chongzuo, before continuing west to the county-level city of Pingxiang. The section of expressway between the Wuxu and Chongzuo exits has a speed limit of 100 km/h (62 mph). The speed limit between the Chongzuo and Ningming exits, just before Pingxiang, is 80 km/h (50 mph), and between Ningming and Youyiguan is 60 km/h (37 mph). The section between Ningming County and Youyiguan parallels much of China National Highway 322 and the HunanâGuangxi Railway.\nEntering Pingxiang, motorists must stop at a toll booth, marking the end of the tolled stretch of expressway. Immediately after the toll-booth is an at-grade intersection with China National Highway 322 and Jinxiang Avenue, the only at-grade intersection on the expressway. The expressway makes a sharp turn southward toward the Vietnam border and its southwestern terminus at Youyiguan. At Youyiguan, individuals must pass through the border checkpoint before entering Vietnam. On the Vietnamese side of Youyiguan is the northern terminus of NorthâSouth Expressway.\n\nExit List\nPassage 4:\nGuandong, Guangxi\nGuandong (Chinese: å®å) is a Chinese town located Northeastern Pubei, Qinzhou, Guangxi, which is famous for Guandong Fish.\nPassage 5:\nTonghe Station\nTonghe Station (Chinese: ååç«; pinyin: TÃ³nghÃ© ZhÃ n; Jyutping: tung4wo4 zaam6) is a metro station on Line 3 of the Guangzhou Metro. The underground station is located at the intersection of Guangzhou Avenue (å¹¿å·å¤§é) and Tongsha Road (åæ²è·¯) in the Baiyun District of Guangzhou. It started operation on 30 October 2010.\nPassage 6:\nKaiping\nKaiping (Chinese: å¼å¹³), alternately romanized in Cantonese as Hoiping, is a county-level city in Guangdong Province, China. It is located Ã­n the western section of the Pearl River Delta and administered as part of the prefecture-level city of Jiangmen. The surrounding area, especially Sze Yup (Chinese: åé), is the ancestral homeland of many overseas Chinese, particularly in the United States.  Kaiping has a population of 688,242 as of 2017 and an area of 1,659 square kilometres (641 sq mi). The locals speak a variant of the Sze Yup dialect.\n\nHistory\nDuring the Northern Song dynasty (960â1127), Kaiping was under the administration of Xin'an county (ä¿¡å®ç¸£)\nUnder the Qing (1649), Hoiping County made up part of the commandery of Shiuhing (Zhaoqing). It was promoted to county-level city status in 1993.\n\nAdministration\nAdministratively, Kaiping is administered as part of the prefecture-level city of Jiangmen.\n\nGeography\nKaiping's city centre is located on the Tanjiang River, 140 kilometres (87 mi) away from Guangzhou, on the edge of the county Kaiping west of the Pearl River Delta. Kaiping consists of broken terrain, mostly either rocky or swampy, with only a third of the land arable.  The county is shaped like a giant question mark (see map, in pink) and includes rural areas as well as three port cities: Changsha, Xinchang, and Dihai.\n\nNotable people\nWing-tsit Chan: Chinese American scholar\nEd Chau: member of the California State Assembly\nGeorge Chow: member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia\nYun Gee: Chinese American artist\nVÃ­ctor Joy Way: Chinese Peruvian politician\nBetty Kwan Chinn: Chinese American philanthropist\nLee Quo-wei (1918â2013): former Hong Kong banker\nLiang Xiang: former Governor of Hainan\nBetty Ong: American flight attendant aboard American Airlines Flight 11\nJean Quan: former mayor of Oakland, California\nBing Thom: Chinese Canadian architect and urban designer\nSzeto Wah (1931â2011):  Hong Kong politicianSzutu, Chiu: scholar, his publishing included inter generation of Chinese new zealanders,the biography of architecet Ron FongDelbert E.

They were built from the early Qing Dynasty to the early 20th century, reaching a peak in the 1920s and 1930s, with the financial aid of overseas Chinese, when there were more than three thousand of these structures. Today, 1,833 diaolou are still standing, with the most in the towns of Shuikou (æ°´å£é), Tangkou (å¡å£é), Baihe (ç¾åé), Chikan (èµ¤åé), and Xiangang (è¬åé), in that order (see map in article by Batto).In the late 19th and early 20th century, Kaiping was a region of major emigration abroad, and a melting pot of ideas and trends brought back by overseas Chinese, Huaqiao, made good.  As a consequence, many watchtowers incorporated architectural features from China and the West.  These were examples of the Qiaoxiang (åé) architecture.  The diaolou were built by villagers during a time of chaos and served two purposes: housing and protecting against forays by bandits.In 2007, the Kaiping diaolou and villages were added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and consist of four separate restored village areas: Zilicun village (èªåæ) in Tangkou, Sanmenli village (ä¸é¨é) in Chikan, Jinjiangli village (é¦æ±é) in Xiangang, and Majianglong village cluster (é©¬éé¾æè½ç¾¤) in Baihe township.The Kaiping diaolou was the location for parts of the filming of 2010 movie Let the Bullets Fly (è®©å­å¼¹é£).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nExamples of diaolous include:\n\nYinglonglou (è¿é¾æ¥¼), oldest extant diaolou in Kaiping, in the village of Sanmenli (Chikan township) built by the Guan (å³æ) lineage during the Jiajing era of the Ming dynasty (1522-1566), is a massive three-storey fortress with one-meter thick walls, in contrast with the high tower diaolou built much later with the aid of Huaqiao.\nJinjiangli Diaolou Cluster (é¦æ±ééæ¥¼ç¾¤), situated behind Jinjiangli Village (Xiangang Township), includes three exquisite diaolous: Ruishi Lou, Shengfeng Lou, and Jinjiang Lou. Ruishi Diaolou, constructed in 1921, has nine floors and is the tallest diaolou in Kaiping. It features a Byzantine style roof and a Roman dome.\nThe Majianglong diaolou cluster (é©¬éé¾éæ¥¼ç¾¤) is spread across five villages (Baihe township) in a bamboo forest: Yong'an and Nan'an Villages of the Huang (é») family; Hedong, Qinglin, and Longjiang Villages of the Guan (å³) family.\nZilicun Diaolou Cluster (èªåæéæ¥¼ç¾¤), located in Zilicun Village (Tangkou township), includes nine diaolous, the largest number among the four Kaiping villages designated by UNESCO. They feature the fusion of Chinese and various Western architectural styles and rise up surrealistically over the rice paddy fields.\nFangshi Denglou - Built in 1920 after contributions from villagers, this denglou is five storeys high. It is referred to as the \"Light Tower\" because it had an enormous searchlight as bright as the beam of a lighthouse.\nLi Garden, in Beiyi Xiang, was constructed in 1936 by Mr. Xie Weili, a Chinese emigrant to the United States.\nBianchouzhu Lou (The Leaning Tower), located in Nanxing Village was constructed in 1903. It has seven floors.\nNan Lou (åæ¥¼), or the \"Southern Diaolou\", located on the riverbank in Chikan township, which was known for seven local soldiers by the surname Situ (å¸å¾) who died defending Chikan from the Japanese.\n\nChikan\nChikan (èµ¤å) is officially designated as a National Historic and Cultural Town of China (ä¸­å½åå²æååé).  The old town of Chikan has many historical sites that are about one hundred years old.  For example, it has over 600 late-Qing and early-Republic historic Tong laus or Qilous (åæ¨/ é¨æ¨) continuous, spanning over a length of 3 kilometers, including the riverside stretch along Dixi Lu (å ¤è¥¿è·¯), sometimes referred to as 'European Styled Street'. Part of old Chikan town has been designated Chikan Studio City (èµ¤åå½±è§å) for filming of historical scenes.\nChikan township also has two restored diaolous:  Yinglonglou, built by the Guan (å³æ) lineage in the Ming dynasty, and Nanlou, memorialized by the martyrdom of seven Situ clan (å¸å¾æ) members in the early 20th century.\nHistorically, Chikan has been shaped by these two competing clans. One example is the existence of two libraries: the Situ's library, opened in 1926, and, not to be outdone, the Guan's library, opened in 1931; both libraries funded by overseas Chinese and incorporated architecture features from overseas.\nIt is a famous and well-known location for braised pork in noodles to locals.\nChikan is to become a tourist destination and the closing of local stores, dining posts, and streets are scheduled for the summer of 2017.\n\nMiscellaneous\nKaiping has been twinned with Mesa, Arizona, United States, since October 18, 1993.\nKaiping was a major source of emigrants at the turn of the 20th century. As a result, a large number of early Chinese Canadian and Chinese American communities had people who originated from Kaiping and its neighboring counties of Taishan, Enping and Xinhui, which is known collectively as Sze Yup. It is said that there are more Kaipingnese people living abroad today than there are Kaipingnese in Kaiping.

The shortform name of the line, Xianggui, is named after the Chinese short names of Hunan, Xiang and Guangxi, Gui.  The line runs  1,013 km (629 mi) from Hengyang in Hunan to Friendship Pass on Guangxi's border with Vietnam.  Major cities along route include Hengyang, Yongzhou, Guilin, Liuzhou, Nanning, Pingxiang, and Friendship Pass.\n\nHistory\nThe original single-track Xianggui Line was built in sections from 1937 to 1939 and 1950â1955.\nIn December 2008, construction began on a capacity-expansion project to a new pair of 723.7 km (450 mi) electrified tracks from Hengyang to Nanning, which would create a three-track line of 497.9 km (309 mi) between Hengyang and Liuzhou and a four-track line of 225.8 km (140 mi) between Liuzhou and Nanning.  The expansion project was completed in December 2013.  The new double-track from Hengyang to Liuzhou is called the HengyangâLiuzhou intercity railway and the new double-track from Liuzhou to Nanning is called the LiuzhouâNanning intercity railway.\nAs of May 2014, the southernmost section of the Xianggui Line, from Nanning to Pingxiang on the Vietnamese border, is undergoing capacity expansion to accommodate high-speed trains.\n\nPassenger service\nThe HunanâGuangxi railway is used by most trains traveling from Beijing, Shanghai, and other points in eastern China to Guangxi (Guilin, Nanning) and to the Vietnamese border. This includes the BeijingâNanningâHanoi through train.\nAt the end of 2013, high-speed passenger service was introduced on the HunanâGuangxi railway as well. A direct G-series trains from Beijing makes it to Guilin in about 10.5 hours. D-series trains continue from Guilin to Nanning, taking less than 3 hours for the trip.\n\nRail connections\nHengyang: BeijingâGuangzhou railway\nYongzhou: LuoyangâZhanjiang railway\nLiuzhou: JiaozuoâLiuzhou railway, GuizhouâGuangxi railway\nLitang Township: LitangâZhanjiang railway, LitangâQinzhou railway\nNanning: NanningâKunming railway; branch line to Qinzhou and Beihai\nPingxiang: HanoiâÄá»ng ÄÄng Railway\n\nSee also\nList of railways in China\nPassage 8:\nRuyifang Station\nRuyifang Station (Chinese: å¦æåç«; pinyin: RÃºyÃ¬fÄng ZhÃ n; Jyutping: jyu4ji3fong1 zaam6) is a station on Line 6 of the Guangzhou Metro. It is located underground in the Liwan District of Guangzhou. It started operation on 28 December 2013.\n\nConstruction incident\nIn the 03:00 hour of 5 October 2007, as the Ruyifang station was being dug up, water from an unidentified source covered a 300 m2 (3,200 sq ft) area of the construction site was submerged to a depth of 5 to 6 m (16 to 20 ft). No injuries were reported, and by 06:30 on 6 October, the previously submerged  portion was re-sealed.\n\nStation layout\nExits\nPassage 9:\nDiaolou\nDiaolou (simplified Chinese: ç¢æ¥¼; traditional Chinese: ç¢æ¨) are fortified multi-storey watchtowers in rural villages, generally made of reinforced concrete. These towers are located mainly in the Kaiping (å¼å¹³) county of Jiangmen prefecture in Guangdong province, China. In 2007, UNESCO designated the Kaiping Diaolou and Villages (Chinese: å¼å¹³ç¢æ¥¼ä¸æè½) a World Heritage Site, which covers four separate Kaiping village areas: Sanmenli (ä¸é¨é), Zilicun (èªåæ), Jinjiangli (é¦æ±é), and Majianglong village cluster (é©¬éé¾æè½ç¾¤). These areas demonstrate a unique fusion of 19th and 20th-century Chinese and Western architectural styles.\n\nHistory\nDiaolou structures were built from the time of the Ming Dynasty to the early 20th century, reaching a peak during the Warlord Era in the 1920s and 1930s, with the financial aid of overseas Chinese, when there were more than three thousand of these structures. Today, approximately 1,800 diaolou remain standing, and mostly abandoned, in the village countryside of Kaiping, and approximately 500 in neighboring Taishan.  They can also occasionally be found in several other areas of Guangdong, such as Shenzhen and Dongguan.The earliest standing diaolou in Kaiping is Yinglong Lou (è¿é¾æ¥¼) in the village of Sanmenli (Chikan township), built by the Guan lineage during the reign of Jiajing Emperor of the Ming dynasty (1522â1566). It was a massive three-storey rectangular fortress with one-meter thick walls, with little resemblance with the high tower diaolous built four centuries later.  Yinglong Lou was renovated in 1919 and is 11.4 meters high.In the late 19th century and early 20th century, because of poverty and social instabilities, Kaiping was a region of major emigration abroad, one of the \"pre-eminent sending area\" of overseas Chinese.  Diaolous built during the chaotic early 20th century were most numerous around the centers of emigration. Monies from emigrants wanting to ensure the security of their families, villages, or clan lineages were used to fund the diaolou.  Although the diaolous were built mainly as protection against forays by bandits, many of them also served as living quarters.  Some of them were built by a single family, some by several families together or by entire village communities.  Kaiping became also a melting pot of ideas and trends brought back by overseas Chinese. As a result, the villagers built their diaolou to incorporate architectural features from China and from the West.It wasn't until after 1949 when an administrative system that extended down to the small villages was created that the diaolou lost their defensive purpose and were then abandoned or converted.  Still, they stand as a tribute to overseas Chinese culture and the perseverance of the peasants of Kaiping.In 2007, UNESCO named the Kaiping Diaolou and Villages (å¼å¹³ç¢æ¥¼ä¸æè½) a World Heritage Site. UNESCO wrote, \"...the Diaolou ... display a complex and flamboyant fusion of Chinese and Western structural and decorative forms. They reflect the significant role of Ã©migrÃ© Kaiping people in the development of several countries in South Asia, Australasia, and North America, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and the close links between overseas Kaiping and their ancestral homes. The property inscribed here consists of four groups of Diaolou, totaling some 1,800 tower houses in their village settings.\"  The four restored groups of Kaiping diaolou are in: Zilicun village (èªåæ) of Tangkou township (å¡å£é), Sanmenli village (ä¸é¨é) of Chikan township (èµ¤åé), Majianglong cluster (é©¬éé¾) of Baihe township (ç¾åé), and Jinjiangli village (é¦æ±é) of Xiangang township (è¬åé).\nThe Kaiping diaolou was the location for parts of the filming of 2010 movie Let the Bullets Fly (è®©å­å¼¹é£).\n\nExamples\nYinglong Lou (è¿é¾æ¥¼), located in the village of Sanmenli (Chikan township), was built by the Guan (å³æ) lineage during the Jiajing era of the Ming dynasty (1522â1566). As the oldest preserved diaolou in Kaiping, it retains the primitive model of a watchtower with traditional square structure and is not influenced by western architectural styles.\nJinjiangli Diaolou Cluster (é¦æ±éç¢æ¥¼ç¾¤), situated behind Jinjiangli Village (Xiangang Township) of the Huang (é») family, includes three exquisite diaolous: Ruishi Lou, Shengfeng Lou, and Jinjiang Lou. Ruishi Diaolou, constructed in 1921, has nine floors and is the tallest diaolou in Kaiping. It features a Byzantine style roof and a Roman dome.\nMajianglong Diaolou cluster (é©¬éé¾ç¢æ¥¼ç¾¤) is spread across five villages (Baihe township) in a bamboo forest: Yong'an and Nan'an Villages of the Huang (é») family; Hedong, Qinglin, and Longjiang Villages of the Guan (å³) family. Tianlu Lou (Tower of Heavenly Success), located in Yong'an Village, was built in 1922 and is seven storey tall plus a roof top floor.\nZilicun Diaolou Cluster (èªåæç¢æ¥¼ç¾¤), located in Zilicun Village (Tangkou township), includes nine diaolous, the largest number among the four Kaiping villages designated by UNESCO. They feature the fusion of Chinese and various Western architectural styles and rise up surrealistically over the rice paddy fields.\nFangshi Denglou â Built in 1920 after contributions from villagers, this denglou is five stories high. It is referred to as the \"Light Tower\" because of an enormous searchlight with a brightness much like that of a lighthouse.\nLi Garden, in Beiyi Xiang, was constructed in 1936 by Mr. Xie Weili, a Chinese emigrant to the United States.\nBianchouzhu Lou (The Leaning Tower), located in Nanxing Village (åå´æ) in Xiangang township, was constructed in 1903.

The story involves a young woman who has returned from the dead and needs human blood in order to survive.\n\nPlot\nTwo men break into an old crypt, seeking to dump toxic waste and rob the graves. When an earthquake causes the toxic waste to spill, Catherine Valmont, a young woman who died several years ago, is resurrected. She viciously kills the thieves and drinks their blood. As Catherine walks aimlessly through a field, Barbara spots her and takes a few photos, though Barbara's boyfriend, Greg, takes no notice. Catherine returns to her old house, the Valmont Mansion, and memories of her childhood come back to her, especially her childhood friend, HÃ©lÃ¨ne. As Catherine wanders the house, a real estate agent shows an old couple around the property, though they show little interest. After they leave, HÃ©lÃ¨ne calls the house, presumably inquiring about it. However, she hears nothing but a cherished music box, leading her to believe that Catherine may still be alive.\nThe agent later returns to the Valmont Mansion, along with her boyfriend. Catherine interrupts them having sex, killing both and drinking their blood. HÃ©lÃ¨ne arrives and is shocked to discover the dead bodies. When she finds Catherine, naked and playing the piano, she assumes that Catherine didn't really die but was actually hidden for the past two years. HÃ©lÃ¨ne washes the blood off Catherine, puts her to bed, and drags the bodies down to the crypt, where she discovers the bodies of the grave robbers. Catherine creeps down and begins to drink the blood from one of the bodies, but HÃ©lÃ¨ne stops her. HÃ©lÃ¨ne cuts her arm and lets Catherine drink her blood, until she can think of a way to supply her friend with blood.\nBarbara goes around the village asking about the woman in her photograph, but the answer is always the same: It is Catherine Valmont, and she died two years ago. Greg thinks Barbara is making too much of it, and discourages her from investigating further. Meanwhile, HÃ©lÃ¨ne tries to understand what is happening to Catherine, trying to teach her to speak again. Deciding to bring her victims, HÃ©lÃ¨ne pretends to be out of fuel and flags down a helpful motorist, drawing her back to the mansion. HÃ©lÃ¨ne offers the woman a drink and locks her in. The woman soon begins to panic, but HÃ©lÃ¨ne throws her in the crypt, where Catherine grabs her and rips her stomach out. Soon after, Barbara shows up at the Valmont mansion, seeking Catherine. Unsettled by Catherine's behavior, she attempts to phone Greg, but HÃ©lÃ¨ne confronts her. They argue, and HÃ©lÃ¨ne tries to take Barbara's camera. Barbara flees.\nCatherine, now more in touch with her humanity, realizes that she must be destroyed. She begs HÃ©lÃ¨ne to kill her, but HÃ©lÃ¨ne instead goes back to the village, to bring Catherine another victim. Barbara sees HÃ©lÃ¨ne and eventually convinces Greg to accompany her to the mansion, in order to help Catherine. HÃ©lÃ¨ne tortures the kidnapped girl, but Catherine rejects the unwilling sacrifice and frees her, telling her to return to the village and seek help. Drawn by the screams, Barbara and Greg go to investigate, but they are brutally murdered by HÃ©lÃ¨ne. Overwhelmed by all the death and murder, Catherine attempts suicide, but she is rescued by HÃ©lÃ¨ne, who offers herself to sate Catherine's hunger. Unable to resist, Catherine devours her friend alive.\n\nCast\nMarina Pierro as HÃ©lÃ¨ne\nFranÃ§oise Blanchard as Catherine Valmont (\"The Living Dead Girl\")\nMike Marshall as Greg\nCarina Barone as Barbara Simon\nFanny Magiere as 6th Victim (as Fanny Magieri)\nPatricia Besnard-Rousseau\nVÃ©ronique Pinson (as Veronique Pinson)\nSandrine Morel as Teenage Catherine Valmont\nSam Selsky as Old American man in the house of Catherine\n\nProduction\nRollin originally sought Italian actress Teresa Ann Savoy for the title role, but when she met him, Savoy said she would never work with Rollin under any circumstances. Instead, Blanchard was cast. She found the shooting to be physically exhausting and collapsed on the set. Blanchard's performance in the ending scene in which Catherine devours HÃ©lÃ¨ne and descends into madness was so believable that the crew were worried for her mental state, thinking that she had in fact gone mad.\nRollin met Pierro at the Sitges Film Festival, casting her for her strong personality, but finding her vain.\n\nRelease\nThe original release was 25 August 1982. Alternate titles included The Living Dead Girl, Lady Dracula, Queen Zombie and Scare: Dead or Alive.\n\nCensorship\nLa morte vivante was banned in Germany in 1986 for its explicit scenes of violence and gore. The film was released direct-to-video in the United Kingdom in 1994; however, most of these scenes were removed or shortened by the BBFC in order for the film to pass with an 18 certificate. A scene in which Catherine impales a woman's throat which her sharp fingernail was edited; one in which a female victim is disemboweled by Catherine was slightly cut to remove some of the prolonged gore; a scene in which HÃ©lÃ¨ne slashes at a teenage girl's navel area was completely removed; the ending scene where Catherine eats HÃ©lÃ¨ne alive was somewhat trimmed down; and the shot where HÃ©lÃ¨ne's thumb is bitten off was cut. Some of these scenes were waived for the 2000 release, which also premiered on UK television for the first time in 2005 when it was screened on The Horror Channel. The film was eventually passed uncut in the UK in 2007.\n\nReception\nBloody Disgusting rated the Blu-ray release 3 out of 5, saying that the film has plenty of flaws but is worth watching.\n\nHome media\nIn the United States, La morte vivante was initially released on DVD in an edited version on 9 November 1999, and was available in a \"Widescreen Edition\" via Image Entertainment and Redemption. It was re-released on DVD, complete and uncut for the first time, on 25 October 2010 by Redemption. Kino Lorber and Redemption released a Blu-ray version, as well as a remastered DVD on 7 August 2012, featuring an intro by Rollin, several featurettes and interviews, and a 12-page booklet.In the United Kingdom, the film was first made available on VHS format in a direct-to-video release in 1994. It was issued on DVD on 2 May 2000, followed by a reissued VHS version on 8 May 2000. The DVD contained a cropped 4:3 aspect ratio, which was a transfer from the original video release and reversible cover artwork. Redemption released two subsequent DVD editions in the UK, the first on 3 September 2007, presenting the film complete and uncensored for the first time. The second was released on 18 May 2015, containing newly commissioned artwork.La morte vivante, under the title The Living Dead Girl, received a Blu-ray release in the UK in 2018. Released by Black House Films, this version of the film has a 1:78:1 aspect ratio.\nThe complete uncut version was released by Encore in Europe on 30 November 2005 in a 2-DVD set with a new aspect ratio of 16:9/1.78:1. The special features included introductions by Blanchard (in French with English subtitles) and Rollin, selected scenes commentary by Blanchard (in French with English subtitles), a bonus soundtrack CD, a 64-page essay booklet, and interviews (all in French with English subtitles) with Blanchard, Jean-Pierre Bouyxou and composer Philippe d'Aram.\nPassage 3:\nLa Morte\nLa Morte (French pronunciation: â[la mÉÊt]) is a commune in the IsÃ¨re department in southeastern France.\n\nPopulation\nSee also\nCommunes of the IsÃ¨re department\nPassage 4:\nJacques Tourneur\nJacques Tourneur (French: [tuÊnÅÊ]; November 12, 1904 â December 19, 1977) was a French film director known for the classic film noir Out of the Past and a series of low-budget horror films he made for RKO Radio Pictures by Val Lewton, including Cat People, I Walked with a Zombie, and The Leopard Man. He is also known for directing Night of the Demon, which was released by Columbia Pictures. While in Hollywood, he was usually addressed by his anglicized name \"Jack Turner\", a literal and phonetic translation of his name in English.\n\nLife\nBorn in Paris, France, Tourneur was the son of Fernande Petit and film director Maurice Tourneur. At age 10, Jacques moved to the United States with his father. He started a career in cinema while still attending high school as an extra and later as a script clerk in various silent films. Both Maurice and Jacques returned to France after his father worked on the film The Mysterious Island in 1925. Tourneur died in 1977, aged 73, in Bergerac, Dordogne, France.\n\nCareer\nTourneur began work as an editor and assistant director. He made his debut as a director on the French film Tout Ã§a ne vaut pas l'amour in 1931. Tourneur went to Hollywood in 1934 where he had a contract with MGM Studios. While working as the second unit director on the film A Tale of Two Cities he met film producer Val Lewton.Tourneur made his feature debut as director in the 1939 film They All Come Out. After Tourneur was dropped by MGM in 1941, he was picked up by Lewton to film several acclaimed low-budget horror films for RKO Studios including Cat People and I Walked with a Zombie.Cat People, although considered a B movie and made on a limited budget, was distinguished by a style of lighting and cinematography that has been imitated countless times. Tourneur was promoted to the A-list at RKO, directing films including Out of the Past and Berlin Express. In the 1950s, Tourneur became a freelance director, filming various genre films including Wichita, Anne of the Indies, Way of a Gaucho, Nightfall, The Flame and the Arrow, Stars In My Crown and Night of the Demon. His last two films, made for American International Pictures and starring Vincent Price, were The Comedy of Terrors (1963) and War-Gods of the Deep (1965).After his final days working for film, Tourneur began directing television episodes. Tourneur filmed episodes of The Barbara Stanwyck Show, Bonanza, The Twilight Zone, and The Alaskans. Tourneur's final director credit was for an episode of T.H.E. Cat in 1966. Tourneur then retired and returned to France.\n\nFilmography\nDirector\nFeature films\n\nShort films\n\nTV\n1955-1961 : General Electric Theater, 4 episodes\n1955 : The Martyr\n1955 : Into the Night\n1960 : Aftermath\n1961 : Star Witness: The Lili Parrish Story\n1956 : Fireside Theater, 3 episodes\n1956 : A Hero Returns\n1956 : Kirsti\n1956 : The Mirror\n1957 : Schlitz Playhouse of Stars, 1 episode\n1957 : Outlaw's Boots\n1957 : The Walter Winchell File, 3 episodes\n1957 : The Steep Hill\n1958 : House on Biscayne Bay\n1958 : The Stopover\n1958 : Cool and Lam, CBS Productions\n1958 : Northwest Passage, 8 episodes\n1958 : The Gunsmith\n1958 : The Burning Village\n1958 : The Bond Women\n1959 : The Break Out\n1959 : The Vulture\n1959 : The Traitor\n1959 : The Assassin\n1959 : The Hostage\n1959 : Bonanza, 1 episode\n1960 : Denver McKee\n1959 : The Alaskans, 1 episode\n1960 : The Devil Makers\n1960 : The Barbara Stanwyck Show, 11 episodes\n1960 : The Mink Coat\n1960 : Ironbark's Bridge\n1960 : The Miraculous Journey of Tadpole Chan\n1961 : Frightened Doll\n1961 : The Choice\n1961 : Sign of the Zodiac\n1961 : Adventure on Happiness Street\n1961 : The Golden Acres\n1961 : Confession\n1961 : Dragon by the Tail\n1961 : Dear Charlie\n1962 : Adventures in Paradise, 1 episode\n1962 : A Bride for the Captain\n1962 : Follow the Sun, 1 episode\nSergeant Kolchak Fades Away\n1963 : The Twilight Zone, 1 episode\n1963 : Night Call\n1966 : T.H.E.

Rollin's subsequent notable works include La rose de fer (1973), LÃ¨vres de sang (1975), Les raisins de la mort (1978), Fascination (1979), and La morte vivante (1982).His films are noted for their exquisite, if mostly static, cinematography, off-kilter plot progression, poetic dialogue, playful surrealism and recurrent use of well-constructed female lead characters. Outlandish dÃ©nouements and abstruse visual symbols were trademarks. Belied by high production values and precise craftsmanship, his films were made with little money, often against deadlines. In the mid-1970s, lack of regular work led the director to direct mostly pornographic films under various pseudonyms, an activity he continued until the early 1980s.\n\nEarly life\nJean Rollin was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine (now Hauts-de-Seine), France, to Claude Louis RenÃ© Rollin-Roth-Le Gentil, an actor and theatre director who went by the stage name Claude Martin, and his wife Denise (nÃ©e Leffroi), an artists' model. His half-brother was actor Olivier Rollin.\n\nCareer\nRollin had a passion for cinema from an early age.  He saw his first film during the second World War. It was Capitaine Fracasse, a 1942 film directed by Abel Gance.  Rollin decided he wanted to make films when he grew up; his father, a theatre actor, was a heavy influence on him.  During his teens, he developed an obsession for American serials and read comic books.  \nWhen he was 16, he found a job at Les Films de Saturne, helping write invoices while earning some money though he wanted to be involved in cinema.  They specialized in creating opening and closing credits and short cartoons, but real films were also shot such as industrial shorts and documentaries.  Rollin was part of the crew in a short documentary about Snecma, a big factory in France which built motors and planes.  He arranged the tracking shots, laid the tracks, checked the electricity, and helped the cameraman.\nWhen Rollin did his military service for the French army, he worked as an editor in the cinema department alongside Claude Lelouch.  They worked on army commercials with Lelouch directing and Rollin editing. They also made two films, Mechanographie, a documentary, and La Guerre de Silence (The War of Silence), a real film with actors and a story.\nIn 1958 after leaving the army, he directed his first short film Les Amours Jaunes (The Yellow Lovers).  He shot it on a 35mm Maurigraphe camera, and used a beach in Dieppe as his location, the same beach used in his later films.\n\n1960s\nIn 1960, Rollin decided to direct his first feature film, but later abandoned the project as he had no money to finish it.  His next short, Ciel de Cuivre (Sky of Copper), was directed in 1961, and was quite surreal though it told a sentimental story.  He did not finish the film because he ran out of money and it was not very good.  The footage is now lost.\nIn 1962, he was as an assistant director on the film Un Cheval pour Deux (A Horse for Two), which was not a great experience for him, and he decided to approach cinema in a different way.  In the early sixties, Rollin became interested in politics and made a short documentary in 1964 called Vivre en Espagne (Life in Spain). It was about Generalissimo Francisco Franco, thirty minutes were filmed but he risked a lot to get it made.  Rollin and the crew found themselves pursued by the police and just managed to make it back into France.  Jean also directed a short film in 1965 called Les Pays Loins.\n\nIn 1968, Jean directed his first feature Le Viol du Vampire (The Rape of the Vampire).  At the time he was still not known in the world of cinema, having only done a few short films and documentaries.  The film was shot on a low budget, and consisted of two parts because it was originally intended to be another short film; the second part was later added so that it was released as a feature film.  The release of Le Viol caused public scandal and outrage, his strong inspiration of American serials did not attract viewers.  It was released during the events of May 1968, and due to the riots, it was a rare theatrical production at the time. Rollin himself was also threatened due to this scandal, because of this, he briefly decided to give up making films.\nHis second feature La Vampire Nue (The Nude Vampire) was his first film in colour.  It was mostly inspired by the 1916 film Judex, and also surrealism in general. Rollin wanted to do something a little more temperate than Le Viol, a traditional mystery film. Anyway, as he himself stated, it came to be the same kind of film as his first feature, it also has the same spirit. La vampire nue also became notable in that it introduced Catherine and Marie-Pierre Castel, twin sisters who frequently collaborated with Rollin during the early years of his career.\nFollowing La vampire nue, Rollin found himself in a financial crisis and having suffered an accident during production which left him traumatized, the circumstances took a positive turn when he met with producer Monique Nathan, owner of the Films Moderns company. Nathan having put her faith and support in Rollin, turned down several a number of the most prominent French New Wave filmmakers for financing and instead entirely supported Rollin as both a producer and a co-screenwriter for his next project, Le Frisson des Vampires (Shiver of the Vampires) which was heavily influenced by the trappings of the hippie movement. It did however retain many of the themes one could expect from a Rollin film and one of the most iconic scenes ever to appear in a Rollin film: actress Dominique emerging from an old grandfather clock. Production for the film took place in an abandoned castle in Soissons, a commune in the Aisne department of Picardy.\n\n1970s\n1971, Rollin directed Requiem pour un Vampire (Requiem for a Vampire), which became one of his most successful films, and it was another low budget production, which almost took no money to produce.  There was no dialogue in the first forty minutes of the film, this was in Rollin's words to make the \"ultimate naive film\", simplifying the story, direction and cinematography. Initially, Rollin had Catherine Castel in mind to play one of the leading ladies in Requiem; however, Castel was unable to accept the role due to being pregnant, which forced Rolling to offer the role to Maire-Pierre. The second female lead was portrayed by Mireille D'argent whom Rollin chose after she was introduced to him by an agent. Rollin discovered that D'argent's agent was collecting her wages, which prompted him to contact a lawyer and have her wages returned to her. Requiem was filmed in the small village of CrÃªvecoeur. The graveyard was located outside the village on a knoll. The castle, a historical place entirely furnished with genuine antiques, all of which were worth a fortune, had been rented from the duchess of Roche-Guyon. It wasn't her castle that Rollin and the crew were interested in, but the ruins of the dungeon above, that overlooked the entire area. Following this, Rollin made a temporary departure to creating films associated with the erotic vampire genre.\nHaving risen to success during his early vampire era, Rollin embarked on a different approach to filmmaking. Rollin financed his 1973 film La Rose de Fer (The Iron Rose) himself and was convinced that it would become a failure, leading to financial ruin. Prior to production, he engaged in a deal with Impex films to direct a number of hardcore porn films in the near future in order to produce La rose de fer and ensure that it would not fail. The story follows two young lovers (FranÃ§oise Pascal and Hugues Quester) who meet at a wedding reception and agree to go on a date, for which they decide to take a walk in an enormous cemetery. As they make love in an underground tomb, strange and bizarre occurrences take place above ground. As night falls, they frantically try to escape from the cemetery, and with no luck, end up where they started. They are slowly overcome with hysteria and paranoia which brings about their mortality. The film was shot in the city of Amiens over a four-week period and premiered at the 2nd Annual Convention of the Fantastique in Paris in April 1973 and was initially met with a negative reception and as a result, Rollin was unable to find anyone to back his future personal projects.Rollin directed the adult sex films Jeunes filles impudiques (Schoolgirl Hitchhikers), Le sourire vertical (The Vertical Smile), and Tout le monde il en a deux (Bacchanales sexuelles or Fly Me the French Way) under the pseudonym Michel Gentil as he was financially unable to come up with a budget for another mainstream feature film. However, in 1974 Rollin directed the horror adventure and self-proclaimed \"Expressionist\" film Les dÃ©moniaques which was inspired by the adventure classics he had enormous admiration for in his youth. The film includes JoÃ«lle CÅur and Willy Braque whom Rollin worked with on Jeunes filles impudiques. The story follows two young women who have been involved in a shipwreck and are brutally raped and murdered by a group of rogue pirates, only to be resurrected after making love to the devil so that they can seek their revenge. Rollin had many disputes with the producers of the film during production of the project as they insisted on a low budget. He was hospitalized for two weeks following the work due to mental and physical exhaustion. Further problems would arise including the working title, Les diablesses, having to be changed as the copyright was not free of charge and with the Castel Twins being unavailable for the roles of the avenging ghosts, the parts where offered to inexperienced actresses Lieva Lone and Patricia Hermenier.Rollin made a brief return to the erotic vampire genre in 1975 when he wrote and directed LÃ¨vres de sang (Lips of Blood). The film includes all the surreal dreamlike aspects for which Rollin's films are known. The story follows a young man named Frederic who is on a quest to find a woman dressed in white following the discovery of a photo of a ruined chÃ¢teau. The photo triggers a suppressed childhood memory, which may be a dream. Despite his mother trying to convince him that it was dream, Frederic becomes fixated and obsessed with location the castle and the woman that may be inside. LÃ¨vres de sang features Jean-Loup Philippe, whom Rollin co-wrote the film with, Annie Belle, and Nathalie Perrey, whom Rollin had worked with frequently throughout his career as a credited actress, script writer and editor. The film also sees the return of the Castel Twins as part of a group of vampires.\nDue to the commercial failures of both La rose de fer and LÃ¨vres de sang, Rollin again had no choice but to direct another adult sex film for financial reasons as there was no possible way to produce a feature film for the foreseeable future. Phantasmes (Once Upon a Virgin) was written and directed by Rollin for release in 1975 and was the first and only pornographic film in which he was credited under his own name because he liked what he did in the film. Rollin mentioned that the film is his \"first and final attempt at a serious\" adult film, wanting to create a film that didn't just \"poke fun at sex\". The score for Phantasmes is considered one of the films best attributes, courtesy of composer Didier William Lepauw of LÃ¨vres de sang.Between 1976 and 1977, his work consisted strictly of hardcore pornographic films as there was a lack of money and producers reluctant to fund any new mainstream projects due to his previous commercial failures. Seven porn films were produced within this period under his pseudonym Michel Gentil, and one of which, Suce moi vampire (Suck Me Vampire: the hardcore version of LÃ¨vres de sang), he credited himself as Michel Gand. His 1976 hardcore film Douces pÃ©nÃ©traitions marked the final time the Castel Twins would appear together working for Rollin, and the final time Marie-Pierre would work with him altogether. Catherine would continue to appear in his films for several years.\nJean Rollin returned in 1978, when he wrote and directed Les raisins de la mort (The Grapes of Death) which has been considered the first French gore film. It has been described as one of the most pivotal films in his entire canon and is seen as a rare departure from his usual dreamlike and poetic works. Following the negative reception and commercial failures of his previous films and having to direct pornographic pictures, Rollin eventually gained financial backing to produce his next mainstream feature. The story here features a young woman, Elisabeth (Marie-Georges Pascal) who is travelling to a secluded vineyard in the mountains owned by her fiancÃ©. There she discovers that the local residents who occupy the village have been transformed into mindless zombies by a dangerous pesticide which contaminated the grapes growing at the vineyard following a wine festival which occurred some days before.\nThe film includes pornographic actress Brigitte Lahaie, in her first mainstream role, as Rollin was the first French director to recognise her acting capabilities and offer her much more prominent roles in his subsequent films. Rollin stated that Les raisins de la mort was his \"first traditional, almost conventional, production\" which was because the film acquired solid finances with made a change and with special effects supplied by Italian experts. Claude Becognee served as director of photography which added to the film's success. Rollin would credit much of the film's success to Marie-Georges Pascal's portrayal of Elisabeth, whom he would recall delivered a very \"moving\" performance in the film. Les raisins de la mort was shot in the deserted mountain region of Les CÃ©vennes.\nThe film is often referred to as being influenced by George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead. However, it has more in common with Jorge Grau's 1974 Spanish-Italian horror film Let Sleeping Corpses Lie (also known as The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue). The film does not follow the tradition zombie method, instead, Rollin's zombies centre on madness with a strong environmentally conscious message. As he has mentioned, the zombies \"have retained their consciousness\" and they finally \"suffer for what they are\". With the film as a notable success, Rollin would continue with pornographic films under a new pseudonym, Robert Xavier, while retaining the Michel Gentil credit.\nIn 1979, and now established as a somewhat successful director, Rollin created Fascination in which he returned to the roots of the fantastique genre his early works are known for. The film is inspired by the short story Un verre de sang (A Glass of Blood) from French poet Jean Lorrain with tells the tale of wealthy French people, who, at the turn of the century, begin to drink the blood of bulls in order to cure anemia. The title of the film refers to and pays homage to a French magazine of the same name which is dedicated to different forms of eroticism in art. Rollin's story of Fascination differs slightly from that of Lorrain's novel, in that, in the year 1905 a group of wealthy Parisian women arrive at an abattoir to drink the blood of an ox as it is believed to be a curative for anemia. The central story follows two lovers Elizabeth and Eva (Franca MaÃ¯ and Brigitte Lahaie respectively), chambermaids-in-waiting who reside at a deserted castle and are suddenly interrupted by a thief named Mark (Jean-Pierre Lemaire), who takes refuge at the castle in order to hide from a group of thieves he has stolen coins from. When Mark makes love to Eva, she is forced to go outside and confront the thieves in the nearby stables to make a deal; she is forced to have sex with one of the male thieves and subsequently they are murdered by Eva in an iconic scene with Eva wielding a scythe. It is soon revealed that Elizabeth and Eva are expecting a group of women to arrive where sensual love making takes place and the women are revealed to devour the blood of humans.\nThe film is often said to be of the vampire genre. However, it does not feature the elements which his early vampire films are known for, aside from the drinking of blood. The production of Fascination was not without complications; as it may have been one of the easiest films to shot in Rollin's experience, despite the low budget, the story was met with disapproval from the film's producer, Christine Renaud. As Rollin himself had said, the \"co-producer wanted (him) to make a very explicit sex film-straight exploitation fare without too much emphasis on the fantastical elements\". Rollin overcame these obstacles and made the film he wanted. Additional members of the crew included Nathalie Perrey, who designed the costumes, and Philippe D'Aram, who provided the score. It was predicted that Fascination would lead to success, as did Les raisins de la mort. However, in a setback, one of the directors of UGC, a huge French distributor, cancelled the screenings Rollin had been promised. As the film was yet another financial failure for Rollin, he had little choice but to resume his pornographic works with continued until the end of the 1970s.\n\n1980s\nAs Jean Rollin's career continued into the 1980s, he started off the decade with the release of La nuit des traquÃ©es (The Night of the Hunted) in the summer of 1980. This mainstream feature saw the return of pornographic actress Brigitte Lahaie, in her first leading role in a Rollin film. Upon the film's debut, it was considered a failure. However, it eventually garnered somewhat of a following in later years, as several of Rollin's works have done in the past. La nuit des traquÃ©es was shot in less than ten days on an extremely low budget, similar to his pornographic films. Rollin admitted that \"I was tired of X-films\", as the film was intended to be another hardcore sex film and told the producer \"if you want a horror film for the same cost\", then, \"I can make it in 9 days\". Rollin came to the decision to cast actors of the pornographic industry in the picture in order to keep production cost down and to give the actors the opportunity to show their legitimate talent. The film stands as a noteworthy piece of work in Rollin's canon, as it differs from any of his previous work and is a departure from the fantastique genre that his films are greatly known for; the film is often poetic, yet it serves a realistic tone and chilling atmosphere. Lahaie portrays the character of Elizabeth, a young woman discovered wandering around in the rain on a dark night, by a man named Robert (Vincent GardÃ¨re). As Elizabeth has no recollection of why she is there and frequently continues to lose her memory every few minutes, Robert drives her to his apartment in the city where they make love. The following morning while Robert goes to work, a doctor named Francis and a woman named Solange (Bernard Papineau and Rachel Mhas) locate Elizabeth and accompany her back to the clinic where she has escaped from. It is revealed that Elizabeth and fellow patients are currently confined to the hospital for a deteriorating disease in which they have been contaminated by an environmental accident.\nIn addition to Lahaie, Rollin had actress Martine Delva in mind for the role of Lahaie's character's friend VÃ©ronique. Delva was introduced to Rollin and Lionel Wallman by actor Alain Plumey and when offered the role, she accepted the role. Prior to production, which was intended to take place in La DÃ©fense district, she was involved in a serious car accident which left her unconscious with a broken leg and she died within one week from her injuries. The role of VÃ©ronique then offered to Dominique Journet. Pornographic actress Catherine Greiner and frequent collaborator, Natalie Perrey appeared as patients at the hospital.\nIn the early year of the film, it was met with a negative reception and did not please audiences during its release; not receiving a successful response at the StigÃ¨s Festival,. It did however receive positive reaction when it was screened at a festival in Trieste, where it was applauded and viewed as a highly subversive work. Rollin himself had stated that \"I don't think it is a very good film and it is probably one of my worst\" and that if he could remake just one of his films it would be La nuit des traquÃ©es.In 1980, Rollin directed the Spanish zombie horror feature, Le lac des morts vivants (commonly known as Zombie Lake) under the pseudonym J.A. Lazer. JÃ©sus Franco was intended to direct the film, and with an unfortunate turn of events he became unavailable. At this point, Rollin was planning to take a vacation, and on the morning he was expecting to leave, he received a phone call from the production company EurocinÃ© asking if he would be interested directing the horror film which was due to start filming the next morning, as Franco could not be located. Rollin agreed, and arrived on set the following morning. The company could not attach Rollin's name to the project due to issues with the contact, as a Spanish name had to be credited for the film and J.A. Lazer was chosen. Le lac des morts vivants was released in 1981 and Rollin admitted that he never really cared for the film. It contains most of the elements which one would expect from a Franco film, and includes Franco's frequent collaborators such as actors Howard Vernon, Nadine Pascal, Antonio Mayans and Alain Petit, and composer Daniel White. Photography for the film was courtesy of Max Monteillet, who Rollin would later work with in several projects. Rollin himself made a cameo appearance in the film.In 1981, Rollin returned with the drama film, Les paumÃ©es du petit matin (The Escapees or The Runaways). It marks a departure to the usual horror tones which his films are notable for, and here mixes drama with elements of adventure, thriller and crime, while maintaining erotic and poetic themes and remains a distinctive and unique piece of work from Rollin. The story follows two young women who are confined to mental asylum in the countryside; Michelle (Laurence Dubas), a troubled teenager, has been returned to the asylum after escaping and is forced into a straitjacket. She manages to get the attention of Marie (Christiane CoppÃ©), a teenage girl who is who sits in the garden on a rocking chair, while staring into space and never speaks, by dropping a tin food dish from her bedroom window and the sound somehow brings Marie back to reality. They escape from the asylum and encounter a group of burlesque dancers, a bar singer and a group of women who proceed to rape Marie. Their journey ends when they become involved in crime and death. The cast includes Rollin's usual collaborators Louise Dhour, Nathalie Perrey, Brigitte Lahie and a cameo appearance from Rollin himself. Les paumÃ©es du petit matin unfortunately failed to receive a proper theatrical in 1981 which resulted in it being one of the most difficult Rollin films to find in future. It did however receive its first DVD release in 2009 in the United States courtesy of Redemption Films, with a subsequent release in the United Kingdom. Again with a limited budget an issues with the script, Rollin stated that there were many problems with the production right from the beginning; that it was \"an incredible mess\", filled with \"clichÃ©s and platitudes of melodrama.\" Later reviews of the film have been quite positive; Cathal Tohill and Pete Tombs would go so far as to call it a schizophrenic work in their wonderful Immoral Tales, but they would also note that \"the beginning and end are pure Rollin\" and \"what is good in (The Escapees) is very good.\"\nHis 1982 film, La morte vivante (The Living Dead Girl) was his most commercial and successful work since Les raisins de la mort. In addition to its small budget, Rollin again had to contend with producers to construct a film that he wanted, as they required another zombie piece. He was reluctant to do so and was influenced to create a film with combinations from his previous works. Rollin described that the living dead girl is sort of a vampire woman who devours the blood of humans, taking the idea from his vampire works, but not exactly making her a vampire. The gore is a notable aspect taken from Les raisins de la mort. His usual poetic, supernatural and horror themes are still present within the film. Rollin created the story of a young woman named Catherine Valmont (FranÃ§oise Blanchard) who has been dead and buried in her family vault beneath the Valmont mansion for the past two years. As three thieves enter the vaults and plan to rob Catherine and her deceased relative of their jewellery as they lay in their coffins, an earth tremor occurs, which suddenly resurrects Catherine. Unaware of her surroundings, she must acquire human victims and drink their blood to prevent her descending into madness and possibly death, with drifting in and out of childhood memories of her childhood friend, HÃ©lÃ¨ne (Marina Pierro). During which, a photographer, Barbara (Carina Barone), becomes fascinated by Catherine when she discovers her and thinks she is quite peculiar, and sets out to uncover a mystery. Catherine's childhood friend, HÃ©lÃ¨ne is intending to buy the Valmont mansion, which is currently on the market and a strange phone call leads her to the home where she discovers that Catherine is alive and the bodies of the thieves and the real estate agent and her boyfriend. Trying to convince herself that Catherine did not actually die, she realises that she has returned from the dead and must help her by bringing her unsuspecting victims. Some of the financing for the film was courtesy of Jacques Raif, who co-wrote the feature. The film's photographer Pierre LeBlond, found a castle which would become the Valmont mansion, which they rented. The castle provided accommodation for the cast and crew, in which the owner offered to cook. According to Rollin, the owner insisted on being referred to as \"His Lordship\" and that he was very difficult to get along with  Actress, FranÃ§oise Blanchard was introduced to Rollin by Fanny Magier, a co-star actress who appeared in the film. When Blanchard arrived, Rollin was unsure whether to offer her the role of Catherine due to the fact that in the first scene in which her character is resurrected, Blanchard appeared wearing trousers which wasn't required for the scene and Rollin did not ask her to remove them. She did however receive the role due to good contact. Blanchard showed great professionalism in her role and in one particular scene, the final scene of the film, in which Blanchard's character cries and screams after devouring her childhood friend, the crew became concerned over her mental state as they thought she has descended into madness. She gave an amazing performance for the role. During the preparation of the film, Rollin had been to Rome with Lionel Wallman to find an actress to portray the role of HÃ©lÃ¨ne. Rollin had Teresa Ann Savoy in mind for the role, whom he was greatly impressed with. After speaking with Savoy and showing her a script for a pornographic picture which was in English and devoid of interest and not for La morte vivante, as she didn't speak French, she refused the role and told her agent that she would never in her life shoot with a guy like him. His second choice was actress Marina Pierro, a recurring collaborator with director Walerian Borowczyk, whom Rollin instantly liked. Pierro accepted the role. In the role of the photographers, American actor Mike Marshall, whom Rollin enjoyed working with during the production received the role of Greg and Canadian actress Carina Barone, was offered the role of Barbara due to a previous actress who featured in Les paumÃ©es du petit matin turning it down as she unmistakable believed that it was supposedly an erotic film. The film was a commercial success within theatres and received quite a positive reception, especially in Italy. Upon its release, Rollin was betrayed by a dishonest distributor who premiered in a select number of small theatres behind his back, as the film deserved a much larger audience in highly established theatres. However, La morte vivante was selected in many festivals which gave the film little success, particularly in Rome where Rollin's friend, Andriano Pintaldi presented the film in his festival where it was given the public's award.After directing three additional pornographic features following La morte Vivante, Rollin's next feature film, Les trottoirs de Bangkok (The Sidewalks of Bangkok) was released in 1984. It is a rare production for Rollin, in that it does not contain his traditional fare of the supernatural, horror, or the fantastique genre. It is highly influenced by Rollin's childhood passion for old serials as it contains themes of adventure, crime and mystery, comic-book fantasy and is inspired by the 1932 Boris Karloff classic The Mask of Fu Manchu. The leading protagonist of the film is pornographic actress, Yoko, whom Rollin mentioned that he had \"never worked with an actor who was so open-minded and easy to direct.\" She portrays the role of Eva, who is on the run from the French Secret Service and a rival syndicate who desperate require a deadly chemical which she possesses. This is her only mainstream role outside of the pornographic industry. FranÃ§oise Blanchard returns in her second film with Rollin, as she appears in the role of Claudine, a woman who works for the syndicate and is forced to locate Eva and hand her over to her villainous boss, instead she chooses to protect Eva. Supporting cast includes Argentina actor GÃ©rard Landry, Israeli actress Brigitte Borghese, Jean-Pierre Bouyxou, whom Rollin has worked with on numerous occasions throughout his career, and a cameo appearance from Rollin. On a limited budget, and again working with producer Lionel Wallman and cinematographer Claude Becognee, the production of Les trottoris de Bangkok was filmed in several locations, many of which were not given permission to; the Chinese Quarter of Porte d'Italie and on the docks where goods from Asia were unloaded, an abandoned den near the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es, and on part of the French railroad. The film became a success and Rollin admitted that despite the fact that the film was a mess, he said \"the entire shoot was great fun.\" Working with Yoko prompted Rollin to write a new film which included her alongside Brigitte Lahaie which unfortunately never became a film as Yoko retired from acting in the early nineties.Rollin received minor work following Les trottoirs de Bangkok; in 1985, he resumed his pseudonymous work as \"Michel Gentil\" with a non-pornographic feature, the slapstick comedy, Ne prends pas les poulets pour des pigeons which reunited Brigitte Borghese and GÃ©rard Landry from his previous film, and included French actor and comedian Popeck. Rollin was hired, and therefore his real name was not attached to the project. In 1988, he received the uncredited directorial role in the erotic sequel Emmanuelle 6, for which he wrote the screenplay. The film suffered many flaws during production under direction from Bruno Zincone and Rollin became involved in an attempt to salvage what he could and see that production was completed for the financiers.At the end of the decade, Rollin created Perdues dans New York (Lost in New York) which was produced in 1989. Rollin mentioned that the film was \"an anthology of all the themes and obsessive images I have used in my films\", and that it, \"brought to an end what had been started within the previous 13 films.\" A friend of Rollin's who was a producer insisted his help as he need location shots of New York an upcoming TV series he was working on. Rollin agreed and travelled to New York with a small film crew and a 16mm camera. While filming the shots, Rollin was struck with an idea to improvise a theme in which two young women are separated and desperately search for one another. He produced the film with a runtime of just under one hour and immediately struggled to find distribution, whether it be released to theatres or television. It was difficult to find distribution for independent and exploitation pictures in the late eighties as in a time of revolution and change, distributors would only pick up more commercial and high-budget film. It was not until the following years that the film found its audience on the home video market. Initially, Perdues dans New York was to be the final production of Rollin's canon as he has become ill during this period, and he expressed gratitude to his many fan by paying homage to his early works.\nDespite his intentions to retire from directing following Perdues dans New York, his final film of the 1980s, Killing Car (working title Femme dangereuse) was produced in 1989. It is a revenge thriller and one of his most underrated and overlooked works. Initially intended to be a softcore production under the Michel Gentil pseudonym, Rollin attached his own name to the project and made it one of his most personal and self-referential of all his works. The film was shot on 16mm and in less than a week on a minimal budget of under $100,000. Australian model Tiki Tsang, originally of Brisbane, Queensland, had been residing in Paris, France for sometime when she was discovered by Rollin and offered her the role of \"The Car Woman\", a strange woman who steals an old Buick and proceeds to kill a number of people to seek revenge for a past tragedy. The part of \"The Car Woman\" was written especially for Tsang in what is the only film credit to her name. Killing Car gives nod to previous Rollin works including Tsang emerging from a grandfather clock (as did Dominique in an iconic scene from Les frisson des vampires). Max Monteillet returned as cinematographer and Philippe Brejean provided the score. Cast includes recurring collaborators Jean-Pierre Bouyxou and Jean-Loup Philippe. Following the production, Rollin was hospitalized due to exhaustion and started editing the film after his recovery. The editing process lasted two years. Several problems would arise during post-production, as the film found it difficult to receive distribution, like Perdues dans New York, if it could not receive a theatrical distribution, Rollin would settle for a video or television release. The film was eventually released in 1993. It was announced that no usable print or negative of the film exists today, and all known film negatives are considered lost.\n\n1990s\nRollin's final adult production came in 1994 when he made a brief return to direct (uncredited) and wrote the scenario for Le Parfume de Mathilde (The Scent of Mathilde). Rollin was initially required as a screenwriter for the production due to the fact that he was to replace producer Marc Dorcel's in-house auteur Michele Ricaud, who has just recently passed away. However, Rollin became co-director of the made-for-video film. Following his final time working on a sex film, Rollin later returned to his traditional works when he would go on to resume what he was best known for.Rollin continued his career into the 1990s, following what was intended to be a brief return in 1994 when he directed and wrote a final pornographic film. He remained true to form for what were to be his final years of film making, and his next feature went into production in 1995; Les deux orphelines vampires (The Two Orphan Vampires) saw the return of his most recognizable work, and his first vampire film since 1975's Levres de sang. With the then recent increase in popularity of Rollin's works, and with the resurgence with the vampire genre in general, most notable with Bram Stoker's Dracula, this prompted Rollin to create a new vampire feature, quite different from Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 blockbuster, as he stated that it was \"not a good film at all\", and that \"it just doesn't work for one second\". The idea of the film was based upon Rollin's novel of the same name and went into production in June 1995 for a mere â£3,000,000, which is actually more than his prior works received. Locations for the shoot included four days in New York at the beginning, with the remaining three weeks in Paris. Cinematography was provided by Norbert Marfaing-Sintes, who previously worked with Italian director Duccio Tessari, as Max Monteillet was not available. Nathalie Perrey introduced Rollin to Marfaing-Sintes, as she had experience working with Marfaing-Sintes in many films; to show his gratitude, Rollin offered Perrey a role in Les deux orphelines vampires. The leading roles were offered to two inexperienced actresses, Alexandra Pic and Isabelle Teboul, whom Rollin choose while answering a newspaper ad they had printed. Brigitte Lahaie received a minor role in the film. Following an extensive period in post-production, the film was eventually released on 9 July 1997.\nHis next directorial feature, La fiancÃ©e de Dracula (The FiancÃ©e of Dracula) went into production in 1999. Rollin had written the screenplay for the film, as he did with many of his previous works. During which time, Rollin was receiving dialysis for kidney disease and for periods of time, did not remain with the film crew and production was shared with Jean-NoÃ«l Delamarre in his absence, while Rolling was staying at a hotel in Caen. Filming locations included the islands of Chausey where the majority of the filming took place, a cemetery in Ãpinay-ChamplÃ¢treux, a castle in Blandy, Seine-et-Marne, and port of Pourville-lÃ¨s-Dieppes. Long-time collaborators Brigitte Lahaie, Catherine Castel and Nathalie Perrey returned for prominent roles in the film. Rollin's niece, Sandrine Thoquet appeared in the film as a young vampire burned by the rays of the sun. Following production, Rollin received a kidney transplant in October 2000 during the post-production which lasted for almost two years. The film was successfully shown in theatres on 14 August 2002, for which Rollin was not completely satisfied of the release date. However, he was pleased that it was released to theaters and was somewhat well received.\n\nPersonal life and death\nRollin was married to Simone Rollin Roth Le Gentil (nÃ©e Morel), with whom he had two sons, Serge and Carel. He was married to Simone until his death.\nRollin died on 15 December 2010 after a long battle with cancer and was survived by his wife Simone, son Serge and granddaughter Gabrielle. He is buried at PÃ¨re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

Her most notable work is that of her role in the 1982 French film La morte vivante, directed by Jean Rollin. Blanchard had collaborated with Rollin on several occasions in films Les trottoirs de Bangkok (1984), Ã la poursuite de Barbara (1991) and La nuit des horloges (2007). She had worked frequently with directors Richard Balducci and JesÃºs Franco. She was also known for her work as a voice artist, having dubbed films, such as, Robert Altman's Popeye (1980), The NeverEnding Story III (1994) and Hackers (1995), and animated television series, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Totally Spies!\n\nCareer\nBlanchard's career stretched from between the late 1970s until the early 1990s. She may have been best known for playing Catherine Valmont in 1982 horror La Morte Vivante (The Living Dead Girl), a film from Jean Rollin.\nShe also appeared in films by directors Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei. She recalled her career in an interview, which was featured on the Encore release of La Morte Vivante, she mentioned that it was a tragedy and a coincidence that started her career in the late 1970s. While trying to make ends meet as a hand model, she lost her brother in the late 1970. Around that same time she was offered her first role, coincidentally as someone who had also lost a family member. FranÃ§oise approached the part skeptically as she remembered that at that time she was, \"aggressive against people but also a bit confused\" due to the death of her brother. She enjoyed the experience and took a serious interest in acting, so decided to take acting lessons afterwards.Blanchard soon became involved in several B movies when her career quickly became intertwined with the legendary Eurocine company. \"I liked the feel of these B movies, especially horror\", FranÃ§oise noted to Encore, which perhaps explains why she became so popular to several of the most noteworthy genre directors of the late 1970s. She also mentioned that she didn't mind nudity and even went so far as to pose for Lui Magazine in the early 1980s. After several films directors such as Pierre Chevalier, FranÃ§oise took a role in Bruno Mattei's Caligula and Messalina in 1981. The following year she appeared in Jess Franco's Revenge In The House Of Usher, and she liked Franco and admired his creativity and fire.She then appeared in the La Morte Vivante with Rollin. The night shoot on the film was mostly difficult and there were many problems with the special effects but, despite some disagreements, she liked and admired Rollin and admitted to Encore that, \"he is really nice and is very much there\". She enjoyed working with and admired her co-star in the film, Italian actress Marina Pierro, and noted, \"she is very maternal with me.\" FranÃ§oise worked again with Rollin in Les Trottoirs De Bangkok (The Sidewalks Of Bangkok), a film which she had a lot of fun making, and she appeared in his newest film production La nuit des horloges (The Night of Clocks) opposite Ovidie.\n\nDeath\nBlanchard died on 24 May 2013, twelve days before her 59th birthday. The cause of death was not disclosed.\n\nFilmography\nPassage 7:\nGiulio Questi\nGiulio Questi (18 March 1924 â 3 December 2014) was an Italian film director and screenwriter.Questi was born in Bergamo.  He wrote short stories and filmed several documentaries before he started as assistant director and script writer in the movie business.\nHe is best known for the films La morte ha fatto l'uovo and Django Kill! (If You Live Shoot!).\nQuesti died in Rome, aged 90.\n\nFilmography\nPassage 8:\nMr. Right (2009 film)\nMr. Right is a 2009 British film directed by David Morris and Jacqui Morris. The jointly-made gay-themed film is the debut for both directors.\n\nSynopsis\nThe film presents life of a number of individuals who live in London's Soho area in their quest for their \"Mr. Right\". One of the highlights of the film is when all the characters gather for an excruciatingly awkward and hilarious dinner party at which wine and secrets are spilled.\nHarry (James Lance) is a TV producer but dreams to get way. He loves Alex (Luke de Woolfson), an aspiring yet insecure actor who also works as a caterer. Meanwhile Alex is struggling to create an identity for himself and decides to live independently through monetary help from his brother despite Harry wanting him back\nTom (David Morris, the co-director of the film) is a successful art dealer who is in a precarious relationship with Lars (Benjamin Hart), a handsome sometime-model. Tom finds excuses for Lars' flings so long as Lars doesn't leave him. Meanwhile Lars has this attraction to Harry and can't get over his feelings\nWilliam (Rocky Marshall) a divorced former rugby player finds it difficult very difficult to parent his nine-year-old daughter Georgie while trying to get on a new relationship with Lawrence (Leon Ockenden), a striving soap actor. Their relationship is complicated as Georgie is intent on sabotaging his relationship.\nLouise (Georgia Zaris), a fag hag, is dating Paul (Jeremy Edwards), but suspects Paul is gay. Paul is slowly but surely getting drawn into the gay scene, despite visibly and verbally protesting every step of the way.By the end of the film three months later, the characters are still striving to make new paths for themselves. Harry is appealing for Alex, now in a small studio residence to return, but the latter turns him gently down despite having feelings for him. Things are much better between William and Lawrence as Georgie becomes more accepting of their relationship. Things have soured between Lars and William. Devastated Lars catches Harry while the latter has just packed to leave everything behind for his long-planned trip away from his dreaded work. Meanwhile Paul is getting more and more into the gay scene despite putting a brave face that he is still straight.\n\nCast\nMainJames Lance as Harry\nLuke de Woolfson as Alex\nDavid Morris as Tom\nBenjamin Hart as Lars\nRocky Marshall as William\nLeon Ockenden as Lawrence\nGeorgia Zaris as Louise\nJeremy Edwards as PaulOthersJan Waters as Harry's Mother\nMaddie Planer as Georgie, Williams's daughter\nSheila Kidd as William's mother\nAndrew Dunn as Alex's Father\nKaren Meagher as Alex's Mother\nRick Warden as Alex's Brother\nKaty Odey as Presenter\nLucy Jules as Emma\nSarah Carleton as Waitress\nDolly Wells as Fizz\nHarry Serjeant as Runner\nIan Tytler as Charlie\nJim Cole as Heath\nArchie Kidd as Barnaby\nHeather Bleasdale as Barnaby's Mother\nYvonne O'Grady as Business Woman\nMax Karie as Marcel\nKate Russell as The Yellow Team\nIan Russell as The Yellow Team\nMark Hayford as The Blue Team\nDiane Morgan as The Blue Team\nTerry Bird as Red Team\nCheryl Fergison as Red Team\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Salute! Motherland\").\"Sri Lanka Matha\" was first performed at an official ceremony on 4 February 1949 at the Independence Memorial Hall in Torrington Square during the national day ceremony. The anthem was given full constitutional recognition in the 1978 Second Republican Constitution.\n\nHistory\nThere are differing accounts as to the origin of the \"Sri Lanka Matha\". The most widely held view is that Sri Lankan composer Ananda Samarakoon wrote the music and lyrics to the song, inspired/influenced by the Indian Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore. A minority suggest that Tagore wrote the anthem in full. Some have suggested that Tagore wrote the music whilst Samarakoon wrote the lyrics. Tagore being directly involved in the creation of the song has been denied by some historians like Indian Lipi Ghosh and Sri Lankan Sandagomi Coperahewa. Samarakoon had been a pupil of Tagore at Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan. After returning to Ceylon Samarakoon taught music at Mahinda College, Galle. The song, which was then known as \"Namo Namo Mata\", was first sung by students at Mahinda College. After it was sung by the choir from Musaeus College, Colombo at a public event it became hugely popular in Ceylon and was widely played on radio.Prior to Ceylon's independence (1948) the Lanka Gandharva Sabha had organised a competition to find a national anthem. Among the entries were \"Namo Namo Matha\" by Samarakoon and \"Sri Lanka Matha Pala Yasa Mahima\" by P. B. Illangasinghe and Lionel Edirisinghe. The latter won the competition but this was controversial as Illangasinghe and Edirisinghe were members of the judging panel. \"Sri Lanka Matha Pala Yasa Mahima\" was broadcast by Radio Ceylon on the morning of 4 February 1948, independence day, but it was not sung at the official Freedom Day celebrations. Ceylon continued to use the UK's national anthem as its official national anthem after independence. At the first independence day ceremony held on 4 February 1949 at the Independence Memorial Hall in Torrington Square both \"Namo Namo Matha\" and \"Sri Lanka Matha Pala Yasa Mahima\" were sung, in Sinhala and Tamil, as \"national songs\".More specifically, in 1950 Minister of Finance J. R. Jayewardene requested that the government recognise Samarakoon's \"Namo Namo Matha\" as the official national anthem. The government appointed a committee headed by Edwin Wijeyeratne, Minister of Home Affairs and Rural Development, to pick a new national anthem. The committee heard several songs but, after much deliberation, picked \"Namo Namo Matha\". The committee made a minor change to Samarakoon's song, with his approval, changing the tenth line from \"Nawajeewana Damine Newatha Apa Awadi Karan Matha\" to \"Nawa Jeewana Demine Nithina Apa Pubudu Karan Matha\". The committee's decision was endorsed by the government on 22 November 1951. The anthem was translated into the Tamil language by M. Nallathamby. \"Namo Namo Matha\" was first sung as Ceylon's official national anthem at the independence day parade in Colombo in 1952.In the late 1950s controversy arose over its first line, \"Namo Namo Matha, Apa Sri Lanka\". It was deemed to be \"unlucky\" and blamed for the country's misfortunes including the deaths of two prime ministers. In February 1961 the government changed the line to their present form, \"Sri Lanka Matha, Apa Sri Lanka\", despite Samarakoon's strong opposition. Samarakoon committed suicide in April 1962, leaving a note complaining that its lyrics had been mutilated.The Second Republican Constitution of 1978 gave \"Sri Lanka Matha\" constitutional recognition.\n\nMultilingual\nThe Sri Lankan national anthem is available in an identical version in two languages, Sinhala and Tamil, both official languages of the country. It is just one of a number that are sung in more than one language: Belgium (French, Dutch, and German), Canada (English, French and Inuktitut), Finland (Finnish, Swedish), New Zealand (English and MÄori), South Africa (Xhosa, Zulu, Sesotho, Afrikaans and English), Suriname (Dutch and Sranan Tongo) and Switzerland (German, French, Italian and Romansh).\"Sri Lanka Thaaye\", the Tamil version of the Sri Lankan national anthem, is an exact translation of \"Sri Lanka Matha\", the Sinhala version, and has the same music. Although it has existed since independence in 1948 it was generally only sung in the north and east of the country where the Tamil language predominates. The Sinhala version of the Constitution uses Sinhala lyrics while the Tamil version of the constitution uses Tamil lyrics. Per the constitution both Sinhala and Tamil are official and national languages and thus the anthem could be sung in both languages.The majority of Sri Lankans (around 75%) speak the Sinhala language. More specifically, \"Tamil is the native language for the Tamil people, who constitute about 15% of Sri Lankans, and for Muslims who are nearly 10%\", according to the BBC. Until early 2016, the Sinhala version was the only one to be used during official government events and it was the only version used during international sports and other events. Although the Sinhala version of the anthem was used at official/state events, the Tamil version was also sung at some events in spite of the unofficial ban which ended in early 2016. \nThe Sinhala version of Sri Lanka Matha was used in all parts of the country with the exception of the North and the East which have a large Tamil population. Some reports indicate that the Tamil version was used at official events held in the Tamil speaking regions in the North and East of Sri Lanka. The Tamil version was sung at Tamil medium schools throughout the country. The Tamil version was even used during the period when Sinhala was the only official language of the country (1956â87).\n\nTamil version controversy\nOn 12 December 2010 The Sunday Times reported that the Cabinet of Sri Lanka headed by President Mahinda Rajapaksa had taken the decision to scrap the Tamil translation of \"Sri Lanka Matha\" at official and state functions, as \"in no other country was the national anthem used in more than one language\" - even though the national anthems of Belgium, Switzerland, Canada and those of several other countries have more than one language version. The Cabinet's decision had followed a paper on the national flag and national anthem produced by Public Administration and Home Affairs Minister W. D. J. Senewiratne. The paper had drawn on the Singaporean model where the national anthem is sung in the official lyrics and not any translation of the lyrics. Based on this the paper recommended that the Sri Lankan national anthem only be sung in Sinhala and the Tamil translation be abolished. The paper's authors had failed to realise that the official lyrics of the Singaporean national anthem are in Malay, a minority language (75% of Singaporeans are Chinese).Government minister Wimal Weerawansa had labelled the Tamil version a \"joke\" on Derana TV, and had cited India as an analogy. Some journalists, such as D. B. S. Jeyaraj, claimed that it was wrong of Weerawansa  to cite India as an analogy because according to them the Indian national anthem was not in Hindi, which is the most widely spoken language of India, but in Bengali, a minority language. Although sources based on an official Government of India website state that the Indian National anthem was adopted in its Hindi version by the Constituent Assembly of India, the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly of India on 24 January 1950 does not mention that the National Anthem was \"adopted\", nor does it mention that it was done so in its Hindi version. In actual practice the unaltered Bengali version is the version sung as the National Anthem, with its words in original Bengali Tatsama, a highly Sanskritized form of Bengali that has Sanskrit words common to both Hindi and Bengali.The Cabinet's December 2010 decision to scrap the Tamil translation of the anthem (which was not subsequently enacted) caused much furore in Sri Lanka. Later, the government denied allegations that the Tamil translation was to be abolished. The Presidential Secretariat has stated that there was no basis to the media report and follow up reports which intimated the same. Nevertheless, an unofficial ban on the Tamil version came into being as fearful public officials in Tamil speaking areas stopped using the Tamil version or blocked attempts to use it. The Sri Lankan Army forcefully stopped any use of the Tamil version and taught school children to sing only the Sinhala version.In March 2015 newly elected President Maithripala Sirisena announced that he would be issuing a circular which would state that there was no ban on singing the national anthem in Tamil. Sirisena's announcement was attacked by Sinhalese Buddhist nationalists.During Sri Lanka's 68th national independence day celebrations on 4 February 2016, the Tamil version of the anthem was sung for the first time since 1949 at an official government event, the independence day celebrations. Lifting of the unofficial ban on the Tamil version had been approved by President Maithripala Sirisena (who had said he would unite the nation after the nearly 26-year civil war that ended in 2009) and by others in the government. This step was viewed as part of the plan for \"post-civil war ethnic reconciliation\".Naturally, Sri Lanka Matha was also sung in Sinhalese. Some groups, and Sri Lanka's former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, were opposed to the government officially allowing the Tamil version to be sung.In 2020, the Sri Lankan government stopped using the Tamil version of the national anthem at the main Independence Day celebration. However, regional independence day celebrations including those with government involvement in regions with significant Tamil populations continue to sing in both Tamil and Sinhala.\n\nLyrics\nSinhala version\nTamil version\nPoetic English translation\nNotes\nSee also\nSri Lankan Civil War\nTamil Eelam\nPassage 2:\nThe Devil Went Down to Georgia\n\"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\" is a song written and performed by the Charlie Daniels Band and released on their 1979 album Million Mile Reflections.The song is written in the key of D minor. Although uncredited, Vassar Clements originally wrote the basic melody an octave lower, in a tune called \"Lonesome Fiddle Blues\" released on Clements' self-titled 1975 album on which Charlie Daniels played guitar. The Charlie Daniels Band moved it up an octave and put words to it. The song's verses are closer to being spoken rather than sung (i.e., recitation), and tell the story of a young man named Johnny, in a variant on the classic deal with the Devil. The performances of the Devil and Johnny are played as instrumental bridges. The song was the band's biggest hit, reaching No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, prevented from further chart movement by \"After the Love Has Gone\" by Earth, Wind and Fire and \"My Sharona\" by The Knack.\n\nContent\nThe song tells a story about the Devil's failure to gain a young man's soul through a fiddle-playing contest. The song begins as a disappointed Devil arrives in Georgia, apparently \"way behind\" on stealing souls, when he comes upon a young man named Johnny who is playing a fiddle, and quite well. Out of desperation, the Devil, who claims to also be a fiddle player, wagers a fiddle of gold against Johnny's soul to see who is the better fiddler.  Although Johnny believes taking the Devil's bet might be a sin, he fearlessly accepts, confidently boasting \"I'm the best that's ever been.\"\nThe Devil plays first, backed by a band of demon musicians. When he has finished, Johnny compliments him (\"Well, you're pretty good, old son.\") and takes his own turn, rendering at least four old-time songs, named (though not played) in the Charlie Daniels Band recordingâthe third of the four being identified not by title, but by an excerpt of its lyrics:\n\n\"Fire on the Mountain,\" the name of an early 19th-century fiddle tune, and also the name of Daniels' 1974 album,\n\"The House of the Rising Sun,\" a traditional American southern folk song,\n\"Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough,\" which was famously used in Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys' song \"Ida Red,\" and\n\"Granny Will Your Dog Bite.\"Realizing he has been defeated, the devil lays his golden fiddle at Johnny's feet. Johnny then invites the devil to \"c'mon back if y'ever wanna try again\" before repeating his claim to be \"the best that's ever been\".  The resolution is not without ambiguity.  While the devil seems to have failed, Johnny's indulgence in the sin of pride indicates the devil may have won his soul after all through clever subterfuge.\n\nReception\nCash Box praised the \"engaging narrative story line\" and said the song has \"thundering piano\", \"screaming fiddle work\", \"pounding drums and screeching guitar\". Record World said that Daniels \"administers heavy doses of both [storytelling and fiddle-playing] with producer John Boylan capturing the excitement like no one else can.\"\n\nCensorship\nJohnny's final boast, from the album version of the song, goes, \"I done told you once, you son of a bitch, I'm the best that's ever been\".  But to accommodate radio airplay for Country and Top 40 formats, Daniels changed the lyric for the single release to, \"'Cause I told you once, you son of a gun\", though AOR stations continued to use the unaltered version.\n\nMusical references\nThe ballad's story is a derivative of the traditional deal with the Devil motif. Charlie Daniels has stated in interviews, \"I don't know where it came from, but it just did. Well, I think I might know where it came from, it may have come from an old poem called 'The Mountain Whippoorwill' that Stephen Vincent BenÃ©t wrote many, many years ago (1925), that I had in high school.\"\n\nPersonnel\nCharlie Daniels - guitar, fiddle, vocals\nTom Crain - guitar, vocals\n\"Taz\" DiGregorio - keyboards, vocals\nFred Edwards - drums, percussion\nJames W. Marshall - drums, percussion\nCharles Hayward - bass\n\nParodies and covers\nThe Levellers released a version of the song in 1991.\nAlthough it is frequently misattributed to David Allan Coe or \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, the musician Travis Meyer performed a parody entitled \"The Devil Went to Jamaica\" circa 1998, in which Johnny is recast as a Jamaican drug dealer who is challenged by the devil to a pot-smoking contest to see whose marijuana is best: his, or Johnny's.\nOn a 1980 The Muppet Show episode (Episode 420), the Muppet versions of the Devil and Johnny are portrayed in an opening number cover of the song.\nThe rap group K.M.C. Kru released a hip hop re-imagining of the song entitled \"The Devil Came Up to Michigan\" in 1991, featuring the devil and a deejay competing for a turntable of gold.\nIn the 2000 movie Coyote Ugly, the original song version by the Charlie Daniels Band is sung and danced to as an on-bar line dance by the troupe of female bartenders.\nSteve Ouimette (with Ed DeGenaro and Geoff Tyson) performed a cover of the song for the 2007 video game Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock and, eventually, his 2010 album Epic. This version uses electric guitars instead of fiddles, though the original lyrics are still performed. It is played as the conclusion of the game in a simulated guitar battle with the devil. Daniels objected to this version on the grounds that the devil may win the contest, which he referred to as \"violating the very essence of the song\".\nIn 2013, the Boston-based roots rockers Adam Ezra Group recorded a parody version, \"The Devil Came up to Boston\", with Boston-focused lyrics. In this version's official music video, group leader Adam Ezra, who wrote the lyrics to the parody, narrates it with an exaggerated version of his real-life Boston accent, and the Devil is depicted as a New York Yankees fan, playing off the historic rivalry between the Yankees and Boston Red Sox.\nThe pop singer and electric violinist Michelle Lambert recorded a version of the song in 2015, and released a music video. In her rendition \"Johnny\" is replaced by \"Michelle\".\nA cappella group Home Free recorded a version of the song in collaboration with Taylor Davis and Charlie Daniels playing fiddle, released in September 2015. The narration is performed by Home Free bass singer Tim Foust.\nThe rock band Blues Traveler often performs this song in concert, with John Popper playing the fiddle parts on harmonica. They featured a live version of the song on their 2006 EP Â¡Bastardos en Vivo!\nRobot Chicken featured a composite parody of the song along with the animated series Spawn in episode 49 of season 3, where Malebolgia, an infernal lord, is challenged by Spawn to a fiddle duel set to a similar tune.\nIn the Futurama episode \"Hell is Other Robots\", Leela must challenge the robot devil in a fiddle-playing contest to win back Bender's soul. Also included as a prize for the winner of the contest is a solid gold fiddle.\nThe funk metal band Primus covered the song and featured it, in the form of a stop motion animated music video, on a CD-ROM that was included with the 1998 release of their EP Rhinoplasty.\nBritish Punk band The Toy Dolls recorded a version called 'The Devil Went Down to Scunthorpe', which used a guitar duel instead of a fiddle duel between Johnny and the Devil.\nThe Christian parody band ApologetiX recorded a parody called \"The Devil Went Down to Jordan\" which records the Devil's attempt to tempt Jesus in the wilderness.\nBritish comedy folk band The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican recorded a version called 'The Devil Went Down To Barnsley', in which the devil has a fiddle duel with Bjorn Doonicansson.\nThe American metal band Nature of Rebel Minds  released a cover of the song in 2019 and released an official music video to youtube as well. \nThe American nu metal band Korn recorded a cover of the song in 2020 which featured the band playing the devil and rapper Yelawolf as Johnny.\nThe Canadian rock band Nickelback recorded a cover in 2020 with Dave Martone. This version uses electric guitars instead of fiddles, tuned down a whole step, and contains the original lyrics with slight changes.\nA metal version of the song was recorded by Leo Moracchioli for his YouTube channel, Frog Leap Studios. The video was publicly released on July 17, 2020.\nA cover of the song titled \"Devil Comes Back to Georgia\" was done by Johnny Cash singing updated lyrics with violin performed by Mark O'Connor in 1993.\nIn 1996, the indie rock band Mono Puff released their studio album Unsupervised, which spawned a single \"The Devil Went Down to Newport\".\nThe Zac Brown Band perform the song regularly in concert, and included a version on their 2009 EP Live from Bonnaroo\nAdrenaline Mob released a heavy metal cover in their 2015 album \"Dearly Departed\".\n\nChart performance\nThe original version of the song spent fourteen weeks on the Hot Country Singles charts in 1979, peaking at number 1 and holding the position for one week. It spent two weeks at a peak of number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100.  The single was certified Platinum by the RIAA on December 20, 1989, for sales of over two million copies in the United States. In 2003, the song was ranked at #69 on CMT's 100 Greatest Songs of Country Music, and #5 on CMT's 20 Greatest Southern Rock Songs in 2006. Since it became available as a download in the digital era, it has also sold 2.49 million digital copies in the US as of November 2019. In June 1998, Epic Records re-released the song to country radio, but accidentally sent out the version in which the line \"son of a bitch\" was uncensored. This error was quickly corrected, and the song re-entered the country charts at number 62 for the chart dated June 20, 1998. It spent seven weeks on the chart and peaked at number 60.\n\nCertifications\nSequel\nIn 1993, a sequel to the song, \"The Devil Comes Back to Georgia\", was released by master violinist Mark O'Connor on his album Heroes. The song featured Daniels on fiddle, with Johnny Cash as the narrator, Marty Stuart as Johnny, and Travis Tritt as the devil. The song peaked at #54 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart in 1994.\nIn the sequel, the devil, still furious ten years after being beaten, decides to take up Johnny's challenge to \"c'mon back if y'ever wanna try again\". Johnny is now grown with a wife and infant son, and the devil believes that Johnny's sinful pride will be his undoing, so he takes back the golden fiddle, forcing Johnny to practice with his old fiddle before their rematch â the same one he played when he defeated the devil. \nThough the song reiterates Johnny's bold claim that he is \"the best that's ever been\", the lyrics do not reveal who won the rematch. But in the video, the devil is shown defeated by Johnny again.\n\nSee also\n\"Cross Road Blues\"\nFaust\n\"The Devil and Daniel Webster\"\n\"The Devil and Tom Walker\"\n\"The Devil's Dream\"\nPassage 3:\nThe Littlest Hobo\nThe Littlest Hobo is a Canadian television series (French title: Le Vagabond) based upon a 1958 well-known film of the same name directed by Charles R. Rondeau. The series first aired from 1963 to 1965 in syndication, and was revived for a popular second run on CTV, spanning six seasons, from October 11, 1979, to March 7, 1985. The concept of the show was that of \"an ownerless dog\".\nAll three productions revolved around an extremely intelligent stray German Shepherd, the titular Hobo, who wanders from town to town, helping people in need (all portrayed by actors in celebrity guest appearance roles). Despite the attempts of the many people whom he helped to adopt him, he heads off by himself at the end of each episode.\nReferred to as âGulliverâ in a single episode, the dog is often referred to by the name Hobo or by the names given by temporary human companions. His origins, motivation, and ultimate destination are never explained on screen.\n\n1963â1965 series\nThe German Shepherd dogs featured in both 1960s and 1980s series were owned and trained by Charles (Chuck) P. Eisenmann. The primary star was named London, but several of London's relatives, including Toro, Litlon, and Thorn, also played scenes as the Hobo. Eisenmann used his own training methods to work with his dogs which involved educating them to think and understand very specific directions, to recognize colours, and to understand English, German, and French. He promoted his education method by touring with his dogs to offer live demonstrations,  appearing on TV and radio shows and by writing books. Eisenmann recounts many stories from the filming of the series in his 1968 dog training book Stop! Sit! and Think. Other books he wrote include The Better Dog: The Educated Dog which contains updated training material and A Dogâs Day in Court which offers a dog's point of view towards training methods.\nThe dogs have \"reverse mask\" markings. After purchasing London, Eisenmann began to breed his own dogs, mostly studding out his males, even though he owned some females that he bred to as well. He bred particularly for the reverse mask, that is commonly seen on all of his dogs, and is unpopular with breeders of the German Shepherd, as it is not in the breed standard.\nShiloh Shepherd dogs are stated to trace their heritage back to London's relatives and are inspired by the intelligence Eisenmann's dogs were reputed to have.Some notable Hollywood guest stars included Pat Harrington Jr., Nita Talbot, Ellen Corby, Henry Gibson, and Keenan Wynn (the last two of which would also guest-star in the 1979â1985 revival series).\n\n1979â1985 series\nIn 1979 CTV revived the series. The New Littlest Hobo (as it was sometimes called), which ran for six seasons, was shot on videotape rather than film. It has since been syndicated in many countries including the US and UK. In the course of its run, a mixture of well-known Canadian and Hollywood guest stars appeared such as Al Waxman, Carol Lynley, John Ireland, Megan Follows, Rex Hagon, Alan Hale Jr., Jack Gilford, August Schellenberg, DeForest Kelley, Ray Walston, Morey Amsterdam, Jeff Wincott, Michael Ironside, Patrick Macnee, Abe Vigoda, Saul Rubinek, John Vernon, Keenan Wynn (who also previously appeared in the original 1963â1965 series), Chris Makepeace, Karen Kain, Vic Morrow, Andrew Prine, Lynda Day George, Nerene Virgin, Tedde Moore, Sammy Snyders, Henry Gibson (who also previously appeared in the original 1963â1965 series), John Carradine, Leslie Nielsen, Anne Francis, and Jayne Eastwood. Mike Myers appears as Tommy in episode 10 \"Boy on Wheels\".\nCharles (Chuck) P. Eisenmann appeared as a dog trainer named Chuck in the first-season episode \"Stand In\" and as dog kennel operator named Mr. Charles in part one of the episode \"Voyageurs\" from the sixth season.\nIn a nod to the original series, the dog that appeared in this series was also credited as \"London\".\n\nPlot\nPlots ranged from the simple \"dog-helps-person\" stories to secret agent-type adventures.\nIn season 5's two-part episode \"The Genesis Tapes\" a scientist and a reporter theorized that Hobo was a type of superior canine. The reporter theorized that there was one dog and the scientist theorized that there were up to one hundred such dogs. The two-part episode had the scientist and reporter trying to capture Hobo to study him, with the reporter wanting a story and the scientist wanting to claim to be the first to discover the meta-canine as he put it. Both episodes feature flashback footage from the first five seasons of the series, with the first episode being the only episode of the revival series to include footage from the original 1960s series. At the end of the episode, Hobo found the evidence the reporter and scientist had collected and destroyed it, implying that Hobo did not want any evidence of his origins or nature becoming public.\nTrainer Chuck Eisenmann used several dogs to play the role of \"London\" as he had selected dogs entirely based on their appearance. He determined which dogs to use for the scenes by making use of their abilities such as if one dog did not mind carrying objects or if one were small enough to safely jump through a car window and manoeuvre through the seats. In Eisenmann's book, A Dog's Day in Court, one of the dogs used in the 1970s series was London's grandson, who was also known as London.\nA 2005 episode of the CTV sitcom Corner Gas, entitled \"The Littlest Yarbo\", pays tribute to the series by having a character (Hank Yarbo) convinced that a stray dog visiting the town is Hobo. The episode ends with a reprise of Terry Bush's \"Maybe Tomorrow\" theme song.\n\nTheme music\nThe show's theme, \"Maybe Tomorrow\", was written by Terry Bush and John Crossen.  The original was sung by Terry Bush. In 2005, Bush commercially released the song on his debut album, entitled Maybe Tomorrow. The song was later used in a 2011 Dulux paint advertisement.  Additionally, in 2017, the song was in a Canada 150-themed Co-Op stores advertisement. A cover of the song, performed by Nightingale Cummings, was featured in season ten of the television show Trailer Park Boys.\n\nSecond series episodes\nTelecast and home media\n1963â1965 series\nFollowing the 1958 film, the 1960s original TV series was aired in syndication around the world, including the UK on ITV, Australia on the Nine Network between 1964 and 1967 and New Zealand on TV One. Although the series was originally broadcast in black and white, it was in fact produced in colour. The VCI Entertainment DVD release of the series featured the colour versions of the episodes, except for the opening and closing credits which have only survived in black and white. Sixty-one episodes were broadcast over two seasons.\nStorer Programs Incorporated, a unit of the now-defunct Storer Broadcasting, distributed the series to U.S. television stations during its 1960s run.\nVCI Entertainment has released 12 episodes from the original series to DVD. The release features the colour versions of the first 3 episodes, except for the opening and closing sequences which have only survived in monochrome. The last 9 episodes were released in black and white.\n\n1979â1985 series\nThe series aired on CTV on Thursday nights at 7:30 p.m. Repeats continued on CTV, CTV 2, and other national networks up until 2012, when CTV replaced it with a block of music videos from Juicebox. However, CTV2 recently resumed reruns of the 80's incarnation. In the UK, the series premiered on the BBC on April 8, 1982, but only the first three seasons were shown and repeated until 1989. From April 1991 ITV picked up the series and each of the local companies played out the full series until late 1994.\nMediumrare Entertainment have only released the first two seasons of The Littlest Hobo on DVD. The Season One DVD, featured the theme tune \"Maybe Tomorrow\" on DVD in Region 2 & 4 on April 26, 2010.\nIn 2017, episodes from the series began to be uploaded onto Encore+, a YouTube channel run by the Canada Media Fund and Google Canada. The episodes have since been removed from the channel. As of 2023, the entire series is available on CTV's website through the CTV Throwback lineup, and reruns returns on Bell Media's channels: CTV, CTV 2, and Animal Planet.\nPassage 4:\nSame Old Lang Syne\n\"Same Old Lang Syne\" is a song written and recorded by Dan Fogelberg and released as a single in 1980. It was included on his 1981 album The Innocent Age. The song is an autobiographical narrative ballad told in the first person and tells the story of two long-ago romantic interests meeting by chance in a grocery store on Christmas Eve.  The song peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 and is now frequently played during the holiday season and alongside traditional Christmas songs.\n\nContent\nOn a snowy Christmas Eve, the narrator is reunited with an old flame at a grocery store. She does not recognize him at first, but when she does, she so hurriedly embraces him that she drops her purse, breaking the tension and letting them laugh. They decide to talk over a drink but there are no bars open, so they bring a six-pack of beer from a liquor store to her car.The pair toast innocence, and push through their initial awkwardness to discuss their lives. The lover married an architect, for security instead of love. The narrator, a musician, loves performing for audiences, but hates traveling.After consuming all of the beer, they exchange their goodbyes; the woman kisses him as he gets out of the car, and drives away. He flashes back to school and relives the pain of their breakup; as he walks home, the falling snow turns into rain.\nThe melody is based on the 1812 Overture by Tchaikovsky and ends with \"Auld Lang Syne\" as a soprano saxophone solo by Michael Brecker.\n\nOrigins\nAs Fogelberg said on his official website, the song was autobiographical. He was visiting his parents for Christmas at the family home in Peoria, Illinois, in 1975 when he ran into an old girlfriend from Woodruff High School, the former Jill Anderson at the \"Convenient Food Mart\" (now a convenience store) on Abington Street Hill. Fogelberg stated in interviews that he did not recall precisely whether the chance meeting with his ex-girlfriend was in 1975 or 1976, though he leaned toward 1975; this was later confirmed. \nIn 2006, Fogelberg received a letter from a young fan named Grace Ferguson who asked him about the meaning of the song's final lyric, \"And as I turned to make my way back home / The snow turned into rain\". The lyric has often been interpreted metaphorically as the world feeling warmer after he had talked with his ex-girlfriend. In reply, Fogelberg acknowledged this metaphor as \"wonderful\", although, as he wrote, \"as I drove home, the snow actually DID turn from snow into rain!\".After Fogelberg's death from prostate cancer in 2007, the woman in the song, Jill Anderson Greulich, came forward with her story. Greulich told of how she and Fogelberg dated in high school. As she explained to the Peoria Journal Star in an article dated December 22, 2007, the pair knew each other in Peoria, Illinois as part of the Woodruff High School class of 1969. After graduation, each attended different colleges. Following college, Greulich married and moved to Chicago, while Fogelberg moved to Colorado to pursue a music career. While back in Peoria visiting their respective families for Christmas in 1975, Fogelberg and Greulich ran into each other on Christmas Eve at a convenience store located at 1302 East Frye Avenue in the Abington Hill district. Greulich confirmed that they bought a six-pack of beer and drank it in her car for two hours while they talked. Five years later, after the song was released, Greulich heard the song on the radio for the first time while driving to work, but kept quiet about it, as Fogelberg had not disclosed her identity. She stated that her reason for remaining quiet about her involvement in the song's narrative was that coming forward might have disrupted Fogelberg's marriage.Greulich noted that Fogelberg had taken artistic license with two details of the story: her eyes are green, not blue, and her husband was a physical education teacher, not an architect. In regard to the line, \"She would have liked to say she loved the man, but she didn't like to lie,\" Greulich will not talk about it, but by the time of the song's release in 1980, she and her husband had divorced.\nIn 2008, the City of Peoria gave Abington Street Hill the honorary designation of \"Fogelberg Parkway\".\n\nAssociation with Christmas\n\"Same Old Lang Syne\" is frequently played on radio stations during the North American holiday season. The song's opening lyrics reveal that the narrative takes place on a snowy Christmas Eve and they end with a second acknowledgment of snow. Since the song's release, these references and the musical quote of \"Auld Lang Syne\", a song traditionally sung on New Year's Eve, have increased the song's popularity during the month of December. The song debuted on the Hot 100's top 40, at #37, on 27 December 1980, between Christmas and New Year's Eve.\n\nCover versions\nThe boy band Backstreet Boys covered the song on their album A Very Backstreet Christmas, released on October 14, 2022. Their version omits the final verse and instead ends with the chorus to \"Auld Lang Syne\".\n\nMusicians\nDan Fogelberg: Piano, bass, electric piano, lead and background vocals\nGlen Spreen: orchestral arrangements\nRuss Kunkel: Drums\nMichael Brecker: Soprano saxophone\n\nChart performance\nPassage 5:\nLove Is a Drug (Eskimo Joe song)\n\"Love Is a Drug\" is a song by Australian rock band Eskimo Joe.

Lead singer Zac Brown co-wrote the song with Coy Bowles (the band's keyboardist and guitarist), Wyatt Durrette and Levi Lowrey. It is the band's seventh single release overall, and the second single from their 2010 album You Get What You Give.\n\nContent\nThe lyric is about a trucker who is on the road, and separated from his lover due to the weather. Co-writer Wyatt Durrette told The Boot:\n\nThere was a girl I was seeing, who lived in Kansas City. We really liked each other, but geography and timing just wasn't working for us. She was getting pretty frustrated with the whole thing and wanted me to slow down, as far as traveling so much and all those things. I wasn't willing to do that because we were just getting started, and I'm chasing my dreams.\n\"Colder Weather\" is in the key of E-flat major, with the guitars set to Eâ­ tuning. In this song, Brown's vocals range from Bâ­2 to Aâ­4.\n\nCritical reception\nThe song has received primarily positive reviews from critics. Jessica Phillips of Country Weekly, in her review of the album, called it \"lyrically profound,\" and Eric R. Danton of the Hartford Courant said that it was the \"sorrowful, solitary kind of song with an old-school country-ballad feel made for crisp nights in the high country.\" Giving it a \"thumbs up,\" Karlie Justus of Engine 145 called it \"loneliness and longing set to music\", also praising the production and lyrics. She compared the song's style to Merle Haggard. Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine was less favorable, calling the song \"somewhat strident and inorganic.\"\n\nMusic video\nThe music video was directed by Darren Doane and premiered in February 2011. Australian actor Liam Hemsworth appeared in the video portraying the male character who temporarily leaves his girlfriend during the winter.  Tori McPetrie portrays his girlfriend.\n\nCharts and certifications\nPassage 8:\nGodsmack\nGodsmack is an American rock band from Lawrence, Massachusetts, formed in 1995. The band is composed of lead singer and rhythm guitarist Sully Erna, bassist Robbie Merrill, lead guitarist Tony Rombola and drummer Shannon Larkin. Since its formation, Godsmack has released eight studio albums, one EP (The Other Side), four DVDs, one compilation album (Good Times, Bad Times... Ten Years of Godsmack), and one live album (Live & Inspired).\nThe band has released three consecutive number-one albums (Faceless, IV and The Oracle) on the Billboard 200. The band also has 25 top ten rock radio hits, including 18 songs in the top five. The band's seventh album, When Legends Rise was released on April 27, 2018.\nSince its inception, Godsmack has toured with Ozzfest on more than one occasion and has toured with many other large tours and festivals, including supporting its albums with its own arena tours. In honor of the band's success and the release of their sixth studio album, 1000hp, Mayor Marty Walsh declared August 6 as \"Godsmack Day\" in the city of Boston.\n\nHistory\nFormation and All Wound Up... (1995â1997)\nIn February 1995, Sully Erna decided to start a new band as the lead singer after playing the drums for more than 23 years, including more than two years in the now-defunct band Strip Mind. His new band, The Scam, formed with Erna on vocals, Robbie Merrill on bass, local guitarist and friend Lee Richards on guitar, and Tommy Stewart on drums. The Scam quickly changed its name to Godsmack, after recording one demo. The newly formed band started playing small bars in their hometown of Boston. Locally popular songs such as \"Keep Away\" and \"Whatever\" soon brought them to the top of the hit charts in the Boston/New England area.Many people think the band's name stemmed from an Alice in Chains song, but according to Erna, the band's name came from a small and personal incident. \"I was making fun of [our drummer at the time] who had a cold sore on his lip and the next day I had one myself and somebody said, 'It's a god smack.' The name stuck. We were aware of the Alice In Chains song but didn't really think much about it.\" In 1996, Tony Rombola joined as the guitarist after Richards left upon learning he had a six-year-old child and Stewart left due to personal differences. In the same year, the band entered New Alliance Studio in Boston to record its debut album, All Wound Up.... The CD was recorded in just three days for $2,600 and was self-released in February 1997 through the band's own record label, E. K. Records Company. In May 1997, Joe D'Arco joined to replace Stewart on drums.Eventually, Godsmack's CD landed in the hands of Rocko, the night-time DJ for Boston radio station WAAF (FM). The radio station put \"Keep Away\" into heavy rotation and the song rose to the number one spot at the station very quickly. Newbury Comics, a New England record store chain, agreed to sell the CD on consignment. Shortly after the success of \"Keep Away\", Godsmack went back into the studio and recorded a single titled \"Whatever\", which became the new local favorite on WAAF (FM). In an interview Sully Erna stated, \"We had been selling maybe 50 copies a month at the time WAAF picked up the album. All of a sudden we started moving over a thousand records a week. (...) I was doing all this from my bedroom. After years of grinding away, things finally started taking off.\" In April 1998, D'Arco was dismissed from the band. He was replaced by former drummer Tommy Stewart, who returned after expressing a desire to be in the band again.\n\nGodsmack (1998â1999)\nIn June 1998, Universal/Republic Records signed the band to their label.  The band's first album All Wound Up... was slightly edited to remove unlicensed samples, fully re-mastered and given a new artwork and layout; the finished self-titled album Godsmack was released to the public six weeks later on August 25, 1998. This led to the band's first headlining tour, \"The Godsmack Tour\" with Jim Rose Circus as the opening act. After the album's release the band went on the road playing club shows as well as playing at Ozzfest and Woodstock '99. This was followed by a tour in Europe supporting Black Sabbath. Roxanne Blanford from Allmusic gave the album three out of five stars, stating, \"Godsmack confidently brought metal into the technological age\". The album entered the Billboard 200 at number twenty-two, and was certified 4Ã platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2001 after being initially certified gold in 1999.The album sold well despite being initially pulled from the shelves in some stores due to concerns over some of its lyrical content. The band and its record label later added a Parental Advisory sticker to the album, and some stores ordered amended copies of the album. Erna commented in Rolling Stone magazine stating, \"Our record has been in the marketplace for more than a year now without a parental advisory sticker and this is the one and only complaint ... Stickers and lyrics are by nature subjective ... We have decided to put a sticker on the record.\" This controversy did not appear to adversely affect album sales but, according to Erna, helped; \"It's almost taunting kids to go out and get the record to see what we're saying on it.\" The album also had four successful singles which were \"Whatever\", \"Keep Away\", \"Voodoo\" and \"Bad Religion\".\n\nAwake (2000â2001)\nIn 2000, Godsmack returned to the studio after the multi-platinum success of Godsmack to start recording Awake. The album was released on October 31, 2000. The album debuted at number five on the Billboard 200, and has been certified 2Ã platinum by the RIAA. \"Vampires\", a song on the album, also earned the band a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2002. With the release of Awake, Godsmack toured Europe supporting Limp Bizkit. Erna said at the time, \"We've been touring nonstop since August 1998, So most of Awake was written on tour while we were ping-ponging between America and Europe, building up the band. \"Ozzfest\" was actually the only big tour where we rode under someone else's wings; we did a lot of work on our own.\" The band played Ozzfest in 2000 again as they had in 1999. On July 19, 2001, Godsmack released their first live DVD titled Live. The DVD has since been certified Gold by the RIAA for selling 50,000 copies in the United States.Two of the songs on the album were used in United States Navy commercials (\"Sick of Life\" and \"Awake\") as background music. Erna stated, \"Someone in the military is a fan, and they asked if they could use the music, and we accepted\". However, Erna insisted in an interview that Godsmack does not support any war.\n\nThe Scorpion King, Faceless and The Other Side (2002â2004)\nIn 2002, Erna was asked to write and perform a song for the soundtrack to The Scorpion King. The song Godsmack wrote and performed was titled \"I Stand Alone\" and the song became the number 1 single at Rock Radio and the most played Active Rock song in 2002 for 14 weeks straight. It was also used in the game Prince of Persia: Warrior Within.With Shannon Larkin (ex Ugly Kid Joe, Souls at Zero, Wrathchild America, MF Pitbulls) replacing Tommy Stewart, who left due to personal differences for the second time, Godsmack went back into the studio later that year to record a new album that was released in 2003. Faceless debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 269,000 copies in its first week, and the album would go on to sell over one million copies in the United States. Faceless also debuted at number nine on the Top Canadian Albums and at number one on the Top Internet Albums and remained at that position for two weeks. A massive Tour of America and Europe supporting Metallica followed.\nThe lead single \"Straight Out of Line\" received a Grammy Award nomination for \"Best Hard Rock Performance\". The award went to Evanescence's single \"Bring Me to Life\". The album got its name after a swimming-pool incident. However, in a later interview Merrill stated otherwise, making it unclear of how the album's title came to be, \"It came from the band's feeling that, despite our radio and sales success, we still flew a bit under the radar\".On March 16, 2004 The Other Side, an acoustic EP, was released. The album debuted at number five on the Billboard 200, a relatively high position for an acoustic EP. It included several previously released songs re-recorded as acoustic versions, as well as three new acoustic tracks. One new song, \"TouchÃ©\", featured Godsmack's first guitar player, Lee Richards, as well as John Kosco, who were at that time in the now defunct band Dropbox, The other two new acoustic tracks were \"Running Blind\" and \"Voices\". The song \"Asleep\" is actually an acoustic version of \"Awake\" from the band's second album Awake. Godsmack shifted from its \"heavy\" sound to a more mellow acoustic sound on this EP in the same manner Alice in Chains did in the Sap and Jar of Flies EPs, one of many similarities to Alice in Chains for which the band has been criticized.In 2004, Godsmack opened for Metallica's \"Madly in Anger with the World tour\", and headlined the tour along with Dropbox. Afterwards, in autumn 2004, the band played several acoustic shows to promote The Other Side, while at the same time continuing to open for Metallica.\n\nIV and Ten Years of Godsmack (2005â2007)\nThroughout 2005, The band was in the studio recording and writing material for a new album. On April 25, 2006, Godsmack released its fourth studio album simply titled IV, followed by a tour that would continue until August 2007, titled \"The IV tour\". The album was produced by Erna and engineered by the well known producer and engineer Andy Johns, known for engineering Led Zeppelin's Led Zeppelin IV. The first single from the album, \"Speak\" was released on February 14, 2006. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 211,000 copies in its first week.IV has since been certified gold. The band had written over forty songs for the album, but the final track listing had eleven tracks, Larkin commented, \"it's Sully's band and his vision.[...]When it comes time to pick the songs it's all Sully\". The album's minimalist name \"IV\" derives not only from its being the band's fourth studio album, but also from a running piece of backstage humor, as related by Larkin and Erna in an interview.To celebrate ten years as a band, Godsmack released a greatest hits album entitled Good Times, Bad Times... Ten Years of Godsmack on December 4, 2007. The album debuted at number thirty-five on the Billboard 200, selling 40,000 copies in the first week of release. It includes a cover of the Led Zeppelin song \"Good Times Bad Times\", as well as a DVD of Godsmack's acoustic performance in Las Vegas at House of Blues. The album was originally intended to be a boxed set, but the band scrapped the plans so they could release a best of album. Godsmack will follow the release of the album with an acoustic tour. Despite rumors of the band going on hiatus as a result of releasing a greatest hits album, Erna was quoted as saying, \"we're not going away, we are just gonna take a break and enjoy our 10th year anniversary and kind of recharge our batteries. And then Godsmack will be back, and we will come back bigger and badder than ever.\"\n\nThe Oracle and break (2008â2013)\nIn November 2008, Larkin announced that the band would be reforming and recording a new album. The following summer, the band toured as support to MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e's CrÃ¼e Fest 2 tour and released a non-album single, \"Whiskey Hangover\". After the tour, Godsmack started production for their new album. The album, titled The Oracle was released on May 4, 2010. Arriving to popular reception, The Oracle was Godsmack's third straight full-length studio album to debut at No. 1 with 117,000 sold in the first week of release. Erna had this to say about the early sound album, \"It's gonna be really heavy. I mean, it's very aggressive. I'm not really sure; it's very premature right now. Right now we just finished one track for the CrÃ¼e Fest this Summer. But as far as the whole record goes, I think it's going to be a lot more in your face. I don't think there's going to be any 'Voodoo's or 'Serenity's on this one. We decided to go balls out!\".Godsmack headlined the fourth annual Mayhem Festival alongside Disturbed. The band entered the studio in January 2012 to mix a live album plus record several covers for an upcoming release. They then went on tour in the spring with Staind. In February 2012, Godsmack finished an EP of cover songs. Godsmack released their new live album Live & Inspired on May 15, 2012. The set included a bonus EP of cover tracks. In December of the same year, Sully said in an interview that Godsmack would take a break during 2013, stating \"We're going to take some time away now because we just ran for the last two years.\" A month after, Erna announced a short solo tour through America.\n\n1000hp (2014â2016)\nIn February 2014, Erna tweeted that the band had made progress in the songwriting process for its next studio album, tentatively scheduled for a late 2014 release. He also mentioned that the band finished 11 songs for the new record in two weeks. In April, the band announced that they had recorded 15 songs, ten of which would make the final cut. In May, Erna announced that the album would be titled 1000hp (1000 Horsepower). The album's title track was released as a single the following month. The album was released on August 5, 2014, and sold around 58,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release to land at position No. 3 on The Billboard 200 chart. Since release the album has spawned the singles Something Different and What's Next. The band have unified a campaign to aid military veterans with their latest single What's Next.Godsmack also headlined the 2014 Uproar Festival. They were announced on August 20, 2014, to be part of the Soundwave Festival in Australia. In July 2015, the band revealed dates for an upcoming North American fall headline tour. The run included dates with Sevendust. Also in August 2015 Godsmack announced a new leg of North American dates that would keep the band busy through mid-November.On October 14, 2015, Godsmack released a digital single called \"Inside Yourself\" available for a limited free download. The song was released on iTunes on November 20, 2015.On September 9, 2016, Erna confirmed that the band had officially left Universal/Republic, and signed a deal with BMG.\n\nWhen Legends Rise (2017â2020)\nThe band began work on a seventh studio album in 2017. The album, When Legends Rise, was released on April 27, 2018. The album's first single, \"Bulletproof\", was released ahead of the album on February 28, 2018. The band toured across North America from May through October 2018. They played at several festivals before embarking on a co-headlining summer tour with Shinedown. The band then toured Europe in October and November 2018 in support of their new album. However, On October 17, 2018, it was announced that the band postponed their fall 2018 Europe tour, following death of Tony Rombola's son and plan to reschedule in early 2019.On July 25, 2019, the song \"Under Your Scars\" hit number 1 for two weeks for the first time on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart.On April 8, 2020, the band released a music video for the song \"Unforgettable\". 400 aspiring musicians from middle school students across New England to take part in the video. The video, directed by Noah Berlow, again sent the song to the top of the charts for five weeks, setting a new record most constitutive at number 1 in its category.\n\nLighting Up the Sky (2021âpresent)\nNews of a follow-up to the album began circulating as early as August 2019 when frontman Sully Erna revealed in an interview with Canada's iHeartRadio that the band has been preparing to begin the songwriting process for the album.It was later revealed that Godsmack would be working on two new releases for 2021: an acoustic EP and a full length album. That plan has since been scrapped with Sully admitting that the band was being \"a little bit more ambitious\" at the time.With just one album to focus on, Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin said on \"The Metal Teddy Bear Experience\" podcast that the band intended for the album to be released in 2022. In an April 23, 2022, interview with WJRR, frontman Sully Erna said that the band has finished recording the new album with a new single expected to hit the airwaves in mid-to-late summer and that the album could be the band's last.On September 28, 2022, the band released the single titled \"Surrender\". Shortly after the release of the new single, Sully Erna revealed in an interview with 93X Radio's Pablo that the title of the album would be Lighting Up the Sky and that it would indeed be the band's last record. A second single for the album \"You and I\" was released on November 11, 2022. The album was released on February 24, 2023.\n\nMusical style and influences\nGodsmack has been described as post-grunge, hard rock, nu metal, alternative metal, and heavy metal. The band's primary influences include Aerosmith, Alice in Chains, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Metallica, Pantera and Rush according to Erna, Larkin, and Rombola. Erna has cited Layne Staley as his primary influence.The overall sound of the band's first two albums have been compared to Alice in Chains' album Dirt. However, Godsmack has attempted to distance themselves from the Alice in Chains comparison with Erna stating in an interview with Matt Ashare, \"I've just never really heard that in our music.\"The band's music is often compared to Alice in Chains which the band cites as an influence. Adrien Begrand of PopMatters states, \"Erna perfectly mimics the late Layne Staley's low, guttural, sinister singing and snarly, metal-inspired growls\" and, \"The band's music is a faithful retread of Jerry Cantrell's churning, tuned-down hard rock\".Erna's singing style has been stated as \"the snarl of James Hetfield\", and \"composed of dark harmony that sounds a lot like Alice in Chains\". Merrill's bass style has been described as \"bulldozer bottom with occasional slap-bass reverb\". Larkin's drumming is thought to \"worship at the twin altars of Neil Peart and John Bonham\". And Rombola's guitar playing style has been praised as \"guitars that sound like percussion instruments\".\n\nBand members\nCurrent members\n\nSully Erna â lead vocals, rhythm guitar, percussion (1995âpresent); studio drums (1996â2003)\nRobbie Merrill â bass (1995âpresent); backing vocals  (2010âpresent)\nTony Rombola â lead guitar, backing vocals (1996âpresent)\nShannon Larkin â drums, percussion (2002âpresent)Former members\n\nLee Richards â lead guitar (1995â1996)\nJoe D'Arco â drums (1997â1998)\nTommy Stewart â drums (1995â1997, 1998â2002)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nTimeline\n\nDiscography\nStudio albumsGodsmack (1998)\nAwake (2000)\nFaceless (2003)\nIV (2006)\nThe Oracle (2010)\n1000hp (2014)\nWhen Legends Rise (2018)\nLighting Up the Sky (2023)\n\nAwards and nominations\nGrammy Awards\nBillboard Awards\nBoston Music Awards\nSee also\nList of artists who reached number one on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart\nPassage 9:\nGo Tell It on the Mountain (song)\n\"Go Tell It on the Mountain\" is an African-American spiritual song which was likely derived from the oral tradition, but was originally published by John Wesley Work Jr., although there is some debate whether he was actually the first to write it. This spiritual  has been sung and recorded by many gospel and secular performers since considered a Christmas carol as its original lyrics celebrate the Nativity of Jesus:\n\nGo tell it on the mountain, over the hills and everywhere;go tell it on the mountain, that Jesus Christ is born.\nAn alternate final line omits the reference to the birth of Christ, instead declaring that \"Jesus Christ is Lord\".Due to the oral tradition of the song, \"Go Tell It on the Mountain\" has also been used as a Easter song, with the refrain taking the variant of:\n\nGo, tell it on the mountain,\nOver the hills and everywhere;\nGo, tell it on the mountain \n\nThat Jesus lives again\n\nPublication history\nThe earliest known publication of the song is attributed to John Wesley Work, Jr. (1871-1925) who published the song in the New Jubilee Songs as Sung by the Fisk Jubilee Singers (1901). Work grew up in Nashville where he garnered a love for music from his father who was a choir director.  He earned his Masterâs in Latin and went on to teach ancient Latin and Greek. However, his first love continued to be music, and he became the first African-American collector of Negro spirituals. Most African-American spirituals originated in oral tradition, but Work, through his extensive research, was able to compile many songs into the âNew Jubilee Songsâ. It was not until the second version he published that âGo Tell it On the Mountainâ was included.   While many books and websites attribute the New Jubilee Songs as Sung by the Fisk Jubilee Singers to John Wesley Work, Jr. in 1901, some sources argue the origins lie with Frederick Jerome Work in 1902.\n\nBiblical references\n\"Go Tell It on the Mountain\" references the Annunciation to the Shepherds described in the Gospel of Luke, hence the alternate title of \"While shepherds kept their watching\". The Nativity is also referenced in the final verse of the song:\n\nDown in a lowly manger, \nthe humble Christ was born,\nand God sent us salvation,\nthat blessed Christmas morn.\n\nVerses: Luke 2:8-20 and Matthew 28:19\n\nRecording artists\nIn 1963, the musical team Peter, Paul and Mary, along with their musical director Milt Okun, adapted and rewrote \"Go Tell It on the Mountain\" as \"Tell It on the Mountain\", their lyrics referring specifically to Exodus and using the phrase \"Let my people go\", but referring implicitly to the civil rights struggle of the early 1960s. This version became a moderately successful single for them (US No. 33 pop, 1964).  Cash Box described it as \"a rhythmic, updating of the folk oldie with a plaintive message-song motif.\"According to religious studies professor and civil rights historian Charles Marsh, it was African-American civil rights leader Fannie Lou Hamer who combined this song with the spiritual \"Go Down Moses\", taking the last line of the chorus, \"let my people go\" and substituting it in the chorus of \"Go Tell It on the Mountain\". Marsh does not document this claim, but notes that Hamer was highly active in civil rights work beginning in the 1950s, and that the use of the Exodus story and the singing of spirituals played a central role in her activities.\nLittle Big Town's 2006 non-album single version reached No. 35 on the Hot Country Songs chart.Popular African- American Contemporary Christian music band Maverick City Music recorded and published their own version of âGo Tell it On the Mountainâ in 2021.\n\nSee also\nList of Christmas carols\nPassage 10:\nJe veux donner ma voix\nFor the Eurovision Song Contest 1999, held in Jerusalem, France entered \"Je veux donner ma voix\" to compete, performed by Nayah. Television channel France 2 was originally in charge of the French participation; however, it was later changed to France 3 due to the broadcast of the French Rugby League Championship which conflicted with the date for the final. France 3 opted to choose their entry via public selection, marking the first time since 1987 France held a national final to select their entry.\n\nBefore Eurovision\nEurovision 1999: la sÃ©lection\nEurovision 1999: la sÃ©lection was the national final organised by France 3 to select France's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 1999. The competition took place on 2 March 1999 at the L'Olympia in Paris and hosted by Julien Lepers and Karen Cheryl. The show was broadcast on France 3.\n\nCompeting entries\nFrom 600 submissions originally received by France 2, a two-member selection committee reviewed the received submissions and selected twelve entries to compete in the national final. The selection committee consisted of Monique Le Marcis (former RTL Head of Musical Programming) and Catherine RÃ©gnier (M6 music programmer).\n\nFinal\nThe final took place on 2 March 1999. Twelve entries competed and the winner, \"Je veux donner ma voix\" performed by Nayah, was selected by the combination of public televoting (50%) and a jury panel (50%). The jury panel consisted of Gilbert BÃ©caud, Marie Myriam, Jocelyne BÃ©roard, LÃ¢Ã¢m, Sandy Valentino, Richard Cocciante, Jean-Pierre Bouryayre, Laurent Petitguillaume, Jean-Michel Boris and Jean RÃ©veillon, with each member assigning scores to each entry ranging from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). The rankings of each half were used to calculate the result; hence, the song with the lowest total won. There was a tie for first place between Ginie Line and Nayah; however, Nayah won as she received the most votes from the public.\n\nAt Eurovision\nNayah performed 10th in the running order of the contest, following Denmark and preceding the Netherlands. At the close of the voting she received 14 points, placing 19th of 23.The contest was broadcast live on France 3, and on a 3 hour and 5 minute delay on TV5Monde, with commentary provided by Julien Lepers. The France 3 broadcast reached 4.2 million viewers within France, representing a 27.9% market share.\n\nVoting\nPassage 11:\nThe Story (song)\nStory or stories may refer to:\n\nCommon uses\nStory, a narrative (an account of imaginary or real people and events)\nShort story, a piece of prose fiction that typically can be read in one sitting\nStory (American English), or storey (British English), a floor or level of a building\nNews story, an event or topic reported by a news organization\n\nSocial media\nStory (social media), a message, image or video, often ephemeral\nFacebook Stories, short user-generated photo or video collections that can be uploaded to the user's Facebook\nInstagram Stories, a feature in Instagram that let the user post vertical images that will disappear in 24 hours\nSnapchat Stories, a feature in Snapchat which allows users to compile snaps into chronological storylines, accessible to all of their friends\n\nFilm, television and radio\nStory Television, an American digital broadcast television network\nStory TV, a South Korean television drama production company\nStory (TV programme), a 2015â2016 New Zealand television programme\nStory, one of the main characters in the 2006 film Lady in the Water\nThe Story (film documentary short), a 2000 short film by John Little\nThe Story with Dick Gordon, a radio interview program that debuted in 2006\n\"Stories\", an episode of The Good Doctor\n\nMusic\nGroups\nThe Story (American band), a 1989â1994 folk-rock duo\nThe Story (British band), an English psychedelic folk duo formed in 2002\nStories (band), a 1972â1974 American rock group\n\nAlbums\nStory (Amorphis album), 2000\nStory (Eric Clapton album), 1991\nStory: 25 Years of Hits, by Pet Shop Boys, 2009\nStory, by Honeybus, 1970\nStory, by NEWS, 2020\nStory, by Yesung, 2019\nA Story, by Yoko Ono (recorded 1974), or the title song, 1997\nThe Story (Brandi Carlile album) or the title song (see below), 2007\nThe Story (Kang Daniel album) or the title song, 2022\nThe Story (Runrig album) or the title song, 2016\nThe Story: The Very Best of Spandau Ballet, 2014\nThe Story, by Bizzy Bone, 2006\nStories (Addison Road album), 2010\nStories (Avicii album), 2015\nStories (The Bunny the Bear album), 2013\nStories (Gloria Gaynor album), 1980\nStories (Mayumi Iizuka album) or the title song, 2008\nStories (Milford Graves album), 2000\nStories (Randy Stonehill album), 1993\nStories (EP), by Chris Brokaw, or the title song, 2011\nStories, an EP by Aurora, 2021\nStories, by John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, 2002\nStories, by various artists, released by Narada Productions\n\nSongs\n\"Story\" (Ai song), 2005\n\"Story\" (Rina Aiuchi song), 2009\n\"Story\", by Drake White from Spark, 2016\n\"Story\", by Leddra Chapman from Telling Tales, 2009\n\"Story\", by Maroon 5, a B-side of \"Makes Me Wonder\", 2007\n\"Story\", by NF from Clouds (The Mixtape), 2021\n\"Story\", by P-Square from Get Squared, 2005\n\"Story\", by Perfume from Cosmic Explorer, 2016\n\"The Story\" (Brandi Carlile song), 2007\n\"The Story\" (Conan Gray song), 2020\n\"The Story\", by 30 Seconds to Mars from A Beautiful Lie, 2005\n\"The Story\", by Derrick Morgan\n\"The Story\", by Jewel, representing Alaska in the American Song Contest, 2022\n\"The Story\", by Limp Bizkit from The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1), 2005\n\"The Story\", by M.I.A. from AIM, 2016\n\"The Story\", by the Passions from Sanctuary, 2019 reissue\n\"Stories\" (Boney M. song), 1990\n\"Stories\" (Therapy? song), 1995\n\"Stories\", by Paige O'Hara from Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas, 1997\n\"Stories\", by Saint Motel from Voyeur, 2012\n\"Stories\", by Trapt from Trapt, 2002\n\nEPs\nStories, an EP by The Beast\n\nPlaces\nAustralia\nStory Bridge, Brisbane, Queensland\n\nUnited States\nStory, Arkansas, an unincorporated community\nStory, Indiana, an unincorporated community\nStory, Nebraska, an unincorporated community\nStory, Wyoming, a census-designated place\nJoint Expeditionary Base Fort Story, an army base in Virginia Beach, Virginia\nStory City, Iowa\nStory County, Iowa\n\nPeople\nStory (surname)\nStory Musgrave (born 1935), American doctor and astronaut\nStory Tweedie-Yates (born 1983), professional American tennis player\n\nOther uses\nStory (magazine), an American literary magazine published 1931â1961 and 1989â2000\nStory: Substance, Structure, Style and the Principles of Screenwriting, a 1997 screenwriting guide by Robert McKee\nThe Stories, by Jane Gardam, 2014\nUser story, a planning activity in software development\nRay-Ban Stories, smartglasses released in September 2021\n\nSee also\nHistory (disambiguation)\nStorey (disambiguation)\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

The ensemble cast includes Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, Michael Chiklis, Frances Conroy, Denis O'Hare, Emma Roberts, Finn Wittrock, Angela Bassett, Kathy Bates, and Jessica Lange, with all returning from previous seasons, except newcomers Chiklis and Wittrock. The season marks the first not to be strictly anthological, with Lily Rabe, Naomi Grossman, and John Cromwell reprising their roles from the series' second cycle, Asylum.\nCreated by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk for cable network FX, the series is produced by 20th Century Fox Television. Freak Show was broadcast between October 8, 2014, to January 21, 2015, consisting of 13 episodes. Like its predecessors, the season was met with positive reviews and consistently strong ratings. The premiere episode attracted a series high of 6.13 million viewers, making it the most viewed episode of the series.

Series co-creator Ryan Murphy hinted that clues about the fourth season would be hidden in the final episodes of the third season. In March 2014, the season was revealed to be set at a carnival, according to co-executive producer/writer Douglas Petrie. It was also revealed that Lange would be playing a role similar to Marlene Dietrich. Murphy revealed that the season would take place in 1950, adding: \"If you look historically what happened in the year 1950, there's some more clues in that year. It's a period piece. We try and do the opposite of what we've done before. Jessica Lange has already started practicing her German accent, so I'm very excited!\" Murphy indicated that this season drew inspiration from Tod Browning's Freaks and Herk Harvey's Carnival of Souls. This season featured the largest set ever constructed for American Horror Story, with Murphy stating: \"We had to build an entire city. We built an entire huge compound, and then we had to build the interior of all those buildings on set. It's all, period. And it's all based on [production designer] Mark Worthington's immaculate research.\"\n\nCasting\nRyan Murphy confirmed that Jessica Lange would be returning for a fourth season, although said to be in a reduced capacity. She portrayed Elsa Mars, the owner of the freak show. In November 2013, Murphy said he approached Kathy Bates and Angela Bassett to return. Bassett later confirmed in an interview with Access Hollywood that she would be indeed coming back. They portrayed Ethel Darling and Desiree Dupree, respectively. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Sarah Paulson revealed she would be returning, possibly for a main role, which was later revealed to be the conjoined twins Bette and Dot Tattler. It was announced at the PaleyFest 2014 that the cast members present at the panel would all be returning for the fourth season in some capacity, including Denis O'Hare (Stanley), Emma Roberts (Maggie Esmerelda), Frances Conroy (Gloria Mott), Evan Peters (Jimmy Darling), and Gabourey Sidibe (Regina Ross). Jamie Brewer was also added to the present roster, although Murphy later indicated Brewer may not appear during the season. She was later confirmed to portray the ventriloquist dummy Marjorie after appearing in a promo for the final episodes. Additionally, Michael Chiklis was announced to play the father of Peters' character and ex-husband of Bates' character, the strongman Dell Toledo. Finn Wittrock was the last lead actor joining the cast. He portrayed the psychopathic Dandy Mott.\nIn July 2014, TVLine reported that Wes Bentley would appear in the season' two-part Halloween episode as Edward Mordrake. At the Comic-Con 2014, it was announced that John Carroll Lynch would portray one of the central antagonist during the season, Twisty the Clown. In August 2014, R&B singer Patti LaBelle joined the cast for a four-episode story arc as the mother of Sidibe's character, named Dora, the Motts' housekeeper. Also in August 2014, it was revealed that Matt Bomer would  be guest-starring in one episode as Andy, Dell's secret lover. Murphy took to his Twitter account to announce that the world's smallest woman Jyoti Amge has joined the cast as Ma Petite. Murphy had written a role specifically for Coven alum Leslie Jordan, but he did not appear on the show due to scheduling conflicts.In September 2014, it was reported that Asylum alum Naomi Grossman would return to portray Pepper, which marked the first time a character appeared in multiple seasons of the series. Lily Rabe also reprised her Asylum character Sister Mary Eunice McKee in the tenth episode, \"Orphans\". Mare Winningham made an appearance in the same episode, as Pepper's sister Rita. Neil Patrick Harris guest starred in two episodes as Chester, who takes over the freak show when Elsa leaves for Hollywood. Harris' husband, David Burtka, appeared in the season finale as Elsa's husband.\n\nFilming\nAt Paley Center for Media's 2014 PaleyFest event, Ryan Murphy announced that the season's filming would take place again in New Orleans, Louisiana, although the show's setting is in Jupiter, Florida. The premiere episode was directed by co-creator Murphy, his first effort since the pilot. Principal photography for the season began on July 15, 2014. Production on the season concluded on December 19, 2014.\n\nMarketing\nA video released in July 2014, entitled \"Fallen Angel\", was reported by many news sources to be an official Freak Show trailer. The video â which featured the American Horror Story title card â was later taken down after FX confirmed it was fan-made. Before the debut of the fan-made video, FX had not released any official trailers concerning the upcoming season. The first official teaser was released on August 20, 2014, entitled \"Admit One\".As with previous seasons, FX released a series of teaser trailers on the show's YouTube page. FX also used the marketing hashtag #WirSindAlleFreaks in the German language, and its English translation #WeAreAllFreaks.\n\nReception\nCritical response\nAmerican Horror Story: Freak Show has received mostly positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, it scored a 69 out of 100 based on 19 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 77% approval rating with an average rating of 7.29/10 based on 35 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"Though it may turn off new viewers unaccustomed to its unabashed weirdness, Freak Show still brings the thrills, thanks to its reliably stylish presentation and game cast.\"\n\nAwards and nominations\nIn its fourth season, the series was nominated for 76 awards, 21 of which were won.\n\nHome media\nSoundtrack\nThe opening theme for the 4th season of AHS is \"Carousel\" by Melanie Martinez, a song from her debut album \"Cry Baby\".\nEvery cover song performed in Freak Show was released by 20th Century Fox TV Records in online music stores following the broadcast of the episode in which it appeared, except the cover of David Bowie's \"Heroes\", performed by Jessica Lange in \"Curtain Call.\"\nPassage 2:\nAdelaide Malanotte\nAdelaide Malanotte (1785 â 31 December 1832) was an Italian operatic contralto who performed in major opera houses in Italy from 1806â1821. She is best known for creating the title role in the world premiere of Gioachino Rossini's Tancredi in 1813. After her marriage, she performed under the name Adelaide Montresor. Her son, Giovanni Battista Montresor, had a career as a tenor and impresario in the United States. From 1812 until her death 20 years later she carried on an extra-marital affair with the poet Luigi Lechi.\n\nLife and career\nBorn in Verona, Malanotte made her professional opera debut in her native city in 1806. In 1808 she was heard at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna as Ariodante in Simon Mayr's Ginevra di Scozia. In 1809 she performed the role of Enrico in the world premiere of Stefano Pavesi's Elisabetta regina d'Inghilterra at the Teatro Regio di Torino. She returned to that theatre the following year to perform the role of Itaferne in the premiere of Giuseppe Nicolini's Dario Istaspe. She also appeared at the Teatro Valle in Rome in 1810 in the premiere of Nicola Antonio Manfroce's Alzira.In 1811 Malanotte made appearances at the opera house in Ravenna and sang in Alzira again at the opera house in Monza. In 1812 she sang at La Fenice in the title role of Gaetano Rossi's Teodoro for the work's world premiere. She was also heard that year in Florence. She had a major triumph at La Fenice in 1813 when she performed the title role in the world premiere of Gioachino Rossini's Tancredi. She later performed that role in Ferrara (1814), Bologna (1814), Livorno (1816), and Naples (1818). The latter performance was attended by composer Ferdinand HÃ©rold who \"did not like the timbre of her voice but thought her style, taste and intonation perfect\".Malanotte sang in two more world premieres at La Fenice during her career: Pavesi's Le Danaidi romane (1816, Cajo Valerio) and Francesco Basili's L'ira d'Achille (1817, Achille). She retired from the stage in 1821. She died in SalÃ² in 1832 at the age of 47.\nPassage 3:\nToday Is the Day (Lincoln Brewster album)\nToday Is the Day is the fourth studio album from contemporary Christian musician Lincoln Brewster. It was released on September 23, 2008 and debuted at No. 56 on the Billboard 200. Lincoln has embedded many personal connections into the audio on this record, the foremost of which is his son's unborn heartbeat, setting the tempo in the first seconds of \"The Power of Your Name\".\n\nRelease\nThe song \"Today is the Day\" marked the first all-new studio single released by Brewster since 2002, in his album Amazed. Christianity Today's Russ Breimeier attributed this six-year hiatus in new material to Brewster's new family and to his responsibilities as Worship Arts pastor at Bayside Church nearby Sacramento, California. The song's lyrics were written by Paul Baloche, combining the themes of Bible verses Matthew 6 and Psalm 118. The second track, \"Everywhere I Go\", was written with Glenn Packiam, a member of Desperation Band.\n\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nReception\nChristianity Today's Russ Breimeier stated that \"Today Is the Day\" and \"Everywhere I Go\", the first two tracks of the album, were a \"welcome return to form, even if the first two songs aren't the strongest way to start.\" He said that \"Today Is the Day\" was neither bad nor boring, but felt it was \"on par with the average modern worship song.\" Russmeier compared the familiarity of \"Today Is the Day\" with the more experimental songs later in the eponymous album, praising Brewster's ability to experiment over his first few songs.Breimeier noted the similarities in style between Brewster's \"The Arms of My Savior\" and John Mayer's Gravity, and between \"This Love\" and Mayer's Waiting on the World to Change. He also related the \"bluesy gospel-rock\"  song \"Give Him Praise\" to Robert Randolph and the Family Band, praising it for its \"thrilling and joyful\" feel.\nPassage 4:\nHummingbird Heartbeat\n\"Hummingbird Heartbeat\" is a song recorded by American singer Katy Perry for her third studio album, Teenage Dream (2010). It was written by Perry, Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart, Stacy Barthe, and Monte Neuble. Stewart handled the production of the song, while Kuk Harrell produced Perry's vocals. \"Hummingbird Heartbeat\" was inspired by Perry's boyfriend at the time, Russell Brand.Musically, it is a 1980s-styled hard rock song that contains a mixture of elements from rock and electronica. Lyrically, the song compares the feeling of being in love to the speed of a hummingbird's heartbeat. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, many of whom labeled it as a potential single choice. Upon the release of Teenage Dream, \"Hummingbird Heartbeat\" charted on the lower regions of the South Korea Gaon International Chart, peaking at 124.\n\nBackground and composition\nIn an interview with YouTube about Teenage Dream in August 2010, Perry revealed that \"Hummingbird Heartbeat\" was one of the first songs she wrote for the album after she finished her Hello Katy Tour (2009). When speaking about the song, Perry said she first had the idea for the song while she was in her hometown of Santa Barbara, California:\n\"I was at breakfast when I saw this hummingbird, and the hummingbird was having breakfast as well..... and I don't know if you know this but hummingbirds are supposedly good luck and I was thinking 'How fast does their hearts beat?' , like 'how many beats per minute?' And using that idea for how someone makes you feel, instead of those butterflies, it makes your heart beat really, really fast.\"\"Hummingbird Heartbeat\" is a 1980s-styled hard rock song that contains a mixture of elements from rock and electronica. The song encompasses electric guitars, a piano, and synthesizers in its production. The song also features an acoustic drum kit, unlike the other songs in the album.\n\nReception\nUpon the release of the Teenage Dream album, \"Hummingbird Heartbeat\" charted on the lower regions of the South Korea Gaon International Chart, peaking at 124. Tom Thorogood from MTV gave a positive review of the song, labeling it a strong single choice and calling it a: \"nice companion to Teenage Dream, 'the story of the birds and the bees' is more grown up with proper guitars.\" Jeb Inge of The Journal called \"Hummingbird Heartbeat\" the strongest song on the album, while Michael Gallucci of Cleveland Scene declared the song an album highlight and compared it to \"Teenage Dream\", adding that they were both \"top-down bangers.\" Gary Trust from Billboard compared \"Hummingbird Heartbeat\" to the first five Teenage Dream singles, and felt that if released as a single, would help Perry become the first artist with six number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. In July 2013, Robert Copsey and Lewis Corner of Digital Spy said \"a full music video and worldwide push would have been more satisfactory\".From February 20, 2011 to January 22, 2012, Perry embarked on the California Dreams Tour, where she performed \"Hummingbird Heartbeat\". For most of its shows, the song was the second track performed. It preceded \"Waking Up in Vegas\" and followed \"Teenage Dream\".\n\nCredits and personnel\nCredits are adapted from the liner notes of Teenage Dream.\n\nCharts\nPassage 5:\nEye of the Tiger\n\"Eye of the Tiger\" is a song by American rock band Survivor. It was released as a single from their third album of the same name and was also the theme song for the 1982 film Rocky III, which was released a day before the single. The song was written by Survivor guitarist Frankie Sullivan and keyboardist Jim Peterik, and it was recorded at the request of Rocky III star, writer, and director Sylvester Stallone, after Queen denied him permission to use \"Another One Bites the Dust\", the song Stallone intended as the Rocky III theme. The version of the song that appears in the film is the demo version of the song. The film version also contained tiger growls, which did not appear on the album version. It features original Survivor singer Dave Bickler on lead vocals. The song is also the title song to the 1986 film of the same name. \"Eye of the Tiger\" is written in the key of C minor.It gained tremendous MTV and radio airplay and topped charts worldwide during 1982. In the United States, it held No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for six consecutive weeks (the band's only song to top the chart) and was the No. 2 single of 1982, behind Olivia Newton-John's \"Physical\". It spent fifteen consecutive weeks in the top ten, the second-longest run of 1982, behind \"Hurts So Good\" by John Mellencamp (which was prevented from reaching the top of the Hot 100 by \"Eye of the Tiger\"). This top ten run is tied with the aforementioned \"Another One Bites the Dust\" as well as \"Physical\" as the longest run in the top ten for a number one song during the entire 1980s decade. The band won an award for \"Best Rock Performance by Duo or Group with Vocal\" at the 25th Annual Grammy Awards. In September 1982, it also peaked at No. 1 in the United Kingdom, remaining at the top of the UK Singles Chart for four consecutive weeks. The single sold 956,000 copies in United Kingdom in 1982.It was certified platinum in August 1982 by the RIAA, signifying sales of 2 million vinyl copies. The song had sold over 4.1 million in digital downloads in the United States alone by February 2015. It was voted VH1's 63rd-greatest hard rock song.\n\nBackground\nIn an interview with Songfacts, co-writer Jim Peterik, who shared writing credit with Frankie Sullivan, explained the song's title.\n\nAt first, we wondered if calling it \"Eye of the Tiger\" was too obvious. The initial draft of the song, we started with \"It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight, rising up to the spirit of our rival, and the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night, and it all comes down to survival.\" We were going to call the song \"Survival\". In the rhyme scheme, you can tell we had set up \"rival\" to rhyme with \"survival\". At the end of the day, we said, \"Are we nuts?\" That hook is so strong, and \"rival\" doesn't have to be a perfect rhyme with the word \"tiger\". We made the right choice and went with \"Eye of the Tiger\".\n\nAccolades\nThe song was nominated for the 1982 Academy Award for Best Original Song (the only Oscar nomination for Rocky III), but it lost to \"Up Where We Belong\" from An Officer and a Gentleman.The band won an award for \"Best Rock Performance by Duo or Group with Vocal\" at the 25th Annual Grammy Awards. The song was also nominated for the 1983 Grammy Award for Song of the Year, but lost to the Willie Nelson hit \"Always on My Mind\".\n\nLawsuits\nNewt Gingrich campaign\nIn 2012, Survivor sued Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich in Illinois federal court for using \"Eye of the Tiger\" without authorization as entrance music at his political rallies going back as far as 2009. The suit was later settled out of court.\n\nMitt Romney campaign\nThe same year Sullivan also demanded that Mitt Romney, also a Republican candidate for president, should stop using \"Eye of the Tiger\" at his campaign rallies. Romney agreed to drop the song from the campaign's playlists.\n\nMike Huckabee's campaign\nFrankie Sullivan's company Rude Music filed a lawsuit in federal court in Chicago, Illinois, on November 18, 2015, against the former Governor of Arkansas and Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee's campaign organization for using \"Eye of the Tiger\" at a political rally without permission. The rally took place on September 8, 2015, when Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk, was released from jail after spending five days there for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in Kentucky. In June 2016 it was reported by CNN that Huckabee had agreed, in a confidential, out-of-court settlement with Sullivan's Rude Music, to pay $25,000 in compensation.\n\nCredits and personnel\nCredits adapted from the album Eye of the Tiger.\nDave Bickler â lead vocals\nFrankie Sullivan â lead and rhythm guitars\nJim Peterik â grand piano, electric guitar\nStephan Ellis â bass\nMarc Droubay â drums\n\nCharts\nWeekly charts\nCertifications\nSee also\nPassage 6:\nHeartbeat (Nina Sky song)\n\"Heartbeat\" is a song by American twins duo Nina Sky.

The colors, environment, and everyone dancing in their own element creates this surreal feeling of freedom. Itâs just about listening to the rhythm inside you and letting that rhythm guide you.\" On July 27 the music video was released. It features the sisters prancing through fields during a party with multi-colored smoke and dancing with many people.\n\nTrack listing\nDigital download\"Heartbeat\" - 4:20Heartbeat â The Remixes EP\"Heartbeat\" (AC Slater Remix) - 4:45\n\"Heartbeat\" (Bailey Smalls Remix) - 6:22\n\"Heartbeat\" (The Sizzaandz Remix)\nPassage 7:\nLovely to See You\nOn the Threshold of a Dream is the fourth album by The Moody Blues, released in April 1969 on the Deram label.\n\nContent\nThe album begins with a poem derived from Cogito, ergo sum and inspired by I have no mouth and I must scream accompanied by electronic sounds, and these sounds also appear at the close of the album â  Most European vinyl pressings of the album continue the sounds into the album's run-out groove, causing them to play continuously until the record player's tonearm is lifted. Tape and CD versions of the album employ a slow fade.\n\nRelease\nOn the Threshold of a Dream was released on 25 April 1969 in the UK and 30 May 1969 in the US.

Their debut single \"Move Ya Body\", released from their self-titled debut album in 2004, was a success, reaching number four on the Billboard Hot 100. Their second album, Nicole & Natalie, was released in July 2012. Their third studio album, Brightest Gold, was announced for 2016 release through Tommy Boy Entertainment.\n\nEarly lives\nThe Albino sisters were born on March 13, 1984 to a Puerto Rican family in Queens, with Natalie being the older twin. Their parents later moved to New York City and divorced when the girls were young. The sisters grew up in Astoria, Queens in the Marine Terrace area. As a result of their stepfather working as a DJ, the twins were influenced by different types of music at an early age. By the age of 7, the twins had already written their first song, titled \"Sisters\". By 10, they knew that they wanted to become singers. When they were 13, they learned how to DJ and two years later were playing concerts in many clubs.\nThe twins' parents were very supportive of their daughters' ambitions. Their stepfather provided guitar and drum lessons and took them to auditions. They even performed occasionally on some showcases.\n\nHistory\nName origin\nThe sisters wanted to devise a band name of their own, so they used the first two syllables of their names (\"Ni\" and \"Na\"), to come up with Nina. They then added Sky, which for them represented \"independent twins\".\n\n2003â2006: Nina Sky and mixtapes\nIn 2003, The Jettsonz (Elijah Wells & Lionel Bermingham) introduced the girls to Cipha Sounds, a hip hop DJ under the Star Trak label owned by The Neptunes (Pharrell and Chad Hugo). Cipha Sounds was impressed when he heard the duo sing and suggested that they use the \"Coolie Dance\" riddim. The duo then proceeded to write \"Move Ya Body\" (alongside The Jettsonz Elijah Wells & Lionel Bermingham, who also produced the record), mixing Caribbean, R&B, and pop rhythms. Eventually, a demo of the song was made. The demo fell into the hands of Eddie O'Loughlin, the president of Next Plateau Entertainment (which is a division of Universal Records). O'Loughlin signed the twins to a contract and they started working on their debut album. On March 18, 2004, they had their first concert under their current name at Club Demara.\nThe single \"Move Ya Body\" was released on April 27, 2004 and reached number four on the Billboard Hot 100, and number 22 on the Billboard Year-End chart. Urban music and rhythmic top 40 stations quickly added the song to their play lists, sending the song up the charts. By July 17, \"Move Ya Body\" had gone to the top five on both sides of the Atlantic and had also reached the top five of a world combined R&B chart based on the US, UK, Germany, France and Australia. The song had also reached the top 50 of the Australian charts. On June 22, 2004 they released their first self-titled album, featuring Jabba and Betty Wright. The album charted #44 on the US Billboard 200 and number four on the U.S. R&B chart. Another single from the album, titled \"Turnin' Me On,\" was released on November 30, 2004. It didn't have the same success as \"Move Ya Body\", but charted at #5 on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart and was a minor success in France.\nNina Sky continued to work and promote their music. They have contributed to the reggaeton movement with songs such as \"Oye Mi Canto\", and \"MÃ¡s MaÃ­z\" with artist and producer N.O.R.E. They were also a featured artist on Sean Paul's song \"Connection\" from his album The Trinity.\nOn October 25, 2005, they released their second mixtape called La ConexiÃ³n, influenced by Latin music. The album contained the single \"Ladies Night\" (released April 17, 2006 and featuring Ivy Queen), released with the songs \"Loving You\" and \"Your Time\". It also contained Kassanova's remix of their single \"Turnin' Me On.\" The album features a lot of singers: Pitbull, N.O.R.E., Notch, Richie Rivera, Mackie, and Yaga. It also included Tony Touch's hit \"Play That Song,\" featuring Nina Sky and B-Real, released one month before the mixtape's release. In August 2006, Nina Sky were first featured on the cover of the publication The FADER, in its 39th issue. In 2006, their third mixtape \"80's Babies\" was released.\n\n2007â2011: Label issues, marriages and The Other Side\nNina Sky collaborated with French singer Kenza Farah for the song \"Celle Qu'Il Te Faut\", and was released in both French and English versions.

On December 19, 2008 Nina Sky released their first Holiday album, an EP titled Christmas.\nNina Sky appeared on Major Lazer's album, Guns Don't Kill People... Lazers Do. They were in a battle with their record company Polo Grounds Records over the release of their album Starting Today.

On March 11, 2013, group released their sixth mixtape, titled Valentine's Day, hosted by Miss KL. On December 12, group released their new promotional single titled \"Overtime\" for digital download. The song was produced by Slimmy Neutron, who produced their album Nicole and Natalie, released in 2012.\nOn March 9, 2014, Natalie Albino gave birth to her son, Max. In the same month, Nicole released her first solo project, a mixtape album titled Currently Vol. 1 which contained her remixes to many popular songs by singers such as Madonna, BeyoncÃ©, R. Kelly, Mariah Carey, etc. On April 17 they announced a new single via their official Facebook site. One day later, their new song \"Stoners\", featuring Smoke DZA was out. Single had better success than the previous one, released in 2013. It reached top 10 on New Electronic Music chart. The official music video for the single was released on July 25, via their official profiles. The extended remix for the song, made by Trayze, was also released. After the music video was released, they announced more of new music and new projects (and probably their third studio album) coming in 2015. On October 22, 2014, Nina Sky featured on Lady Bee's single \"Do It All Again\" from their album What Is a Jeffree?. Music video was also released.\nAfter finishing their Euro Tour in May 2015, on June 2, their Vito Fun and Spaceplant produced electropop single titled \"Forever\" was released from their upcoming extended play Brightest Gold, set to release in September 2015. \"We wanted something that was smooth but also had a bounce,\" Nina Sky told The FADER in an email. \"Spaceplant finessed the verses with a modern '90s freestyle beat pattern and built up the hook just enough that song still has its original sweet vibe but if you drop it at the right time in a club, it will still go off!\" twins added. EP will also be produced by Vito Fun and Spaceplant. Another tracks, including \"The Brightest Gold\", \"Nancy\", \"Zero Gravity\", \"Champion Lover\" and \"Lock and Key\" will also be on EP. The sample of \"Champion Lover\" was released on Nina Sky's official Instagram account, and is reported to be released as the second single from EP. In 2016, the twins signed a recording contract with Warner Music Group's independent recording label Tommy Boy Entertainment.\n\nDiscography\nNina Sky (2004)\nThe Other Side (2010)\nNicole and Natalie (2012)\n\nSee also\nList of Puerto Ricans\nList of twins\nPassage 9:\nFischerspooner\nFischerspooner were an electroclash duo and performance troupe formed in 1998 in Chicago after meeting in school. The name is a combination of the founders' last names, Warren Fischer and Casey Spooner.\n\nCareer\nOriginally a duo formed by classically trained musician Warren Fischer and video-artist and experimental theater performer Casey Spooner for an impromptu rendition of their makeshift track \"Indian Cab Driver\" at the Astor Place Starbucks, the group grew to over 20 performers, most of whom are dancers and guest vocalists. \"We started as a performance art piece about entertainment that ultimately became legitimate entertainment,\" said Casey Spooner, when talking about the group's origins in an April 2009 interview.\n\n#1 (2001)\nTheir debut album, #1, has been released on several record labels, including International DJ Gigolo, Ministry of Sound and Capitol Records, and includes their hit singles \"Sweetness\", \"Emerge\", and a cover of Wire's \"the 15th\". In the final months of 2004, Fischerspooner opened up their FS Studios in New York City to the public for a few hours once a week, allowing people to meet the band and production team, as well as preview new video, music and dance projects that they were working on.\n\nOdyssey (2005)\nIn 2005, Odyssey, the band's second album, was released. The album featured songs that were more structured and more accurately described as electropop than electroclash. \"Odyssey was really about being on Capitol, which was this icon of classic American music, trying to embrace that clichÃ© and find a way to embody it and infiltrate it and take it apart at the same time\", says Spooner.\nThe lead single, \"Just Let Go\", featuring live drums and guitars, possessed a markedly different sound than those heard on their debut album. \"Just Let Go\" was featured on season 2, episode 15 of Nip/Tuck; \"All We Are\" was also featured on the same TV series, in season 3, episode 1. The second single, \"Never Win\", went on to become the album's biggest hit, and was well received in both clubs and radio. Furthermore, it was also featured in the 2006 Happy Madison movie Grandma's Boy. \"A Kick in the Teeth\" was rumored to be the album's third, and possibly final, single but was only pressed on 12\" that included a remix by Tiefschwarz. This was followed after a duration of silence by a 12\" remix of \"We Need a War\" with a mix by DJ Hell. Other remixes believed to have been done are of \"All We Are\" and \"Get Confused\". \"All We Are\" was featured as the credits track in the first episode of season two of Sweetbitter.\nAfter the album's release, Fischerspooner toured a new, more elaborate show in Europe, but the band found themselves without the funds to tour the show fully in North America. \"I was incredibly frustrated because I had worked two years on this huge record and I was only able to perform for three months\", recalls Spooner, who subsequently retreated to his theatrical roots, joining experimental New York performance ensemble The Wooster Group. During this period, it was unclear whether the band would record together again; and, in May 2007, the band was released from its Capitol Records recording contract.\n\nEntertainment (2009)\nEarly European gig recordings of \"The Best Revenge\" surfaced on the internet during summer 2007. \"The Best Revenge\" was released on January 14, 2008, with French label Kitsune Music. The track includes a remix package from the likes of Autokratz, Tocadisco, Alex Gopher, The Passions and Tony Senghore. Fischerspooner also released \"Danse en France\" as a single on the KitsunÃ© label.\nWarren and Casey subsequently began to work on more material for a new album while Casey was performing the role of Ophelia's brother Laertes in The Wooster Group's production of Hamlet (Fischerspooner also contributed two original songs to the production).\nReleased in North America via the band's own label FS Studios on May 4, 2009, Entertainment is their third full-length album and was produced by Jeff Saltzman (The Killers, The Black Keys, The Sounds).\nThe album's cover was listed on Pitchfork's worst album covers of 2009.\n\nSir (2018)\nThe album Sir, executive-produced and co-written by Michael Stipe of R.E.M. and Boots, was released on February 16, 2018, on Ultra. The band released the first single \"Have Fun Tonight\" on June 19, 2017. The song \"Top Brazil\", was released on January 19, 2018; along with an electro-pop music video which Billboard called, \"provocative.\" \nNPR interpreted the album as a retrospective collage of Reagan-era queer references framed in an undeniably contemporary style;\n\"Even the cheapskate metaphor passions in the lyrics, read as physical, often NSFW desires â 'raging motorcycle thoroughbred,' 'not opposed to humiliation,' 'denim on denim,' 'dorsal fins at night in Berlin,' 'Butterscotch Goddam,' 'dark pink Saturday night' â that are dated just enough to seem older and odder. Pairing these with layered synthesizer lines and drum-machines that invoke Reagan-era industrial and EBM reinforces nostalgic notions of sexual danger.\"In an interview with the album collaborators, it was said that, \"[the album] explores Spoonerâs 're-entry into the sexual playground now defined by technology, but also the muddled ways that feelings and self-image are present in that experience' while simultaneously examining the years of 'emotional and sexual turbulence' he experienced with his ex-partner.\"\n\nBreak-up\nOn October 30, 2019, the duo announced their breakup via Instagram.\n\nBand members\nWarren Fischer â composer\nCasey Spooner â songwriter, vocals\nSam Kearney â guitar\nPeanuts, aka Jeremiah Clancy â attendant to Casey, actor\nAdam Crystal - keyboards\nCindy Greene â vocals\nLizzy Yoder â vocals\nIan Pai â musical director, drums\nVanessa Walters â choreographer, dancer\nStephanie Dixon â dancer\n\nDiscography\nAlbums\nBootleg (self-titled, with PS1 Cover Artwork) (1998)\nFischerspooner (2000) â \"For Those Who Know\" release\n#1 or Best Album Ever, originally titled Best Album Ever, \"International DJ Gigolos\" release in 2001, Ministry of Sound release in 2002, Capitol Records reissue with DVD in 2003 - UK #92\nOdyssey (2005) US #172, UK #110\nEntertainment (2009)\nSir (2018)\n\nSingles\nMusic videos\n\"Emerge\" â Original version (2001)\n\"Emerge\" â Skin version (2003)\n\"The 15th\" (2003)\n\"Sweetness\" (2003)\n\"Just Let Go\" (2005)\n\"Never Win\" (2005)\n\"Never Win\" â Mirwais version (2005)\n\"All We Are\" (made for a Coca-Cola project by Rex & Tennant) (2006)\n\"Get Confused\" (2008)\n\"We Are Electric\" (2009)\n\"The Best Revenge\" (2011)\n\"Have Fun Tonight\" (2017)\n\"Togetherness\" (2017)\n\"TopBrazil\" (2017)\nPassage 10:\nRex (Live at the Fillmore)\nRex (Live at the Fillmore) is the thirteenth album by Keller Williams, recorded live on February 8, 2006 at the Fillmore Auditorium in Denver, Colorado.The collaborative show features Williams, Keith Moseley (of The String Cheese Incident) and Jeff Austin (of Yonder Mountain String Band) performing bluegrass versions of Grateful Dead songs.

Chen's oft-time comedy partner is Zhu Shimao.\n\nName\nChen Peisi is the second son of famous stage and film actor Chen Qiang. Chen Qiang's first son (Chen Peisi's brother) was born in 1951 while he was overseas in the Hungarian capital Budapest performing The White-Haired Girl, so he named his first son Chen Buda (éå¸è¾¾) after Buda, the western half of Budapest, as he loved the city during the visit.  When the second son was born three years later, he named the son Peisi after Pest, the eastern half of Budapest, as the Standard Chinese phonetic translation of Budapest is \"BÃ¹ DÃ¡ PeÃ¬ SÄ«\".  Chen Qiang's youngest child and daughter Chen Lida (éä¸½è¾¾) was also named after a part of Budapest â the Margaret Island in the Danube between Buda and Pest.\n\nBiography\nChen was born in Changchun, Jilin on 1 February 1954. In 1966, Chen studied at The High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University. In 1969, during the Cultural Revolution, he worked in Inner Mongolia Production and Construction Corps. In 1973, Chen worked in August First Film Studio as an actor. In 1991, Chen set up a company named Hainan Comedy Film and Television Limited Company (æµ·ååå§å½±è§æéå¬å¸), then renamed it Dadao Film and Television Limited Company (å¤§éå½±ä¸æéå¬å¸). In 2000, Chen and his partner Zhu Shimao sued the China International Television Corporation over royalties from broadcasts which they won, but they were then taken off air by the parent company, China Central Television.On October 26, 2020, he returned to the CCTV stage and served as the first instructor of the variety show \"Gold Medal Comedy Class\" after 20 years.\n\nFilmography\nFilm\nTelevision\nVariety show\nPassage 12:\nSong Beneath the Song\n\"Song Beneath the Song\", also known as Grey's Anatomy: The Music Event, is the eighteenth episode of the seventh season of the American television medical drama Grey's Anatomy, and the 144th episode overall. It was named after a song initially performed by American singer Maria Taylor. Written by series creator Shonda Rhimes and directed by Tony Phelan, it premiered on ABC in the United States on March 31, 2011. It is the series's first musical episode, and features the cast performing songs previously featured within the program. It is accompanied by a soundtrack album, titled Grey's Anatomy: The Music Event, also released on March 31, 2011.\nThe episode revolves around Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) and Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), just after they are involved in a vehicular collision. Various songs are performed by the cast members, as they attempt to save the life of Torres. Rhimes originally idealized the episode at the conception of the drama, while the show remained untitled. The episode opened to polarized reviews from television critics, and it was the second most-watched program of the night. \"Song Beneath the Song\" was ranked in several \"best and worst\" lists, and the soundtrack also charted on the Billboard 200.\n\nPlot\nEn route to a weekend getaway, surgeons Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) and Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) are involved in a vehicular collision, moments after Robbins proposes marriage. Torres suffers severe injuries, which endanger both her life and the life of her unborn child. She and Robbins are taken to Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, the institute at which they both work. Their colleagues attempt to save Torres, while Robbins and Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), the father of Torres's baby, stand by. Torres's many injuries include neurological trauma. While barely conscious, she hallucinates an uninjured version of herself standing beside her. The hallucinatory Torres begins to sing, and is gradually joined by the doctors treating her. This singing continues throughout the episode, as Torres's projection of herself attempts to reach out to Robbins.\nTorres goes into cardiac arrest and is taken into an operating room she is temporarily stabilized, pending further surgery. She is moved into intensive care, while neonatal surgeon Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) is flown in by helicopter in case the baby has to be delivered prematurely. Robbins and Sloan argue over Torres's treatment; Robbins believes that Torres would not risk endangering the baby, but Sloan argues for saving Torres at all costs. The attending surgeons devise a treatment plan, led by trauma surgeon Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd). As they do so, Torres dreams about the moments preceding the accident. Her dream self sings to Robbins, interspersed with shots of the hospital staff singing and dancing with their own partners. Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) suggests treating Torres with a high-risk but potentially effective cardiothoracic procedure she learned from her old mentor, Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). Her current mentor, Teddy Altman (Kim Raver), refuses to perform it, but when Torres's condition deteriorates and she is rushed back into surgery, Hunt agrees that Yang should attempt the procedure.\nWhen Torres again goes into cardiac arrest, Montgomery delivers her daughter at twenty-three week's gestation. The baby is initially unable to breathe, so with Sloan's support, Robbins steps in and is able to revive her. Across the operating room, Torres's condition begins to improve. Once the surgery is complete, the doctors deal with their own affairs; Sloan's former partner Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) commits to her new relationship with resident Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams); Lexie's sister, Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) confesses that she was jealous of Torres's pregnancy, which prompts her husband Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) to promise that they will have a child together; Altman tells Yang that she can no longer teach her; Sloan and Robbins bond over their shared parenthood. Later, as Robbins keeps a vigil by Torres's bedside, the hallucinatory Torres is able to rouse her recovering self. As she regains consciousness, Torres accepts Robbins's proposal.\n\nProduction\nConception\nSince Grey's Anatomy began, series creator Shonda Rhimes had planned to produce a musical episode. She first discussed the idea during filming of the pilot episode, when the program was as yet untitled. Rhimes felt that seasons 6 and 7 were the right time for the crew to \"try anything and everything [they had] always wanted to do,\" and explained that she \"finally [had] the right idea and the right talent to make [a musical episode] happen.\" Filming began 7-and-a-half years after Rhimes initially raised the idea. The episode was shot in approximately 2 weeks. Though cast member Dempsey jokingly referred to the episode as Glee M.D., Rhimes intended for it to differ from other musical television episodes. She called it the opposite of \"Once More, with Feeling,\" the \"all-out, show-stopping,\" musical episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, as she aimed to \"do something that was musical without being a musical.\"Rhimes said she had difficulty getting the network's permission. She added: \"I begged the studio people. I begged the network people. I took these people to dinner and begged. I jumped out at these people in bathrooms and begged. And they all smiled politely but what they were clearly really thinking was, 'This woman is an idiot.'\"Rhimes also told about delays in producing this episode: \n\nExplaining what the heck took us so long is too complicated to go into here. There are a lot of reasons â I was busy telling other awesome stories at Seattle Grace, [...] I was raising my tiny human, my musical talent involves oboe-playing and nothing else, the network thought it was the dumbest idea theyâd ever heard of and refused to do it. \nThe script was written by Rhimes in November 2010. She centered the episode around Ramirez's character, Callie, and stated that the storyline would have developed regardless of whether it involved musical performances. Sara Ramirez used the opportunity to launch their career as a singer-songwriter; an alternate version of \"The Story\" is included on their debut EP, released four days prior to the episode's premiere. In this episode, Mark and Arizona improve their relationship. Capshaw said, \"The traumatic circumstance leads to them having a greater understanding of each other and then appreciation, and then need for each other and desire to be in each otherâs lives. They come to care, I think, for one another.\"\n\nMusical performances\nRhimes, executive producer Betsy Beers and director Tony Phelan selected songs that had become well-known by their use in Grey's Anatomy, and chose \"the most iconic ones, the ones that best suited [their] singers, and the ones that made the most sense.\" The multiple cover versions include the program's theme tune, \"Cosy in the Rocket\" by Psapp. The primary vocalists are cast members Ramirez, McKidd, Leigh and Chandra Wilson. The soundtrack also includes \"How to Save a Life\" by The Fray and \"Running on Sunshine\" by Jesus Jackson, performed as ensemble pieces by Ramirez, McKidd, Leigh, Daniel Sunjata, Scott Foley, Ellen Pompeo, Justin Chambers, Raver, Dane, and Capshaw. Ramirez, McKidd and Wilson also perform together on Snow Patrol's \"Chasing Cars.\" Ramirez is the lead vocalist on \"The Story\" by Brandi Carlile, and \"Grace\" by Kate Havnevik, which also features the other female cast members, including Leigh and Sarah Drew on the chorus. Capshaw duets with Ramirez on KT Tunstall's \"Universe & U.\" Wilson is the lead vocalist on \"Wait\" by Get Set Go, McKidd on \"How We Operate\" by Gomez, and Leigh on Anna Nalick's \"Breathe (2 AM).\"\n\nLeigh said that some actors were not \"excited\" about singing but still could participate in the episode. \"There were certain ways in which the scenes were written, even if there was a song in there, that perhaps a line was spoken instead of sung,\" she said.A vocal coach was enlisted to help the cast. Music director Chris Horvath was recruited to arrange the selected songs for the cast. The arrangements took around two months, with vocals recorded over four days in February 2011. Horvath praised the cast's response to the episode, noting that only four performers had \"serious vocal talent,\" while some had \"barely sung in the shower\" before. Those with professional singing experience include Ramirez, who won a Tony Award for their role in the musical Spamalot, and Wilson, who appeared in the Broadway production of Caroline, or Change. Cast members' reactions toward the episode varied. Pompeo initially deemed the idea \"crazy,\" but changed her mind following the first read-through. Recurring cast member Sunjata stated that singing was \"a bit out of [his] comfort zone,\" but found it an \"interesting challenge,\" and McKidd deemed it \"very exciting to do something that's completely out on a limb for the show.\"\n\nReception\nPre-broadcast commentary\nCritical response prior to broadcast was mixed. TVLine's Michael Ausiello assessed that the episode would \"either be a show-stopping triumph or a spectacular failure,\" with no possible middle ground. William Keck of TV Guide initially had \"serious doubts,\" which were allayed by a visit to the set, during which he listened to the soundtrack. Keck likened it to the \"much-beloved early seasons of Grey's, when music played a vital role on the show.\" Entertainment Weekly's Dan Snierson predicted heavy use of Auto Tune, though fellow EW writer Jennifer Armstrong was optimistic that the episode would be a success, commenting: \"I have faith. I like musicals, I like Grey's. I'm rooting for this to work.\"\n\nRatings\nDuring its original broadcast, \"Song Beneath the Song\" was watched by an average of 13.09 million American viewers. It attained a 4.9/13 Nielsen rating/share in the 18â49 demographic, making it the second highest-rated program of the night, behind only American Idol on the Fox network. The rating was the second-highest of the seventh season until that point, and a 30% increase from the previous episode, \"This is How We Do It,\" which was watched by 2.4 million fewer viewers.In Canada, where the episode also aired on March 31, 2011, it was watched by 3.18 million viewers. Viewership again increased on \"This is How We Do It,\" which attained 2.63 million viewers. However, while the preceding episode was the most-viewed scripted show for the week of its original broadcast, \"Song Beneath the Song\" ranked second, behind The Big Bang Theory.\n\nPost-broadcast commentary\nFollowing the first minutes of the drama, reactions on Twitter were polarized. Nicole Golden from TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.5 stars out of 5.0. She found that \"overall, the concept worked since music really has always played a big part in the show. Some songs were more appropriate and/or better performed than others, though.\" She also wrote the concept worked in part because it was new but noted \"the format would probably not have the same effect if used in future episodes.\" Even though Boston Herald's critic Mark Perigard was not a fan of the concept, saying \"the Grey's Anatomy event proved how tricky it is for an established show, especially a drama, to pull off a musical episode,\" he did like several actors' performances. He wrote: \"Chandra Wilson and Chyler Leigh (whom I never have anything good to say about) delivered some impressive vocal work. Eric Dane did some of his best acting of his career last night as an anxious father-to-be terrified he would lose his best friend.\" Lyneka Little of The Wall Street Journal wrote, \"If Glee and ER had a baby it would be tonightâs episode of the medical drama Greyâs Anatomy titled 'Song Beneath the Song'.\" In his review of the episode Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote \"Like Grey's Anatomy as a whole, some parts were unintentionally silly, others were surprisingly powerful, and it was rarely dull, at least.\"Patrick Dempsey admitted that the musical episode might not have been showrunner Shonda Rhimes's best idea. He explained: \"It's very difficult to keep it fresh when you're doing 24 episodes a year. Shonda Rhimes has a lot of ideas, and she is in a position where she can take more chances. Sometimes that works, sometimes it does not. Last year we had the singing episode, which I think was a big mistake. But you have to try.\"\n\nAccolades\nIn 2011, the episode was ranked #19 on the TV Guide Network special, 25 Biggest TV Blunders 2. It was included in TV Guide's list \"The Worst Of 2011\" saying, \"Sara Ramirez has powerhouse pipes, but what this episode desperately needed was a better playlist.\" BuddyTV, however, ranked it #43 on its list of 2011's 50 Best TV Episodes and it also appeared on Digital Spy's shortlist of \"TV's Best Musical Episodes.\" Supervising Music Editor Jennifer Barak and Music Editors Carli Barber and Jessica Harrison were nominated in the Best Sound Editing: Short Form Musical in Television category at the 2012 Golden Reel Awards for their work on the episode.\n\nSoundtrack\nTrack listing\nChart history\nGrey's Anatomy: The Music Event debuted at #24 on the Billboard 200, with 19,000 copies sold. It reached #2 on the U.S. Soundtracks chart, and was #5 on the Independent Album chart. \"The Story\" entered the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart at #69, and the Canadian Hot 100 at #72.\nPassage 13:\nBeckmann rearrangement\nThe Beckmann rearrangement, named after the German chemist Ernst Otto Beckmann (1853â1923), is a rearrangement of an oxime functional group to substituted amides. The rearrangement has also been successfully performed on haloimines and nitrones. Cyclic oximes and haloimines yield lactams.\nThe Beckmann rearrangement is often catalyzed by acid; however, other reagents have been known to promote the rearrangement. These include tosyl chloride, thionyl chloride, phosphorus pentachloride, phosphorus pentoxide, triethylamine, sodium hydroxide, trimethylsilyl iodide among others. The Beckmann fragmentation is another reaction that often competes with the rearrangement, though careful selection of promoting reagent and solvent conditions can favor the formation of one over the other, sometimes giving almost exclusively one product. The rearrangement occurs stereospecifically for ketoximes and N-chloro/N-fluoro imines, with the migrating group being anti-periplanar to the leaving group on the nitrogen. Certain conditions have been known to racemize the oxime geometry, leading to the formation of both regioisomers. The rearrangement of aldoximes occurs with stereospecificity in the gas phase and without stereospecificity in the solution phase. A few methodologies allow for the rearrangement of aldoximes to primary amides, but fragmentation commonly competes in these systems. Nitrone rearrangement also occurs without stereospecificity; the regioisomer formed has the amide nitrogen substituted with the group possessing the greatest migratory aptitude.\n\nThe archetypal Beckmann rearrangement is the conversion of cyclohexanone to caprolactam via the oxime. Caprolactam is the feedstock in the production of Nylon 6.The Beckmann solution consists of acetic acid, hydrochloric acid and acetic anhydride, and was widely used to catalyze the rearrangement.  Other acids, such as sulfuric acid, polyphosphoric acid, and hydrogen fluoride have all been used. Sulfuric acid is the most commonly used acid for commercial lactam production due to its formation of an ammonium sulfate by-product when neutralized with ammonia. Ammonium sulfate is a common agricultural fertilizer providing nitrogen and sulfur.\n\nReaction mechanism\nThe most common reaction mechanism of the Beckmann rearrangement consists generally of an alkyl migration anti-periplanar to the expulsion of a leaving group to form a nitrilium ion. This is followed by solvolysis to an imidate and then tautomerization to the amide:\nThis nitrilium ion has been known to be intercepted by other nucleophiles, including the leaving group from the oxime.\n\nPresumably after the phenyl group migrates and expels the cyanate, the latter then attacks the nitrilium ion formed. In carbon tetrachloride the isocyanate can be isolated, whereas in ethanol, the urethane is formed after solvolysis of the isocyanate.\nOne computational study has established the mechanism accounting for solvent molecules and substituents. The rearrangement of acetone oxime in the Beckmann solution involved three acetic acid molecules and one proton (present as an oxonium ion). In the transition state leading to the iminium ion (Ï-complex), the methyl group migrates to the nitrogen atom in a concerted reaction as the hydroxyl group is expelled. The oxygen atom in the hydroxyl group is stabilized by three acetic acid molecules. In the next step the electrophilic carbon atom in the nitrilium ion is attacked by water and a proton is donated back to acetic acid. In the transition state leading to the imidate, the water oxygen atom is coordinated to 4 other atoms. In the third step, an isomerization step protonates the nitrogen atom leading to the amide.\n\nThe same computation with a hydroxonium ion and 6 molecules of water has the same result, but when the migrating substituent is a phenyl group, the mechanism favors the formation of an intermediate three-membered Ï-complex. This Ï-complex is not found in the H3O+(H2O)6.\n\nWith the cyclohexanone-oxime, the relief of ring strain results in a third reaction mechanism, leading directly to the protonated caprolactam in a single concerted step without the intermediate formation of a Ï-complex or Ï-complex.\n\nCyanuric chloride assisted Beckmann reaction\nBeckmann rearrangement can be rendered catalytic using cyanuric chloride and zinc chloride as a co-catalyst. For example, cyclododecanone can be converted to the corresponding lactam, the monomer used in the production of Nylon 12.\n\nThe reaction mechanism for this reaction is based on a catalytic cycle with cyanuric chloride activating the hydroxyl group via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. The reaction product is dislodged and replaced by new reactant via an intermediate Meisenheimer complex.\n\nBeckmann fragmentation\nThe Beckmann fragmentation is a reaction that frequently competes with the Beckmann rearrangement. When the group Î± to the oxime is capable of stabilizing carbocation formation, the fragmentation becomes a viable reaction pathway. The reaction generates a nitrile and a carbocation, which is quickly intercepted to form a variety of products. The nitrile can also be hydrolyzed under reaction conditions to give carboxylic acids. Different reaction conditions can favor the fragmentation over the rearrangement.\n\nQuaternary carbon centers promote fragmentation by stabilizing carbocation formation through hyperconjugation. As shown in the above picture, the \"stable\" carbocation is formed, which then loses a hydrogen to give a site of unsaturation. Oxygen and nitrogen atoms also promote fragmentation through the formation of ketones and imines respectively.\nSulfur is also capable of promoting fragmentation, albeit at a longer range than oxygen or nitrogen.\n\nSilicon is capable of directing the fragmentation through the beta-silicon effect.\nThe carbocation intermediate in this reaction is intercepted by nucleophilic fluoride from diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST):\n\nSemmlerâWolff reaction\nThe oxime of cyclohexenone with acid forms aniline in a dehydration â aromatization reaction called the SemmlerâWolff reaction or Wolff aromatization \nThe mechanism can be shown as below:\n\nThe reaction is intrinsically a special case of Beckmann rearrangement combined with neighbouring group participation.\n\nApplications in drug synthesis\nAn industrial synthesis of paracetamol developed by HoechstâCelanese involves the conversion of a methyl ketone to an acetanilide via a Beckmann rearrangement.The thermal rearrangement that occurs in the synthesis of ketamine was claimed to be a Beckmann rearrangement according to: url.\n\nSee also\nCurtius rearrangement\nDakin reaction\nSchmidt reaction\nStieglitz rearrangement\nLossen rearrangement\nPassage 14:\nHeartbeat in the Brain\nHeartbeat in the Brain is a 1970 documentary film produced and directed by Amanda Feilding, an advocate of trepanation.

It was released as a single from their third album of the same name and was also the theme song for the 1982 film Rocky III, which was released a day before the single. The song was written by Survivor guitarist Frankie Sullivan and keyboardist Jim Peterik, and it was recorded at the request of Rocky III star, writer, and director Sylvester Stallone, after Queen denied him permission to use \"Another One Bites the Dust\", the song Stallone intended as the Rocky III theme. The version of the song that appears in the film is the demo version of the song. The film version also contained tiger growls, which did not appear on the album version. It features original Survivor singer Dave Bickler on lead vocals. The song is also the title song to the 1986 film of the same name. \"Eye of the Tiger\" is written in the key of C minor.It gained tremendous MTV and radio airplay and topped charts worldwide during 1982. In the United States, it held No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for six consecutive weeks (the band's only song to top the chart) and was the No. 2 single of 1982, behind Olivia Newton-John's \"Physical\". It spent fifteen consecutive weeks in the top ten, the second-longest run of 1982, behind \"Hurts So Good\" by John Mellencamp (which was prevented from reaching the top of the Hot 100 by \"Eye of the Tiger\"). This top ten run is tied with the aforementioned \"Another One Bites the Dust\" as well as \"Physical\" as the longest run in the top ten for a number one song during the entire 1980s decade. The band won an award for \"Best Rock Performance by Duo or Group with Vocal\" at the 25th Annual Grammy Awards. In September 1982, it also peaked at No. 1 in the United Kingdom, remaining at the top of the UK Singles Chart for four consecutive weeks. The single sold 956,000 copies in United Kingdom in 1982.It was certified platinum in August 1982 by the RIAA, signifying sales of 2 million vinyl copies. The song had sold over 4.1 million in digital downloads in the United States alone by February 2015. It was voted VH1's 63rd-greatest hard rock song.\n\nBackground\nIn an interview with Songfacts, co-writer Jim Peterik, who shared writing credit with Frankie Sullivan, explained the song's title.\n\nAt first, we wondered if calling it \"Eye of the Tiger\" was too obvious. The initial draft of the song, we started with \"It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight, rising up to the spirit of our rival, and the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night, and it all comes down to survival.\" We were going to call the song \"Survival\". In the rhyme scheme, you can tell we had set up \"rival\" to rhyme with \"survival\". At the end of the day, we said, \"Are we nuts?\" That hook is so strong, and \"rival\" doesn't have to be a perfect rhyme with the word \"tiger\". We made the right choice and went with \"Eye of the Tiger\".\n\nAccolades\nThe song was nominated for the 1982 Academy Award for Best Original Song (the only Oscar nomination for Rocky III), but it lost to \"Up Where We Belong\" from An Officer and a Gentleman.The band won an award for \"Best Rock Performance by Duo or Group with Vocal\" at the 25th Annual Grammy Awards. The song was also nominated for the 1983 Grammy Award for Song of the Year, but lost to the Willie Nelson hit \"Always on My Mind\".\n\nLawsuits\nNewt Gingrich campaign\nIn 2012, Survivor sued Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich in Illinois federal court for using \"Eye of the Tiger\" without authorization as entrance music at his political rallies going back as far as 2009. The suit was later settled out of court.\n\nMitt Romney campaign\nThe same year Sullivan also demanded that Mitt Romney, also a Republican candidate for president, should stop using \"Eye of the Tiger\" at his campaign rallies. Romney agreed to drop the song from the campaign's playlists.\n\nMike Huckabee's campaign\nFrankie Sullivan's company Rude Music filed a lawsuit in federal court in Chicago, Illinois, on November 18, 2015, against the former Governor of Arkansas and Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee's campaign organization for using \"Eye of the Tiger\" at a political rally without permission. The rally took place on September 8, 2015, when Kim Davis, a Kentucky county clerk, was released from jail after spending five days there for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in Kentucky. In June 2016 it was reported by CNN that Huckabee had agreed, in a confidential, out-of-court settlement with Sullivan's Rude Music, to pay $25,000 in compensation.\n\nCredits and personnel\nCredits adapted from the album Eye of the Tiger.\nDave Bickler â lead vocals\nFrankie Sullivan â lead and rhythm guitars\nJim Peterik â grand piano, electric guitar\nStephan Ellis â bass\nMarc Droubay â drums\n\nCharts\nWeekly charts\nCertifications\nSee also\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nMedicare pays for laboratory tests that are performed individually or in a group. For individual tests, laboratories submit claims to Medicare for each test they perform that is on the CLFS; tests are identified using a billing code. Prior to the implementation of PAMA in 2018, the payment rates on the CLFS were based on rates charged for laboratory tests in 1984 through 1985 adjusted for inflation. Additionally, 57 geographic jurisdictions had their own fee schedules for laboratory tests. CMS used the 57 separate fee schedules to calculate a national limitation amount, which served as the maximum payment for individual laboratory tests. Thus, the payment rate for an individual test was the lesser of the amount claimed by the laboratory, the local fee for a geographic area, or the national limitation amount for a particular test. Medicare pays bundled payment rates for certain laboratory tests that are performed as a group, called panel tests. Panel tests can be divided into two categoriesâthose without billing codes and those with billing codes. Panel tests without billing codes are composed of at least 2 of 23 distinct component tests. Additionally, there are 7 specific combinations of these 23 component tests that are commonly used and have their own billing code. Prior to 2018, Medicare paid for both types of panel tests (those without or with a billing code) using a bundled rate based on the number of tests performed, with modest payment increases for each additional test conducted. For example, in 2017, Medicare paid $7.15 for panel tests with two component tests and $9.12 for panel tests with 3 component tests, with a maximum bundled payment rate of $16.64 for all 23 component tests. Prior to 2018, the Medicare Administrative Contractors would count the number of tests performed before determining the appropriate bundled payment rate. For those panel tests with a billing code, the payment rate was the same if laboratories used the associated billing code for the panel test or listed each of the component tests separately. After PAMAâs implementation in 2018, the 57 separate fee schedules for individual laboratory tests were replaced with a single national fee schedule. The payment rates for this single national fee schedule were based on private-payer rates for laboratory tests paid from January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016. Specifically, the payment rate for an individual test was generally based on the median private-payer rates for a given test, weighted by test volume. Payment for panel tests also changed in 2018. For panel tests without billing codes, Medicare Administrative Contractors no longer counted the number of component tests performed to determine the bundled payment rate; instead, Medicare paid the separate rate for each component test in the panel. For panel tests with a billing code, the payment rate depended on how the laboratory submitted the claim. If a laboratory used the billing code associated with the panel test, Medicare paid the bundled payment rate for that billing code. If a laboratory submitted a claim for the panel test, but listed each of the component tests separately instead of using the panel testâs billing code, Medicare paid the individual payment rate for each component test. Table 1 below summarizes the changes to payment rates before and after 2018. Multiple types of laboratories receive payment under Medicare. The three laboratory types that received the most revenue from the CLFS in 2016 were independent laboratories, hospital-outreach laboratories, and physician-office laboratories. (See table 2.) Estimates of the size of the total U.S. laboratory market vary. For example, the Healthcare Fraud Prevention Partnership estimated that the laboratory industry received $87 billion in revenue in 2017, while another market report estimated the laboratory industry received $75 billion in revenue in 2016. Similar to Medicare, the three laboratory types that generally receive the most revenue overall are independent laboratories, hospital-outreach laboratories, and physician-office laboratories, when laboratory tests performed in hospital inpatient and outpatient settings were excluded. Estimates of revenue received by these laboratories also vary. For example, in recent years, estimates of the share of laboratory industry revenue generated by independent laboratories ranged from 37 percent to 54 percent. Additionally, estimates of revenue generated by hospital- outreach laboratories recently ranged from 21 to 35 percent, and physician-office laboratories ranged from 4 to 11 percent of total laboratory industry revenue. Private-payer rates for laboratory tests conducted by the three largest laboratory types generally vary by type and other characteristics, according to market reports and the laboratory industry officials we interviewed. Independent laboratories. These laboratories generally receive lower private-payer rates than other types of laboratories, according to industry officials we interviewed. Market reports we reviewed noted that about half of the independent laboratory market is dominated by two national laboratories and that these national laboratories provide more competitive pricing by performing a large volume of tests at one time. Medicare accounted for a smaller proportion of the revenue earned by these two national laboratories (12 percent), compared to other laboratories, according to another market report we reviewed. In contrast, a different market report noted that smaller, independent laboratories tend to earn more of their revenue from Medicare (34 percent). Hospital-outreach laboratories. These hospital-affiliated laboratories typically receive relatively higher private-payer rates, according to industry officials we interviewed. Although hospital- outreach laboratories perform tests similar to other laboratories, they can obtain above-average payment rates by leveraging the market power of their affiliated hospital when negotiating rates with private payers, according to industry officials and market reports. Hospital-outreach laboratories generally receive about 25 to 30 percent of their revenue from the Medicare CLFS. Physician-office laboratories. Physician-office laboratories typically receive higher private-payer rates than independent laboratories, according to a recent analysis by a laboratory industry association. This industry association also noted that the cost structure to operate in a setting such as a physician-office laboratory is different than in large independent laboratories, as the physician-office laboratory is unable to conduct a large number of tests at one time. Officials from another industry association we interviewed said that payment rates for these laboratories are generally dependent on the size of the physician practice group. These same officials told us that larger physician groups (e.g., 10 or more physicians) typically negotiate higher rates from private payers than smaller physician groups. Most physician-office laboratories received less than $25,000 in revenue per year from Medicare, according to CMS. Additionally, in 2013, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General found that Medicareâs payment rates on the CLFS were higher than rates paid by some private health insurance plans. Specifically, it found that Medicare rates for laboratory tests were 18 percent to 30 percent higher than rates paid by certain insurers under health benefits plans for federal employees. Definition of Applicable Laboratories Required to Report Private-Payer Data to CMS CMS defined applicable laboratories as those meeting four criteria: (1) they met the definition of laboratory under regulations implementing the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988; (2) they billed Medicare Part B under their own Medicare billing number, also called the national provider identifier; (3) more than 50 percent of their total Medicare revenues came from the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS) and/or the Physician Fee Schedule; and (4) they received at least $12,500 in Medicare revenue from the CLFS from January 1, 2016, through June 30, 2016. CMS analyzed private-payer data it collected from about 2,000 laboratories to develop new payment rates for individual laboratory tests on the CLFS. PAMA defined laboratories required to report private-payer data, called applicable laboratories, as laboratories that meet certain criteria. (See sidebar.) Applicable laboratories with their own specific billing number, the NPI, submitted these data to CMS. If one organization operated multiple applicable laboratories, each with its own NPI, then the organization could report data to CMS for multiple applicable laboratories. CMS collected data from applicable laboratories on payments they received from private payers during the first half of 2016. Specifically, CMS collected data on (1) the unique billing code associated with a laboratory test; (2) the private-payer rate for each laboratory test for which final payment was made during the data collection period (January 1, 2016, through June 30, 2016); and (3) the volume of tests performed for each unique billing code at that private- payer rate. For the data CMS collected between January 1, 2017, and May 30, 2017, CMS relied on the entities reporting to CMS to attest to the completeness and accuracy of the data they submitted. CMS relied on each laboratory to identify whether or not it was an applicable laboratory and took steps to assist laboratories in meeting reporting requirements. According to CMS officials, they relied on laboratories to self-identify as applicable laboratories because they were unable to accurately identify the number of laboratories required to report. To assist laboratories, CMS issued multiple guidance documents to the industry outlining the criteria for being an applicable laboratory and describing the type of data CMS intended to collect. CMS also conducted educational calls when the proposed and final rules were issued and prior to the data collection period. CMS officials told us they conducted additional outreach activities, including holding conference calls with national laboratory associations and attending professional conferences. Officials said they used these outreach activities in addition to the guidance issued to inform laboratories of the reporting requirements for applicable laboratories, for example. In addition, CMS established a revenue threshold of $12,500 in an effort to reduce the reporting burden for entities that receive a relatively small amount of revenues under the CLFS. In its final rule, CMS noted that it expected that many of the laboratories that would be below this revenue threshold and, thus exempt from reporting data to CMS, would be physician-office laboratories. CMS also chose to use the NPI in its definition of applicable laboratory in the final rule to allow hospital- outreach laboratories that use their own NPI to submit data to the agency. In its proposed rule, CMS suggested using an alternative identification number to the NPI. However, according to the final rule, CMS chose to use the NPI in its definition of applicable laboratory to allow those hospital-outreach laboratories billing using their own NPI to submit private-payer data to the agency. According to CMS, at the end of the 5-month submission period, the agency had received data from approximately 2,000 applicable laboratories, representing a volume of almost 248 million laboratory tests; these data accounted for about $31 billion in revenue from private payers. CMS reported that the data it collected included private-payer rates for 96 percent of the 1,347 eligible billing codes on the CLFS. CMS used these data to calculate a median, private-payer rate, weighted by volume and phased in this change by limiting payment-rate reductions to 10 percent per year. Beginning in 2018, these new payment rates served as the single, national payment rate for individual laboratory tests. These payment rates were also used for the individual, component tests that make up panel tests and were used when laboratories billed Medicare for panel tests by listing the component tests separately. In general, the median payments rates, weighted for volume, that CMS calculated were lower than Medicareâs previous payment rates for most laboratory tests. According to our analysis, these median payment rates were lower than the corresponding 2017 CLFS national limitation amounts (the maximum that CMS would pay for laboratory tests) for approximately 88 percent of tests. Figure 1 below describes the percentage difference between these median payment rates and Medicareâs 2017 national limitation amounts for laboratory tests. The final payment rates that CMS calculated, which included the 10- percent, phased in, payment-rate reductions, will remain in effect until December 31, 2020; PAMA requires CMS to calculate new payment rates for the CLFS every 3 years. Reporting entities will next be required to submit data on private-payer rates to CMS in early 2020, for final payments made from January 1, 2019 through June 30, 2019. PAMA capped any reductions for the second 3-year cycle after implementation to a maximum of 15 percent per year. CMS did not collect private-payer data from all laboratories required to report this information and did not estimate how much data was not reported by these laboratories, according to agency officials. CMS relied on laboratories to determine whether they met data reporting requirements and submit data accordingly. CMS emphasized the importance of receiving data from all laboratories required to report by stating that it is critical that CMS collect complete data on private-payer rates in order to set accurate Medicare rates. However, agency officials told us that CMS did not receive data from all laboratories required to report. They also told us that CMS did not have the information available to estimate how much data was missing because not all laboratories reported or the extent to which the data collected were representative of all of the data that laboratories were required to report. Prior to collecting private-payer data, CMS estimated that laboratories subject to reporting requirements would receive more than 90 percent of CLFS expenditures to physician-office laboratories and independent laboratories. Specifically, based on its analysis of 2013 Medicare expenditures, CMS estimated that reporting requirements would apply to the laboratories that received 92 percent of CLFS payments to physician- office laboratories and 99 percent of CLFS payments to independent laboratories. After laboratories reported private-payer data, we analyzed the share of CLFS expenditures received by the laboratories that reported. Our analysis found that CMS collected data from laboratories that received the majority of CLFS payments to physician-office, independent, and other non-hospital laboratories in 2016. However, the laboratories that reported private-payer data received less than 70 percent of CLFS expenditures to physician-office, independent, and other non-hospital laboratories. Specifically, using Medicare claims data, we calculated that CMS collected data from laboratories that received 68 percent of 2016 CLFS payments to physician-office, independent, and other non-hospital laboratories. Although it did not collect complete data, CMS concluded that it collected sufficient private-payer data to set Medicare payment rates and that collecting more data from additional laboratories that were required to report would not significantly affect Medicare expenditures. This conclusion was based, in part, on a sensitivity analyses that CMS conducted of the effects that collecting certain types and amounts of additional data would have on weighted median private-payer rates and the effects those rates could have on Medicare payment rates and, thus, expenditures. Results from these analyses showed that Medicare expenditures based on the CLFS would have changed by 2 percent or less after collecting more data from the various types of laboratories. For example, CMS estimated that doubling the amount of private-payer data from physician-office laboratories would increase expenditures by 2 percent and collecting ten times as much data from hospital outreach laboratories would increase expenditures by 1 percent. (See fig. 2.) PAMAâs 10-percent limit on annual payment-rate reductions likely reduced the effect that incomplete private-payer data could have on the CLFS because this limit applied to most Medicare payment rates for laboratory tests. As demonstrated in figure 1, while 59 percent of tests had median private-payer rates that were at least 30 percent less than their respective 2017 national limitation amounts, CMS published Medicare rates for these tests for 2018 through 2020 that were reduced by only 10 percent per year as a result of this limit. For example, a hypothetical laboratory test with a 2017 CLFS national limitation amount of $10.00 and a median private-payer rate of $7.00 would result in CLFS rates of $9.00 in 2018, $8.10 in 2019, and $7.29 in 2020. Changes to median private-payer rates due to collecting more complete data or eliminating inaccurate data would have no effect on Medicare payment rates from 2018 through 2020 for this hypothetical test if they resulted in new median rates of $7.29 or less. Our analysis of the potential effects that collecting data from additional laboratories could have had on Medicare payment rates and expenditures found that the effect of CMS not collecting complete data would likely have been greater absent PAMAâs limits on annual reductions to Medicare payment rates. As a result, CMS may face challenges setting accurate Medicare rates if it does not collect complete data from all laboratories required to report in the future when PAMA allows for greater annual payment-rate reductions. To conduct this analysis, we used the private-payer data CMS collected to analyze the range of effects that collecting additional data could have on Medicare expenditures, assuming 2016 utilization rates remain constant. The extent of these effects depends on the amount of additional data CMS would need to collect to obtain complete data and whether the payment rates in these additional data would have been greater or less than the medians of the rates reported. For example, we estimated that if CMS needed to collect 20 percent more data for its collection to be complete, doing so could increase Medicare CLFS expenditures from 2018 through 2020 by as much as 3 percent or reduce them by as much as 3 percent depending on the payment rates in these additional data. However, if annual limits to Medicare payment-rate reductions were not applied, collecting these additional data could increase CLFS expenditures by as much as 9 percent or reduce them by as much as 9 percent. (See fig. 3 and app. II for additional information about these estimates.) As demonstrated in figure 2, CMS did analyze how collecting certain types and amounts of data from additional laboratories would affect Medicare expenditures. However, without valid estimates of how much more data these additional laboratories were required to report and how much these data would change median payment rates, it remains unknown whether CMSâs analyses estimate the actual risk of setting Medicare payment rates that do not reflect private-payer rates from all applicable laboratories, as mandated by PAMA. CMS could have compared the data it collected with independent information on the payment rates laboratories were required to report, for example. The independent information could be estimated by auditing a random sample of laboratories or could be estimated using data from third-party vendors, if these vendors could supply relevant and reliable information. We found that CMS mitigated challenges to setting accurate Medicare payment rates by identifying, analyzing, and responding to potentially inaccurate private-payer data. CMS addressed potentially inaccurate private-payer data and other data that CMS determined did not meet reporting requirements. CMS removed or replaced data from four reporting entities that appeared to have or confirmed having reported revenueâwhich is the payment rate multiplied by the volume of tests paid at that rateâinstead of payment rates. We estimated that if CMS had included these data that CLFS expenditures from 2018 through 2020 would have increased by 7 percent. CMS removed data it determined were reported in error including duplicate submissions and submissions with payment rates of $0.00. We estimated that removing these data will change CLFS expenditures from 2018 through 2020 by less than one percent. CMS identified four other types of potentially inaccurate data that it determined would not significantly impact Medicare payment rates or expenditures and did not exclude them from calculations of median private-payer rates. CMS considered the following potentially inaccurate data to have met its reporting requirements: 1. data from 57 entities that reported particularly high rates in at least 60 percent of their data, 2. data from 12 entities that reported particularly low rates in at least 50 percent of their data, 3. data with payment rates that were 10 times greater than the 2017 national limitation amounts or 10 times less than these amounts, and 4. data from laboratories that may not have met the $12,500 low- expenditure threshold or that reported data from a hospital NPI instead of a laboratory NPI. We found that each of these four types of potentially inaccurate data would have changed estimated Medicare CLFS expenditures from 2018 through 2020 by 1 percent or less if CMS had instead excluded the data. To conduct this analysis, we recalculated Medicare rates after excluding each type of data and estimated Medicare expenditures assuming 2016 rates of utilization. Although weighted median private-payer rates were lower than Medicareâs 2017 national limitation amounts for 88 percent of tests, we estimated the total Medicare expenditures based on the 2018 CLFS would likely increase by 3 percent ($225 million overall) compared to 2016 expenditures, assuming test utilization remained at 2016 levels. This increase in estimated expenditures is due, in part, to CMSâs use of above-average payment rates as a baseline to calculate payment rates for those laboratory tests affected by PAMAâs annual payment-rate reduction limit of 10 percent. (See fig. 4.) When applying the 10-percent payment-rate reduction limit, CMS used as its starting point the 2017 national limitation amounts in order to set a single, national payment rate for each laboratory test. Thus, the Medicare payment rate for a test in 2018 could not be less than 90 percent of the testâs 2017 national limitation amount. However, prior to 2018, some payment rates were commonly lower than the national limitation amounts because they were based on the lesser of (1) the amount billed on claims, (2) the local fee for a geographic area, or (3) a national limitation amount, and because panel tests had different bundled payment rates. As a result, by reducing payment rates from national limitation amounts, CMS did not always reduce rates from what Medicare actually paid. Panel tests, in particular, frequently received bundled payment rates that differed substantially from national limitation amounts associated with their billing codes prior to 2018. We compared national limitation amounts, which represent maximum Medicare payment rates for tests, with the average amounts Medicare allowed for payment in 2016, which reflect actual Medicare payment rates. For example, figure 5 below shows that the 2017 national limitation amount for comprehensive metabolic panel tests ($14.49) was substantially higher than both the average amount Medicare allowed for payment in 2016 ($11.45) and the median payment rate laboratories reported receiving from private payers ($9.08). As a result, using the 2017 national limitation amount as a basis for payment reductions caused Medicareâs payment rate to increase from an average allowed amount of $11.45 in 2016, to a payment rate of $13.04 in 2018, instead of decreasing towards a lower median private- payer rate of $9.08. By increasing average payment rates rather than phasing in reductions to rates, CMSâs implementation may lead to paying more than necessary for some tests. Federal standards for internal control for information and communications require agency management to use quality information to achieve its objectives. Basing reductions on national limitation amounts rather than more relevant information on how much Medicare actually paidâsuch as the average allowable amounts in 2016, for exampleâcould result in Medicare paying more than necessary by $733 million from 2018 through 2020, according to our estimates. In implementing PAMA, CMS eliminated bundled rates for panel tests that lack billing codes and started paying separately for each component test instead. CMS also implemented the 2018 CLFS in a manner that could lead to unbundling payment rates for panel tests with billing codes. If payment rates for all panel tests were unbundled, we estimated that Medicare expenditures could increase by $218 million for panel tests that lack billing codes and by as much as $10.1 billion for panel tests with billing codes from 2018 through 2020. CMS also estimated that there could be significant risks of paying more than necessary associated with unbundling and has taken initial steps to monitor these risks and explore possible responses, but had not yet responded to these risks as of July 2018. CMS Unbundled Payment Rates for Panel Tests without Billing Codes Beginning in 2018, CMS no longer uses bundled payment rates for panel tests without billing codes and instead pays laboratories individual payments for each component test that comprises these panel tests. However, CMS staff and members of its advisory panel discussed concerns with this approach. At an advisory panel meeting in 2016, CMS staff relayed concerns from stakeholders that CMS would not be able to collect valid data on private-payer rates for these panel tests. According to agency staff, stakeholders had informed CMS that private payers commonly use bundled payment rates for these panel tests, but laboratories would only be able to report unbundled payment rates for individual component tests. We estimated that unbundling these payment rates would increase Medicare expenditures from 2018 through 2020 by $218 million in comparison to the estimated Medicare expenditures over the same time period based on Medicareâs 2016 utilization and allowable amounts. For example, under the 2016 CLFS, Medicare paid approximately 435,000 claims for panel tests that included the laboratory tests assay of creatinine (HCPCS code 82565) and assay of urea nitrogen (HCPCS code 84520) at an average bundled payment rate of $6.82. In contrast, under the 2018 CLFS, these two component tests are reimbursed individually at $6.33 and $4.88, respectively, or $11.21 combinedâa 63 percent increase. Despite concerns about the validity of available private-payer data on component tests for panel tests without billing codes, CMS used these data to set payment rates for component tests. CMS officials told us that they stopped using bundled payment rates for these panel tests because it is not clear that CMS has the authority to combine the individual component tests into groups for bundled payment as it did before 2018 due to PAMAâs reference to payments for each test. However, in July 2018, CMS officials told us the agency was reviewing its authority regarding this issue. CMS officials told us they are exploring alternative approaches that could limit increases to Medicare expenditures but had not yet determined what additional legal authority would be needed, if any, and did not know when CMS would make this determination. Agency officials told us that CMS has taken initial steps to monitor unbundling and explore possible responses, including the following: Monitoring unbundling: CMS has begun monitoring changes in panel test utilization, payment rates, and expenditures associated with its implementation of PAMA, according to officials. For example, CMS officials told us that preliminary data indicated that Medicare payments for individual component tests of panel tests has increased substantially in 2018, but, as of July 2018, it was too early to draw conclusions from these data because laboratories have up to one year to submit claims for tests. Collecting input on alternatives: In 2016, a subcommittee of an advisory panel that CMS established reviewed Medicareâs use of bundled payment rates for panel tests and published different approaches for CMS to consider implementing in combination with other changes to implement PAMA. CMSâs Implementation of PAMA May Have Allowed Unbundling of Payment Rates for Panel Tests with Billing Codes Beginning in 2018, laboratories that submit claims for any of the seven panel tests with billing codes by using the billing codes for the individual component tests now receive the payment rate for each component test, rather than the bundled rate. Prior to 2018, laboratories could submit claims for these panel tests either by using the specific codes for panel tests or by billing separately for each of the component tests, and, regardless of how laboratories submitted claims, Medicare Administrative Contractors would pay bundled payment rates based on how many of the 23 component tests were conducted. However, CMS instructed Medicare Administrative Contractors to stop bundling payment rates for tests that are billed individually on claims rather than billed on claims using codes for panel tests, beginning in 2018. CMS did so because it was not clear that CMS had the authority to combine the individual component tests into groups for bundled payment as it did before 2018 due to PAMAâs reference to payments for individual tests, according to agency officials. This change could potentially have a large effect on Medicare spending. For example, if a laboratory submitted a claim individually for the 14 component tests that comprise a comprehensive metabolic panel it would receive a payment of $81.91, a 528 percent increase from the 2018 Medicare bundled payment rate of $13.04 for this panel test. (See fig. 6.) Improving how reductions to payment rates for panel tests are phased in could mitigate, but not completely counteract, the effect of unbundling these payment rates. For example, for the comprehensive metabolic panel test described in figure 6, basing maximum reductions on 2016 average allowable amounts would result in a 2018 Medicare bundled payment rate of $10.31 instead of $13.04 and individual payment rates for the 14 component tests that total $56.06âa 32 percent decrease from $81.91 that Medicare would otherwise pay. If the payment rate for each panel test with a billing code were unbundled, we estimated that Medicare expenditures for these tests from 2018 through 2020 could reach $13.5 billion, a $10.1 billion increase from the $3.3 billion we estimated Medicare would spend using the bundled payment rates in the CLFS. Similarly, prior to implementing PAMA, CMS estimated that Medicare expenditures to physician-office, independent, and other non-hospital laboratories could potentially increase as much as $2.5 billion in 2018, alone if it paid for the same number of panel tests with billing codes as it did in 2016 but paid for each component test individually. These estimates represent an upper limit on the increased expenditures that could occur if every laboratory stopped using panel test billing codes and instead used the billing codes for individual component tests. We do not know the extent to which laboratories will stop filing claims using panel test billing codes. CMS officials also told us that they were aware of the risks associated with paying for the individual component tests instead of the bundled payment rate for a panel test with a billing code. However, CMS guidance, which was effective in 2018, continued to allow laboratories to use the billing codes for individual component tests rather than the billing code for the panel. CMS officials explained that this was due to PAMAâs reference to payments for individual tests, similar to CMSâs decision to stop paying bundled rates for panel tests without billing codes. At the time we did our work, CMS had not implemented a response to these risks but had taken some initial steps to monitor unbundling and consider alternative approaches to Medicare payment rates for these tests. HHS provided additional information on planned activities to address these risks in its written comments on a draft of this report. (See app. III.) CMS collected data on private-payer rates from laboratories that were required to report these data, but not all laboratories complied with the reporting requirement, and the extent of noncompliance remains unclear. PAMAâs provision directing CMS to phase in payment-rate reductions to Medicare payment rates likely moderates the potential adverse effects of incomplete private-payer data. However, in the future, failing to collect complete data could substantially affect Medicare payment rates because private-payer rates alone will determine Medicare payment rates. In addition, we estimated that Medicare expenditures on laboratory tests will be $733 million higher from 2018 through 2020, because CMS started phasing in payment-rate reductions from national limitation amounts instead of more relevant data on actual payment rates, such as average allowable amounts. Finally, changes to payment rates, billing practices, and testing practices could increase Medicare expenditures by as much as $10.3 billion from 2018 through 2020, if CMS does not address the risks associated with unbundling payment rates for panel tests. Agency officials indicated that it was unclear if PAMA limited CMSâs ability to combine individual component tests into groups for bundled payment, and, as of July 2018, CMS was reviewing this matter but did not know when it would make a determination. We are making the following three recommendations to CMS: The Administrator of CMS should take steps to collect all of the data from all laboratories that are required to report. If only partial data can be collected, CMS should estimate how incomplete data would affect Medicare payment rates and address any significant challenges to setting accurate Medicare rates. (Recommendation 1) The Administrator of CMS should phase in payment-rate reductions that start from the actual payment rates Medicare paid prior to 2018 rather than the national limitation amounts. CMS should revise these rates as soon as practicable to prevent paying more than necessary. (Recommendation 2) The Administrator of CMS should use bundled rates for panel tests, consistent with its practice prior to 2018, rather than paying for them individually; if necessary, the Administrator of CMS should seek legislative authority to do so. (Recommendation 3) We provided a draft of this report to HHS for review and comment. HHs provided written comments, which are reproduced in appendix III. HHS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. HHS concurred with our first recommendation to take steps to collect all data from laboratories required to report and commented that it is evaluating ways to increase reporting. In particular, in a November 2018 final rule, HHS changed the definition of an applicable laboratory, which it expects will increase the number of laboratories required to report data on private-payer rates to the agency. HHS neither agreed nor disagreed with our second recommendation to phase in payment-rate reductions that start from the actual payment rates Medicare paid prior to 2018. HHS noted that any changes to the phasing in of payment-rate reductions would need to be implemented through rulemaking. We estimated that by using the national limitation amounts as a starting point for these reductions, Medicare expenditures would increase by $733 million from 2018 through 2020. For this reason, we continue to believe CMS should revise these rates as soon as practicable and through whatever mechanism CMS determines appropriate. HHS neither agreed nor disagreed with our third recommendation to use bundled rates for panel tests. However, HHS commented that it is taking steps to address this issue. More specifically, for panel tests with billing codes, HHS is working to implement an automated process to identify claims for panel tests that should receive bundled payments, similar to the process used to bundle payment rates for these panel tests prior to PAMAâs implementation and anticipates implementing this change by the summer of 2019. In addition, HHS posted guidance on November 14, 2018, stating that the panel tests with billing codes, laboratories should submit claims using the corresponding code rather than the codes for the separate component tests beginning in 2019. To reduce the potential of paying more than necessary, we believe it is important that CMS implement its proposed automated process to allow for these payments as soon as possible. In contrast, for panel tests without billing codes, HHS commented that it is continuing to review its authority and considering other approaches to payment for these panel tests, such as adding codes to the CLFS. We estimate that unbundling the payment for these panel tests could increase Medicare expenditures by $218 million from 2018 through 2020 compared to expenditures based on Medicareâs 2016 utilization, and the actual amount could be higher if utilization increases. For this reason, we believe CMS should implement bundled payment rates for these panel tests to avoid excess payments.

CMS issued laboratory billing codes subject to data collection and reporting. CMS issued guidance to laboratories for collecting and reporting data. CMS held a Medicare Advisory Panel on Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory Tests meeting. CMS issued the CLFS data reporting template. CMS collected data on (1) the billing code associated with a laboratory test; (2) the private-payer rate for each laboratory test for which final payment was made during the data collection period (i.e., January 1, 2016, through June 30, 2016); and (3) the volume of tests performed for each billing code at that private-payer rate. CMS issued additional guidance for laboratories as the data collection period began. CMS issued the CLFS fee-for-service data collection userâs manual. CMS issued revised guidance to laboratories for collecting and reporting data. CMS held a Medicare Advisory Panel on Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory Tests meeting. CMS released the proposed CLFS rates. CMS held a Medicare Advisory Panel on Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory Tests meeting. Deadline for stakeholders to submit comments on the proposed CLFS rates to CMS. CMS issued the final CLFS rates. New CLFS rates became effective. Table 4 below demonstrates the challenges the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) faces in setting accurate Medicare payment rates to the extent it does not collect complete data from laboratories on private-payer rates. Specifically, the table shows the potential effect that collecting additional data for each laboratory test could have on Medicare expenditures and how this effect could vary depending on (1) the amount of additional data collected, (2) payment rates in the additional data, and (3) limits to annual reductions in Medicare payment rates. These limits are in place from 2018 through 2023 to phase in changes to payment rates. In addition to the contact named above, Martin T.

{"group": "Summarization", "dataset": "gov_report", "article": "You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nWe found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five selected VA medical centers required reviews of a total of 148 providersâ clinical care after concerns were raised about their care, but officials at these medical centers could not provide documentation to show that almost half of these reviews were conducted. We found that all five VA medical centers lacked at least some documentation of the reviews they told us they conducted, and in some cases, we found that the required reviews were not conducted at all. Specifically, across the five VA medical centers, we found the following: The medical centers lacked documentation showing that one type of reviewâfocused professional practice evaluations (FPPE) for causeâhad been conducted for 26 providers after concerns had been raised about their care. FPPEs for cause are reviews of providersâ care over a specified period of time, during which the provider continues to see patients and has the opportunity to demonstrate improvement. Documentation of these reviews is explicitly required under VHA policy. Additionally, VA medical center officials confirmed that FPPEs for cause that were required for another 21 providers were never conducted. The medical centers lacked documentation showing that retrospective reviewsâwhich assess the care previously delivered by a provider during a specific period of timeâ had been conducted for 8 providers after concerns had been raised about their clinical care. One medical center lacked documentation showing that reviews had been conducted for another 12 providers after concerns had been raised about their care. In the absence of any documentation, we were unable to identify the types of reviews, if any, that were conducted for these 12 providers. We also found that the five selected VA medical centers did not always conduct reviews of providersâ clinical care in a timely manner. Specifically, of the 148 providers, the VA medical centers did not initiate reviews of 16 providers for 3 months, and in some cases, for multiple years, after concerns had been raised about the providersâ care. In a few of these cases, additional concerns about the providersâ clinical care were raised before the reviews began. We found that two factors were largely responsible for the inadequate documentation and untimely reviews of providersâ clinical care we identified at the selected VA medical centers. First, VHA policy does not require VA medical centers to document all types of reviews of providersâ clinical care, including retrospective reviews, and VHA has not established a timeliness requirement for initiating reviews of providersâ clinical care. Second, VHAâs oversight of the reviews of providersâ clinical care is inadequate. Under VHA policy, networks are responsible for overseeing the credentialing and privileging processes at their respective VA medical centers. While reviews of providersâ clinical care after concerns are raised are a component of credentialing and privileging, we found that none of the network officials we spoke with described any routine oversight of such reviews. This may be in part because the standardized tool that VHA requires the networks to use during their routine audits does not direct network officials to ensure that all reviews of providersâ clinical care have been conducted and documented. Further, some of the VISN officials we interviewed told us they were not using the standardized audit tool as required. Without adequate documentation and timely completion of reviews of providersâ clinical care, VA medical center officials lack the information they need to make decisions about providersâ privileges, including whether or not to take adverse privileging actions against providers. Furthermore, because of its inadequate oversight, VHA lacks reasonable assurance that VA medical center officials are reviewing all providers about whom clinical care concerns have been raised and are taking adverse privileging actions against the providers when appropriate. To address these shortcomings, we recommended that VHA 1) require documentation of all reviews of providersâ clinical care after concerns have been raised, 2) establish a timeliness requirement for initiating such reviews, and 3) strengthen its oversight by requiring networks to oversee VA medical centers to ensure that such reviews are documented and initiated in a timely manner. VA concurred with these recommendations and described plans for VHA to revise existing policy and update the standardized audit tool used by the networks to include more comprehensive oversight of VA medical centersâ reviews of providersâ clinical care after concerns have been raised. We found that from October 2013 through March 2017, the five VA medical centers we reviewed had only reported one of nine providers required to be reported to the NPDB under VHA policy. These nine providers either had adverse privileging actions taken against them or resigned or retired while under investigation before an adverse privileging action could be taken. None of these nine providers were reported to state licensing boards as required by VHA policy. The VA medical centers documented that these nine providers had significant clinical deficiencies that sometimes resulted in adverse outcomes for veterans. For example, the documentation shows that one providerâs surgical incompetence resulted in numerous repeat surgeries for veterans. Another providerâs opportunity to improve through an FPPE for cause had to be halted and the provider was removed from providing care after only a week due to concerns that continuing the review would potentially harm patients. In addition to these nine providers, one VA medical center terminated the services of four contract providers based on deficiencies in the providersâ clinical performance, but the facility did not follow any of the required steps for reporting providers to the NPDB or relevant state licensing boards. This is concerning, given that the VA medical center documented that one of these providers was terminated for cause related to patient abuse after only 2 weeks of work at the facility. Two of the five VA medical centers we reviewed each reported one provider to the state licensing boards for failing to meet generally accepted standards of clinical practice to the point that it raised concerns for the safety of veterans. However, we found that the medical centersâ reporting to the state licensing board took over 500 days to complete in both cases, which was significantly longer than the 100 days suggested in VHA policy. Across the five VA medical centers, we found that providers were not reported to the NPDB and state licensing boards as required for two reasons. First, VA medical center officials were generally not familiar with or misinterpreted VHA policies related to NPDB and state licensing board reporting. For example, at one VA medical center, we found that officials failed to report six providers to the NPDB because they were unaware that they had been delegated responsibility for NPDB reporting. Officials at two other VA medical centers incorrectly told us that VHA cannot report contract providers to the NDPB. At another VA medical facility, officials did not report a provider to the NPDB or to any of the state licensing boards where the provider held a medical license because medical center officials learned that one state licensing board had already found out about the issue independently. Therefore, VA officials did not believe that they needed to report the provider. This misinterpretation of VHA policy meant that the NPDB and the state licensing boards in other states where the provider held licenses were not alerted to concerns about the providerâs clinical practice. Second, VHA policy does not require the networks to oversee whether VA medical centers are reporting providers to the NPDB or state licensing boards when warranted. We found, for example, that network officials were unaware of situations in which VA medical center officials failed to report providers to the NPDB. We concluded that VHA lacks reasonable assurance that all providers who should be reported to these entities are reported. VHAâs failure to report providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards as required facilitates providers who provide substandard care at one facility obtaining privileges at another VA medical center or at hospitals outside of VAâs health care system. We found several cases of this occurring among the providers who were not reported to the NPDB or state licensing boards by the five VA medical centers we reviewed. For example, we found that two of the four contract providers whose contracts were terminated for clinical deficiencies remained eligible to provide care to veterans outside of that VA medical center. At the time of our review, one of these providers held privileges at another VA medical center, and another participated in the network of providers that can provide care for veterans in the community. We also found that a provider who was not reported as required to the NPDB during the period we reviewed had their privileges revoked 2 years later by a non-VA hospital in the same city for the same reason the provider was under investigation at the VA medical center. Officials at this VA medical center did not report this provider following a settlement agreement under which the provider agreed to resign. A committee within the VA medical center had recommended that the providerâs privileges be revoked prior to the agreement. There was no documentation of the reasons why this provider was not reported to the NPDB under VHA policy. To improve VA medical centersâ reporting of providers to the NPDB and state licensing boards and VHA oversight of these processes, we recommended that VHA require its networks to establish a process for overseeing VA medical centers to ensure they are reporting to the NPDB and to state licensing boards and to ensure that this reporting is timely. VA concurred with this recommendation and told us that it plans to include oversight of timely reporting to the NPDB and state licensing boards as part of the standard audit tool used by the networks.

Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nLynne Neagle AM: Good afternoon. Can I welcome Members to the virtual meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee this afternoon? In accordance with Standing Order 34.19, I've determined that the public are excluded from the committee's meeting, in order to protect public health. In accordance with Standing Order 34.21, notice of this decision was included in the agenda for this meeting, which was published last Thursday. This meeting is, however, being broadcast live on Senedd.tv, with all participants joining via video-conference. A record of proceedings will be published as usual. Aside from the procedural adaptation related to conducting proceedings remotely, all other Standing Order requirements for committees remain in place. The meeting is bilingual, and simultaneous translation from Welsh to English is available. Can I remind everyone that the microphones will be controlled centrally, so there's no need to turn them on and off individually? We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David AM, and there is no substitution. Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay, thank you. Can I just note for the record that if for any reason I drop out of the meeting, the committee has agreed that Dawn Bowden AM will temporarily chair while I try to rejoin? Moving on, then, to item 2 this afternoon, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government in relation to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on health and social services as they relate to children and young people in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Vaughan Gething AM, the Minister for Health and Social Services; Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Albert Heaney, deputy director general of the health and social services group; Nicola Edwards, deputy director, childcare, play and early years; Jean White, chief nursing officer; and Tracey Breheny, who is deputy director of mental health, substance misuse and vulnerable groups. Thank you all very much for your attendance todayâwe appreciate your time. We've got lots of questions that we'd like to cover, which we'll go straight into, with questions from SiÃ¢n Gwenllian.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Good afternoon. How much do we understand about how this virus impacts children and young people, and their role in transmitting the virus? And how important is it that this is considered in the Welsh Government's exit strategy, especially in the context of reopening schools?\nVaughan Gething AM: Okay. I think it's fair to say that our understanding is developing across all age ranges about the virus and its impact. It's still the case that children and young people are less likely to be affected significantly by COVID-19 than people with a range of healthcare conditions, and in particular the age grade that we've seen, and that's underpinned the advice we've given to the whole population about self-isolation by people in age categories, as well as the extremely vulnerable group we advise to shield. We still don't understand everything about the role that children have to play in the transmitting of the virus, and this is one of the difficulties we face. Because in cold and flu, children transmit the virus and they're also susceptible, in particular to the flu, as well; that's why we have a childhood immunisation programme for the flu as well. We do know that there's some developing evidence about what's called a Kawasaki-like syndrome, but that's affecting very small numbers of children. We have one possible case in Walesâa child who's in critical careâbut that isn't confirmed. That's still a developing knowledge base. So, the rest of the world is still trying to understand that too. But the generals still applyâthat children are less likely to be affected than older people, but can nevertheless still become unwell, and that's, if you like, one of the few positives in this condition. But as I say, we're still learning, so I won't try and present a fully accurate or finalised picture of knowledge in this area.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And in termsâ[Inaudible.]\nVaughan Gething AM: Chair. Sorry. Excuse me, Chair. Sorryâwith apologies to the Member, my translation stopped after a while, so I heard the first part translated, and then it just fell off. I'm really sorry, but I didn't want to try to answer a different question to the one that may be being asked, and don't think that's fair to the Member or other members of the committee.\nLynne Neagle AM: Can we check that translation is back on, please, and maybe SiÃ¢n could repeat her question?\nVaughan Gething AM: I can hear it, yes.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, SiÃ¢n, would you mind repeating that, please?\nSian Gwenllian AM: Not at all. I was discussing NHS services, including critical care services, and I was asking whether there is sufficient capacity in place to manage any increase. We, of course, hope that there won't be any increase, but should there be an increase, particularly in paediatric cases of coronavirusâlet's say such a thing were to happen and this rare syndrome that you mentioned did emerge here in Walesâdo we have the capacity in place to deal with these, and with the impact of coronavirus more generally on children?\nVaughan Gething AM: At this point in time, the answer is 'yes', and there is always a significant caveat, though, and the 'but' that comes in there is that despite the fact that we've got a plan for surge capacity in paediatric careâ. So, when we increased critical care right across the national health service, we of course looked at paediatric care as part of that as well. So, we can flex up our capacity. But the challenge in all of that this isâit's part of my caution and the Government's caution about moves out of lockdown. So, it's much easier to go into lockdown than to come out of it, and I know you heard evidence from the Minister for Education last week about the approach that she wants to take and the principles behind doing that. So, actually, we'll need to think carefully about if we are reopening schools, even on a limited basis, what that then does to the circulation of coronavirus within that group of children as well as within the wider community, and then to try to understand whether the current capacity we have planned for in surge capacity is still going to be enough, because, actually, one of the real success stories of the first stage of the fight with coronavirus is that we haven't had our critical care capacity filled up. It's been extended, and the extension has meant that we haven't been overtopped.Â If we hadn't done that, we definitely would have been. And we'll need to carry on testing ourselves and seeing what's happening and looking at the evidence and making sure that the plan we already have got that we published for paediatric critical care is still fit for purpose, and again to reconsider if we need to do things differently. But that's part of the difficulty of being a Minister at the momentâyou don't know everything that's coming, and on this disease in particular, we do know that we're still learning with each passing day.\nLynne Neagle AM: [Inaudible.]âSiÃ¢n?\nSian Gwenllian AM: Hello. Yes, those are the questions I had on that section.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay. Lovely. Thank you very much. Right, we'll move on now then to some question on access to health services from Dawn Bowden.\nDawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair. Minister, just some concern that you will have heard about in terms of parents and carers maybe not taking their children into the healthcare system for other conditions while the coronavirus pandemic is with us. How are you monitoring that situation at the moment and have you had to look at your own commutation strategy in relation to that?\nVaughan Gething AM: We've had to look at some specifics around communication, so challenges about not just different languages, but about how we get messages to people in a very different environment, and it's really challenging. So, for example, our health visitor service has absolutely not stopped. We've had to think about the way it works, and I had this conversation earlier this week with the chief nurse. But the bigger challenge are parents refusing to engage with the service. I understand people's fear and anxiety, but that then means that their family, and in particular their child, isn't getting the sort of proactive care that we would want them to have. So, there's a real concern both at the professional leadership end and for the chief nurse and for Ministers as well about how we can get through. That's actually about rebuilding people's confidence in the service, and that isn't straightforward because there's a broader concern about coronavirus still circulating. But I think for us it's really important to reiterate that we have thought again about how to provide the service. We've thought about how to protect staff and families and the very clear message to parents is to please make sure that when health and care professionals are calling to help and support your family, please discuss your concerns with them. We're doing even more remotely, via telephone and online as well. There are times you need to be physically in the same place, for example on routine vaccinations, because we certainly haven't stopped that programme either, and I really wouldn't want to see that one of the unintended consequences of what we've done is that if parents don't engage with that service, we could potentially see a rise in other diseases. We're all, I thinkânot just youÂ in your constituency, but others who are on this call andÂ others as wellâseeing an occasional reappearance of measles, and that's because people didn't engage with the vaccination programme. I don't want, either myself or a different health Minister in the future, to be sat here talking about how in years to come the failure to engage in a vaccination programme has led to clearly avoidable but significant harm to children and young people and the communities they live in.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Jean, you wanted to come in.\nVaughan Gething AM: You need to unmute yourself. Oh, noâ\nProfessor Jean White: Thank you. I just want to add to what the Minister said. So, I approached the immunisation lead in Public Health Wales to see exactly what has been happening recently and they said at the very beginning of the outbreak parents were very reluctant about coming forward for their routine immunisations, but recently, through lots of energy from the immunisation clinics and the leads within it reaching out to families, that trend seems to have turned and there's now a much better attendance. One of the most important things we can do to protect our children is to make sure they have their vaccinations. So, yes, there was a bit of a downturn, but it does seem to be improving at the moment. Thank you.\nDawn Bowden AM: Okay, thank you. And that answered my second question, Chair, so I'm happy to leave it there. Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you very much. We're going to go on now to some questions about mental health from SiÃ¢n Gwenllian. SiÃ¢n.\nSian Gwenllian AM: It's a cause of great concern to us all, of course, in terms of the impact of this crisis on mental health and well-being among our children and young people. So, what assessment has the Government undertaken of the impact on these aspects in young people and what work is being done to understand the impact of the pandemic? What longer term measures will be put in place and what support services will be put in place?\nVaughan Gething AM: Again, I think it's helpful that you've already heard from the education Minister last week, because I think the first of her key principles for returning to school is the impact on the emotional health and well-being of children. So, children's mental health was a central concern and remains so for both myself and the education Minister. Part of the honest challenge, again, is that we don't fully understand the impact on the mental health and well-being of children but we do expect there will have been an impact. So, we're working together with both health boards and our own knowledge and analytical services across the Government to both try to further understand what that is and the difference. Until we have more contact with families, we may not fully understand that, and that's a real point of concern for me. In all of the unknowns within this, the impact on mental health and well-being is absolutely one of them, because we're looking at how we then develop not just a recovery plan for the economy but a recovery plan around mental health, how we support people, and that will have to be informed by the understanding of what's happening when we get more engagement with families about the level of need, and then how we need to think about that. Obviously, it's a key factor for their return to school, but, actually, for the life children and young people lead outside the school environment, and that will be difficult because we're going to phase out of lockdownâit's not going to be a one-hit measure. That absolutely isn't going to happen. We're going to be looking at, at each point, what difference has been made, what more we can do. And, again, there are the efforts we're making to make sure that our online support services and our telephone support servicesâthat we keep on reminding people that they're there and are available, and we want people to make use of them, because I know, as this committee said, we'd much rather be able to support people and intervene earlier rather than wait until there's a much bigger problem in a period of months in the future.\nSian Gwenllian AM: So, in reality, there's been no assessment undertaken because it's difficult to do that. So, the full picture in terms of the outcomes of the crisisâyou don't know what they are at the moment as things stand.\nVaughan Gething AM: We can't know, because we don't have that level of contact. There is a developmentâ. I wouldn't say that no work's being done, but I couldn't tell you honestly that that work is finalised and we have a definitive understanding of the picture. If I tried to say that, then I'm sure you'd ask me, 'How on earth can you say that? If you're not having regular contact with people, you can't possibly understand the picture.' And it's much better to say, 'We don't understand the full picture. We know there'll have been an impact. We're working alongside health boards and others, but we'll know more as we carry on having more contact with families.' I'll look at a variety of different areas, again, both to reform the recovery plan, but also then to understand what we need to do at various points in the future, and the picture that we're seeing isn't straightforward and we need to make sure that we don't try to pretend to ourselves or to the public that there is a one-off measure that will allow us to be successful in all the areas that we'd want to be.\nSian Gwenllian AM: But can you give the committee an assurance today that this area of mental health and well-being is going to be a priority for you as health Minister?\nVaughan Gething AM: Of course. Not just on the work we've done in the past; not just because it's one of the key principles for the education Minister about the reopening of schools, but it is a real worry list for me about how we understand the impact on the mental health and well-being of children and young people, and to move forwards, that we don't end up with an entire generation of children and young people who grow up with a range of damage because we haven't thought about what that will look like. So, the mental health recovery plan will of course be of very real importance to me. In amongst all the other priorities I have, I'm certainly not going to allow the mental health and well-being of children and young people to be forgotten.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And how does the current capacity in terms of child and adolescent mental health services compare to service capacity prior to the coronavirus outbreak in Wales? Have you had to shift some resources over from CAMHS, for example, in order to deal with more general aspects of coronavirus?\nVaughan Gething AM: No, we've actually gotâ. Maybe perhaps it might be helpful, Chair, if Tracey Breheny could say something about the way that we're monitoring the impact we have, in terms of we've got a reporting tool, but also weekly contact with leads in CAMHS services.\nLynne Neagle AM: Tracey.\nTracey Breheny: Of course. Thanks, Minister. Yes, on that question, we moved pretty quickly at the beginning of the pandemic phase to put in place, as the Minister said, a weekly monitoring tool of all local health boards, so through that tool, we look at that every week in terms of collecting information. Whilst national reporting's been stood down, we are picking up assurance through that tool on things like staff sickness in CAMHS services, referral numbers and so on, so we do have that tool in place, and at the moment, that's telling us that the system can meet the capacity; has the capacity to meet need.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Have CAMHS staff been shifted over to do other work during this virus outbreak?\nTracey Breheny: There has been some movement, as I'm saying, around health boards, particularly where in the first phase of the epidemic the concentration was on in-patient provision, providing critical care, but my understanding is from the latest tool that we looked at last week, those staff are gradually not just returning to work from self-isolation or whatever, or from different parts of the system.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And then, what about the capacity for CAMHS primary mental health services? Has there been a reduction in that capacity since the beginning of the pandemic in terms of in-patients? Because that's what I'm hearing, that there has been such a reduction, but how are those patients then treated and served?\nTracey Breheny: In terms of in-patient capacity, that is in the system in both the north Wales and in the south Wales unit at the moment. There were some discharges of young people, but we've had the assurance that that was only undertaken where it was clinically safe to do so and where the community support was in place.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And finally in this section from me, given that schools are of course closed and that schools are so very important in terms of signposting young people towards services, how can young people access appropriate servicesâonline services, for example? How are they signposted towards those services at the moment?\nVaughan Gething AM: Well, we've not closed off general practice and, as you know, we've expanded the ability for people to access services in an online manner. We've expanded a range of telephone advice services, so the telephone advice service we already provide, we've made sure that's maintained, and both myself and the deputy Minister have referred to that on a number of occasions. I think the real struggle and the real difficulty is actually how you punch through different messages when the broader news agenda is so overwhelmingly focused on headline messages in other areas. That is, again, a worry for me, but the communications we have within the health and care system, people should know where to refer people to and how to provide access to both telephone and online support that continues to be available, and actually, as I say, we've expanded that right across our healthcare system. That's what Iâm keen to see continue into the future. Whatever the post-COVID-19 world is, I don't want to miss out on the progress we have made in the online provision of services. Of course, most children and young people expect to be able to access services in an online manner already.\nSian Gwenllian AM: But, of course, there will be some who are missed; they may fall between two stools because they wonât know where to turn.\nVaughan Gething AM: Yes, and that, again, comes back to our challenge of how we help children and young people in their context, with their families, to know where support and advice and guidance is. Many people are defaulting to their general practitioner if they can't find advice somewhere else, so that's why there's the information we're providing through general practice to signpost people, so those pathways havenât been closed off. It's about making sure that people have alternative means that theyâre prepared to use at this point in time. If we go back to where we started this evidence session, we were talking about the difficulty of families who don't want to engage in a traditional person-to-person contact or being in the same room as someone else or allowing people into their home. So, there's a real challenge about how we make the service available, but then encourage people to take it up, so that we donât see much greater harm that we have to try and resolve at a later point.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. I've got a supplementary from Suzy Davies, and can I remind Ministers about concise answers, please? Suzy.\nSuzy Davies AM: Yes, thank you. Just as we're speaking about children and young people's mental health, I wonder if you can confirm whether you've seen the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child's reports about what they call the grave physical and psychological effect on children and young people, and whether the operational guidance you've given out is responding to that in any way, or maybe there was something in that that you hadnât thought of and you can respond to as we go along.\nVaughan Gething AM: I, personally, haven't read that advice, but the Government's already concerned about the direct physical and mental health impact of lockdown restrictions. You don't need to be a parent to recognise that thatâs a potential issue for children and young people. But, I'm sureâ. I haven't read it, but that's been signposted, so I can check with officials if they have and if that would change the advice and the position that we're already adopting, because we do regularly look at a range of advice from a range of sources, including the UN, the World Health Organization and others.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, and we are going to come onto children's rights. But, as you know, Minister, the prevention of young suicide is a cause that is very close to my heart. Can I ask what assessment the Welsh Government has made of an increase in suicide amongst children and young people during this pandemic and because of this pandemic?\nVaughan Gething AM: Apart from the general concern that I've expressed on mental health generally, we are already investigating, we're having aâ. We've commissioned, through the Government, the delivery unit to work with the national advisory group, including Dr Ann John and other people, to review the current, unexpected deaths during the start of the pandemic here in Wales, because we want to try to understand the wider concerns about the potential effects of the restrictions on the mental health and well-being of children and young people, and if that is leading to a spike in suicide or not. So, that's why we've commissioned that review to be carried out with the current numbers of unexpected deaths that we have, so we're able then to provide a report to understand where we are. My understanding is that we should have a report on that review before the end of this month and, obviously, I know the committeeâs got an interest, so if it's helpful we can write to you once we've had a chance to receive the report and to look at it.\nLynne Neagle AM: Yes, please. Thank you. In terms of provision of crisis care, then, how has that been impacted by the pandemic? Are those crisis services available for children and young people who need them at the moment?\nVaughan Gething AM: Yes, they continue to be available. We still have seven-day-a-week crisis care. We've made clear that mental health services, including those for children and young people, are essential services to be provided. They're not services to be scaled down. They were not part of the series of measures that I stopped within the health service on 13 March. We have built up those crisis care services over a period of time, and the last thing we want to see is to see them disappear during this period of time when there are well-understood concerns about emotional and mental health.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you. Moving on to perinatal mental health, this morning I hosted a round-table with the NSPCC where we heard about lots of good practice that's going on in terms of supporting new mothers and their families in this period, but I wonder if you can tell the committee what you are doing as a Government to make sure that there is consistent perinatal support for all women across Wales in what is a difficult time for any new mother, let alone in a pandemic.\nVaughan Gething AM: We continue, again, to provide our perinatal mental health service. That's not been stopped either. We've also been looking at how that's provided on a phone or online basis where possible, because again the same concerns exist about physical contact with people. So, we're looking to make sure that the progress isn't lost that we've made. We know there is more to go. So, the service may have changed, but it still absolutely exists. And again, part of the challenge in all of this is about the pause or the interruption in work to create the in-patient capacity that I've previously committed to. So, I want to understand what that really means, but again the problem is, at this point in the pandemic, I can't give you an answer about what that means for that in-patient provision. We're still committed to it, but I'm concerned about the time frameâthat is partly about the length and the extent. But again, I'm really impressed by the continuing commitment of our staff to deliver this service for women in what is a particularly uncertain time. It's difficult enough in terms of the challenge in terms of perinatal mental health in normal times, about people being prepared to come forward and then receiving the sort of response they'd want, and even more so now.\nLynne Neagle AM: Is the Welsh Government aware that there's apparently been a decrease in the numbers of women being willing to look at mother and baby unit provision, and will you be taking that into account in your planning? Because, obviously, we wouldn't want people to think that was because of a lack of need; it's down to fear and the lockdown.\nVaughan Gething AM: Yes, we're aware there's been a reduction in people wanting to make use of the serviceâor being prepared to make use of the service is probably a better phraseâbecause we know that's the same with a range of other areas. There aren't fewer people having strokes than there were at this period of time last year; the reason why the figures are different is the way that people are behaving because of their concerns about coronavirus. So, I certainly wouldn't be using this period of time to plan for the need that exists for a facility that we want to create. So, I'm happy to give that assurance, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. The next questions are from Suzy Davies.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. It's a straightforward one, really. Obviously, we have the detail of the third sector resilience fund and theâthere are two funds, aren't there, for third sector organisations? But can you give us some indication of how much of that support is being targeted to children and young people, and perhaps you can specifically mention how much of the Â£6.3 million for hospices is for children's hospices? I don't mind who answers that one.\nLynne Neagle AM: The Deputy Minister would like to come in, I think.\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes. Certainly, I'm sure the committee is aware, as Suzy has said, of the funds that are available for third sector services. The Deputy Minister and the Chief Whip, of course, announced on 6 April the Â£24 million Welsh Government third sector COVID-19 response fund, and that of course is more than we would have had as a result of consequentials from the UK Government. They can also benefit from the Â£400 million economic resilience fund, but I am aware that some groups don't benefit from that and they may not qualify for that. So, we've also got third sector support being delivered by WCVA, such as the voluntary services emergency fund, which supports volunteering, and the third sector resilience fund, supporting organisations to stay afloat. We are working very closely with the third sector on issues such as support for fostering services, care leavers and repurposing funding so that they can support the crises. Voices from Care Cymru has developed a specific offer for care leavers, and the Fostering Network provides extended helplines. We've got lots of examples of third sector partners working with children and young people. Childline bases in Wales remain open and operational, and are still providing information and support. And, actually, about 50 per cent of contact with Childline at the moment is to do with COVID-19. NSPCC has put together a support page for young people about COVID-19. The NSPCC UK helpline have also reported a decrease in calls resulting in a referral to children's social services at the start of the lockdown period, but, since then, the numbers have actually risen. So, there are lots of examples of help for children. Meic, Action for Children, and, of course, Voices From Care Cymru have come up with their own specific package. In terms of the actual percentage that is being spent on children, I can't give you an actual figure for that, but, certainly, there are a whole range of projects that are there helping children. I think the Minister for Health and Social Services will be able to respond to the hospice question.\nVaughan Gething AM: It's about Â£1.5 million from the Â£6.3 million that's gone to TÅ· Gobaith and TÅ· Hafan, Suzy.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you very much for that. So, it's about 25 per cent. Perhaps if you could ask the Deputy Minister, when she's in a position to do so, to let us have a note. Before we finish on this point, could I ask the Deputy Minister, again, about whether any of the things you've been talking about now is additional money, because, obviously, you mentioned yourself one of these funds is Â£24 million. Some of the work you mentioned is continuity of existing work. So, again, if you don't have the answer to hand, perhaps you could send us a note in due course about how much extra is going in.\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes. I think most of those things I mentioned are things that are already there, and the Â£24 million is for support and extra help. So, any more information, I can send to you.\nSuzy Davies AM: Lovely. Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you very much. The next questions, then, are from Dawn Bowden on safeguarding and child protection.\nDawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Chair, and thank you, Deputy Minister, because one of the questions I was going to ask was around some of the work that you've been doing with the third sector on safeguarding and child protection, and I think you've covered that. But what I'm particularly keen to find out is how you're monitoring the impact of coronavirus on child protection and safeguarding in the round. I know the health Minister raised this as a concern in Plenary only recently, and it's really how we are monitoring it, what concerns have been identified, and how we're going to start to tackle some of those.\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes. Thank you very much, Dawn, for that question. Obviously, it is difficult to monitor if there's not easy access to the children that we're referring to, and that's why we have been trying to encourage the vulnerable children to go into school or childcare settings. And there's been a lot of encouragement for that happen. The Minister, the director of education and the director of social services sent out a joint letter recently to all the local authorities, asking them to try to encourage the vulnerable children and the families to get the children to go to school. In fact, we've now got 890 vulnerable children attending school settings, and that's the highest number that we've had at all since the opening of the scheme. But it's still only a tiny drop in the ocean. But it's very good, and it is progress that the numbers attending are now going up. But, of course, there are a lot of children who are not attending school and the social services are not necessarily seeing. There has been a drop in safeguarding referrals to social services. Those numbers are now beginning to go up, but there certainly was a significant drop, which is a great deal of concern. One local authority, in fact, reported a drop of 27 per cent in terms of safeguarding referrals compared to this time last year. So, I issued a written statement on 1 May, setting out the work taken forward under our cross-departmental vulnerable children, young people and safeguarding work stream, and encouraging people to report any safeguarding concerns there are. Because, obviously, we are dependent on the public authoritiesâyou know, schools and health servicesâto report any concerns, and at the moment, obviously, they're not there to report them. So, we have made this public appeal for everyone to look out for each other, and I was very interested in what SiÃ¢n Gwenllian told me about what was being done in Anglesey in terms of sending out a message via social media to get people to look and listen, and to raise their concerns, because, obviously, safeguarding is the concern of everybody in the community. But I think that we are reassured in terms of our contact with the local authorities that they are, in fact, keeping close touch, as far as they possibly can, with all the children that are vulnerable. For those where it is very critical, face-to-face contact is still taking place, and there are imaginative ways of trying to keep in touch with all the other children and families. So, it is a difficult situation and we are concerned about it, but I think as much as possible is being done.\nLynne Neagle AM: Jean, you wanted to come in on that.\nProfessor Jean White: Just to add to what the Deputy Minister was saying, the health visiting service has not been stopped or stepped back. It has consolidated some of the ways that it does the Healthy Child Wales Programme, but, for those families that are identified as having particular need or have children that are particularly vulnerable, all the normal contacts have been maintained, so they're not unseen to the normal health visiting service. That covers both Flying Start and general health visiting areas. Thank you.\nDawn Bowden AM: Thank you, Jean, for that, and, Deputy Minister, would there be any value at this point in actually revisiting the current Welsh Government definition and guidance around vulnerable children, in terms of who we identify as vulnerable? Because this opens up a whole new group of children that are not necessarily known to services but can still be vulnerable. So,it's just looking at the current guidance that we have. Do you think that needs revisiting at all?\nJulie Morgan AM: The definition of vulnerable children and young people includes those with a social worker and with statements of special educational needs, and the most vulnerable of these should be prioritised. But we have now looked at this again, and we've set out an expanded definition, and we intend to publish that this week. This does include discretion for local authorities to have some flexibility and to be able to offer a place for those who may be on the edge of receiving care and support if they are known to be vulnerable by the school or by family support services. Because, obviously, the children that we know about, we know about, but there are those other children who may be on the edge of careâthe children that we've been trying very hard, as part of our policies in the Welsh Government, to keep with their families, with a lot of support. Those are the ones that we also want to support. So, we are giving discretion to the local authorities in order to have a degree of flexibility, and that will be published this week.\nDawn Bowden AM: Thank you. Thank you, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. We're going to move on now, then, to talk about looked-after children and children on the edge of care, with questions from Janet Finch-Saunders.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you, Chair. Can you set out the impact the coronavirus emergency has had on the care system, including edge-of-care services, and where have there been areas of concern?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, local authorities have obviously had to change their working practices in response to the COVID emergency, so a red-amber-green ratingÂ risk assessment was adopted by all local authorities at the start of the pandemic to ensure that vulnerable children and families receive the right way of receiving services and the frequency of contact from the services. This is being dealt with on a case-by-case basis, so every case that is known is being RAG rated and services are being linked to that. Also, there is very close contact between Welsh Government officials and the local authorities. There are weekly meetings between officials and the heads of the children's services. I can't speak too highly, really, about the amount of support and mutual work that has been going on. We've been assured that there have been no significant increases in the numbers of looked-after children, and the number of placement breaks are minimal. The other interesting good point is the children services workforce remains at 90 per cent plus, and, obviously, that is a great testimony to the dedication of the workforce. So, there's very close contact. The children are all being monitored individually, and I think in the circumstances we're all doing what we possibly can. I know that Albert Heaney is able, probably, to respond in more detail to the contacts, if you'd like to have that.\nLynne Neagle AM: I think we'll move on to the next section. Can I remind everyone again: sharp focused questions and concise answers? Janet.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Thanks. How is Welsh Government ensuring that vulnerable children have access to the necessary technology to maintain contact with their social workers and other support workers and networks?\nJulie Morgan AM: It is normal practice to ensure that children and families do have appropriate access to technology to keep in touch with social workers, so that is part of our normal practice. We're very keen as a Welsh Government that no children are left behind in their education during this period. So, last month, as you will know, the Minister for Education announced Â£3 million of funding to help digitally excluded learners so that they've got access to the internet, so that they can fully participate in online learning. So, we do normally ensure that they've got digital contact for social workers.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you. Can you set out the picture regarding children's residential care? What are the challenges these care settings are facing, and have any children's homes closed?\nJulie Morgan AM: Residential children's homes are not really reporting any particularly difficult issues, and certainly they have been able to resolve any issues that have happened. So, I'm very pleased to report that. We obviously expect all children in residential care to be supported, and to keep contact with their families and with their siblings, and that is going on, although it may be by technology rather than face to face. We know that some young people have found the social distancing a challenge, and I think itâs easy for us to understand that they have found that quite difficult. So, there have been a few issues related to that, but, where that has happened, local authorities have been able to resolve that on a case-by-case basis, and really there are not any major issues. In terms of residential care, Hillside is functioning wellâno reporting issues. The staffing levels are normal. There are fewer children and young people there, so, in fact, there's been an opportunity to give a great deal of attention to the children, and I think we've had very good reports about how that has happened. So, I am absolutely reassured by our officials here that everything is as well as it could be. I also meet with the children's commissioner once a week, who is an independent source, and she said when I met her last week, 'Well, as far as we know, it's all good news'. So, I don't think we have any concerns at the moment about the residential care.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Okay. Moving on to foster care, how is Welsh Government working with local authorities to meet the challenges set out by the Association of Fostering and Adoption Cymru and its fostering guidelines?\nJulie Morgan AM: We have worked with the fostering organisations. We have had close communications with them, and we've supported AFA Cymru to develop guidance for foster carers, and that guidance has been very strongly welcomed across the sector. We're working with the third sector. I think I mentioned before specific issues such as support for fostering services and, of course, care leavers. The Fostering Network has extended its helpline hours, and, of course, Voices from CareâI mentioned them beforeâhave developed this particular offer of support for care leavers. I've been reassured, as well, from Voices from Care that the young people appear to be more stable nowâthat they have contact with. But that's online help for them. So, we have had quite a lot of contact with the fostering services.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: So, the final point on that, then: the Fostering Network and others, as you know, have called for foster parents who can temporarily no longer foster due to the current virus emergency to be paid a retainer, with all foster carers receiving extra financial support for additional expenses. What is your position on this, please?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, we haven't had any specific representations from local authorities asking for support for foster carers, but some local authorities have paid retainers and some people, I believe, have increased the amount of money that they are paying. They've also given support for various activities and thingsâhave helped sometimes, I think, with broadband access and that sort of issue. And, obviously, foster carers who do require additional support should be approaching their local authorities or the independent fostering agency.\nJanet Finch-Saunders AM: Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you. Albert, I just wanted to check there wasn't anything you wanted to add, please.\nAlbert Heaney: Thank you very much, Chair. I think the only thing to add was relating to monitoring. The Minister has indicated that we are speaking weekly with heads of children's services, and we do now have a data collection that's been implemented to capture the critical data in relation to the children's services. So, that will assist us in our monitoring arrangements going forward. Thank you, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay. Thank you very much. And the next questions, then, are from Suzy Davies.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you, Chair. I just wanted to have a quick answer from probably the Minister, I think, about the primary legislation and the regulations that followed, about which children's rights impact assessments have been done. Have any been done, and can they be shared with the committee if they have? Sorry, Deputy Ministerâmy mistake.\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, it's been a very difficult time, as you appreciate, in terms of having to make legislation very quickly, and it hasn't been possible to do the impact assessments that we would normally do. However, I am very pleased to say that we're actually launching a survey of children. We're going to be launching it next week. And this is to try to get from children their views of what's happened, what we've been doing, and their views on the whole COVID-19 situation. So, we're doing this in conjunction with the children's commissioner and with Young Wales and with the Youth Parliament. So, this is an online survey that we hope will be going out to thousands of children, and we will get their response in terms of what are the important issues that have arisen for them, what they feel about what's happened during this period, what they feel about the way that we've dealt with the schools, the way that they've had to cope in not going school and being at home for so long. And so we're trying to get feedback from young people. So, I'm very pleased that we're doing that, but, in terms of an impact assessment, it has been very difficult, as I'm sure you can imagine, to be able to do those at these times. I think that Albert wants to come in on that.\nSuzy Davies AM: Yes, because I'll pursue that in a sec.\nLynne Neagle AM: Albert.\nAlbert Heaney: Thank you. Thank you, Chair, and I think Nicola indicated before me, so apologies, Nicola. Just to say for the committee, really importantly, that we haven't introduced any easements in relation to children's services legislation. I think that's really quite crucial. So, from a Welsh context, the standards that are in place do remain, so therefore there wouldn't have been a necessity for us to do a children's rights impact assessment in relation to the primary legislation. I think that's particularly a strong point to us in Wales, both in terms of safeguarding arrangements, but also ensuring that children's rights are protected at a crucial time.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Nicola.\nNicola Edwards: Thanks. In terms of childcare and education, we're obviously looking at the provisions under the coronavirus Act to allow us to maybe ease some of the statutory requirements, and we are going to be undertaking a full suite of impact assessments on those. Obviously, the coronavirus Act itself was UK Government legislation and they ran their own impact assessments, but, in terms of how we implement it in the childcare and education spaceâand I think Albert was just saying the same thingâwe definitely will be looking at those impacts in terms of going forward.\nSuzy Davies AM: Okay. Well, just to come back on that then, are you saying to me that, as a result of the various coronavirus regulations that we've had, no assessments for children's needs have been postponed, cancelled or done very quickly online rather than in person?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, I think, as Albert said, that there was no relaxation of regulation for children's social care. You know, that'sâthere haven't been any in Wales.\nSuzy Davies AM: No, but that's whatâ. There's no relaxation, but what's happening in practice? We're down on staff across all our councils and in our third sectorsâwho's doing the children's needs assessments, particularly for young carers?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, Iâ. Albert, can you answer that?\nAlbert Heaney: I think the first thing to say to the committee is that, going back, we took a very strong line at the beginning that we weren't going to introduce easements in requirements to children's social services. Of course, through the way that practitioners and social work practitioners have to operate, they are having to operate through a different time. So, assessments are still taking place for child protection and safeguarding concerns; assessments are still taking place, and especially in relation toâas you mentionedâyoung carers, to support their needs. So, arrangementsâ[Inaudible.] But they're having to be slightly differently doneâso, some of the technology, and keeping in contact and keeping those visits. So, we've used, for example, the St David's Day fund to make sure that care leavers are well supported in terms of having contact and are accessible and able to engage as well. So, we're having to be a little bit moreâand social services departments are having to be a little bit moreâinnovative in the use of technology in the way that they've engaged as well. But personal visits are taking place, and visits especially, as the Minister mentioned earlier onâthey actually individually assess each case to determine the frequency of visits, to make sure that those contacts are maintained with children at a critical time.\nSuzy Davies AM: Okay. Thank you. I don't want to take this much further, but personal visits and social distancing could be slightly problematic. I just want to finish with this one question, if I may. We've had recommendations from the Carers Trust, or Carers Trust Wales. Have they been accepted by Government, and is it those that are driving the agenda of the task and finish group that you announced the other day, Deputy Minister?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, those will certainly be considered by the task and finish group. I've had a letter from the Carers Trust about those issues, and we are setting up this group, as you know, and we will be looking at those issues in the group.\nSuzy Davies AM: Okay. Thank you. Any steal on when that might report?\nJulie Morgan AM: I don't have that at the moment.\nSuzy Davies AM: Okay. Thank you.\nLynne Neagle AM: Maybe we could have a note on that, Deputy Minister. Can I just say, we are running short of time? We did start late, so, if the Ministers are happy, we'll carry on until 2.10 p.m.â3.10 p.m.âif that's okay. And the next questions are from SiÃ¢n Gwenllian.\nSian Gwenllian AM: [Inaudible.]\nLynne Neagle AM: Hold on a sec, SiÃ¢n, we've lost translation again. Can we just see what can be done to get the translation back? Sorry, SiÃ¢n. Is there anyone who can help with the translation? There you go, SiÃ¢n. Thank you.\nSian Gwenllian AM: You will know, Deputy Ministerâbecause we have discussed this in private sessionâmy major concerns with regard to the childcare sector, and what kind of childcare sector we will have at the end of this crisis, as families start to return to the workplace. There are still some childcare providers who are falling between the cracks and aren't receiving financial support. Do you agreeâare there people who are still not being supported, and why isn't the Welsh Government able to provide that support for everyone in the childcare sector?\nJulie Morgan AM: Thank you, SiÃ¢n, for that question. And I know that we have had a discussion about this before. Basically, we are aware that there are some sectors in the childcare sector that do fall through some of the loops. We have guaranteed that we will pay the money for the childcare offer for three months. So, that is guaranteed to them, and they are able to take advantage of the Government's job retainer scheme, but that does mean that there is a problem, as I think we've discussed before, of the double funding issue, and that is something that we have been trying to resolve and there have been discussions with the Treasury in Whitehall about ways forward on this. I'm going to ask Nicola to come in in a minute, because she's much more up to date with the discussions about that, but, so far, I don't think very much progress has been made on that. But we are looking to see if there are any other ways that we can get help to the childcare sector, and I'm actually following this meeting with a meeting with the Deputy Minister for equality and chief whip, who is responsible for the voluntary sector, because obviously many of the groups that we're talking about would come under the voluntary sector, because they have voluntary committees, but they fall between many stools, because they rent premises rather than own premises and they don't have high turnovers that would qualify them for some of these grants. So, perhaps I could ask Nicola to come in to expand on that.\nNicola Edwards: Absolutely.\nLynne Neagle AM: Briefly, if possible.\nNicola Edwards: I'll try and be brief, because I'm conscious of time. So, some childcare settings can access funding under the small business rate relief scheme, but certainly not all of them; some of them can access funding under the economic resilience fund, and, as the Deputy Minister said, we're following up for some of them to be able to access funding under the third sector resilience funding. All of the childcare settings can apply for the UK Government's coronavirus job retention scheme, but there are some complications around that in that it's a salary-based scheme and you can't claim two types of public funding for the same individual member of staff. So, if you were using funding under the childcare offer to pay for a particular member of staff's salary, you can't access CJRS and furlough that individual with Government money as well, and that has led to some confusion and complication about how that balances, which we're trying to work through with the sector and with local authorities around the rules and regulations that the Treasury and HMRC have put in place around that. Alongside that, there's a whole range of different loans and services that are available. Some of those are less attractive to some childcare settings, but they are still available and Business Wales is offering support and advice for settings on how they can help weather this storm and support their workers as best they can. We're also having some conversations now with our economy colleagues and with Business Wales about what happens next, the recovery and the return of the sector, and we've just come out of a meeting with the childcare sector around the support they think they would need to have in place to be able to return from this as well. So, it's a topic that's very much live at the moment.\nSian Gwenllian AM: I'm sure you can share my concerns and the concerns of Cwlwm, which represents the childcare sector and the nursery school sector, that there are a number of providers that aren't receiving support at all and are likely to collapse as a result of this. What I can't understand is why you, in collaboration with the Minister for the economy, Ken Skates, can't devise a specific grant package for the providers that aren't currently receiving support, or we'll be facing a situation that is very difficult when people are seeking childcare for their children and those settings won't be available to them. Why isn't it possible to have a bespoke scheme for those that are falling between the cracks in this sector?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, that is what we're looking to seeâif we can get a bespoke scheme. I absolutely agree with you: it is absolutely vital that we keep this sector going, because it is a fragile sector in any case, and I think about 50 per cent of the childcare settings have temporarily closed down and the reason they've given for closing down is because they haven't had enough children to make it viable to keep their settings going. So, it is a very worrying situation. They are heavily reliant on the fees that parents pay and, of course, with the social distancing and the lockdown, this has meant that we've had to discourage children from attending. So, that means the number of children they've had has been much reduced and it hasn't been viable for them to keep going, although obviously it's great that about half have stayed open so we have somewhere for the children of the critical workers and the vulnerable children to go. But, I absolutely agree with what you're saying, SiÃ¢n, and we are looking for a solution, because we know it's vital not only for the children and their parents, but for the economy as well, that we do have that sector there, surviving after this is all over. So, I can assure you, we're working very hard, and I think Nicola's working day and night to try to achieve this.\nSian Gwenllian AM: And just finally from me, I'm very pleased that you are working on this, and I very much hope that we will see a support package that will reach everyone in the sector, because it's been weeks now since all of this started, and if there's still no light at the end of the tunnel for some of them, then that needs to be dealt with. But just to conclude, how effective has the provision been in general over this period in terms of providing support for key workers?\nJulie Morgan AM: I think it's been crucial, because how would the majority of the key workers have been able to get to work and do all the wonderful things that they've been doing if it hadn't been for childcare for those who need it? And we were very pleased to introduce the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, which means that critical workers and families with vulnerable children are able to have free access to childcare aged 0 to 5, and I believe that we are the only country in the UK that is providing that free service to the vulnerable children, and soâ. I mean, that scheme has only really taken off now since Easter, so we don't have any particular statistics.\nNicola Edwards: I do have some early numbers, if you'd like me to announce them?\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes, that would be very good.\nLynne Neagle AM: Very briefly.\nNicola Edwards: Yes. In terms of the provision in schools, we're looking at around 4,000 children a day in schools at the moment. In terms of the children accessing the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, it has only been two weeks up and running really, so the numbers are quite low, but there were nearly 1,500 children accessing that childcare last week, and of those, just over 100 would fall within the definition of vulnerable children. So, it is picking up there; it was 900 children the week before that, so we are seeing some traction now that parents are aware that that support is there.\nSian Gwenllian AM: Okay, thank you very much.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. And, can I just ask, in terms of the other vulnerable children, what assurance can you give that all the vulnerable children who need to keep in contact with social workers and other key workers are being provided with the necessary technology to do that? Is that happening in a uniform way?\nJulie Morgan AM: Well, that is the intentionâthat everybody should have the opportunity to have the necessary technology, and certainly, that is what is intended.\nLynne Neagle AM: Thank you. Suzy, very, very briefly, one question on the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, please.\nSuzy Davies AM: Just generally, have you had any feedback on the effects on the family courts and the execution of theâwell, the child arrangement orders, the various versions of that?\nJulie Morgan AM: Yes. In terms of the family courts, as you probably know, a lot of the hearings are going on virtually, but the hearings that are more complex are being postponed to be heard at a later date. So, that's one of the issues, reallyâthat we may expect a lot of demand on the court service after this period has finished. And obviously, the president of the family division has issued guidance on compliance with family court child arrangement orders, which were his guidance, and obviously, this is directed at separated families subject to the family court, and that offers general advice to parents, recognising that the circumstances for each parent and each family will be different. And the Welsh Government has also provided guidance about staying at home and away from others. But of course, where parents have joint parental responsibility, as you know, the Government has said that children under 18 can be moved between the two households. With the other children, it's on a case-by-case basis, really, what actually happens. I have met with CAFCASS to see how their operations are going, and all the CAFCASS officials are not attending any courts at all; they're sending in any of their views virtually, but it appeared to be that there weren't any major issues arising.\nLynne Neagle AM: Okay, thank you, and we have definitely now come to the end of our time. So, can I thank the Ministers and officials for attending? We do recognise what an immensely pressurised time this is for Welsh Government, and we are very appreciative of having your time this afternoon, so thank you both to Ministers and officials. As usual, you will receive a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Diolch yn fawr.\nVaughan Gething AM: Diolch yn fawr, Chair.\nLynne Neagle AM: Item 3, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you very much. This is, of course, our last formal business of the National Assembly for Wales before we become the Senedd tomorrow, and it seems fitting that the National Assembly's last formal proceedings are focused on children and young people, and I'm sure that we would all agree that it is vital that they continue to be at the centre of the work of our Parliament going forward. We are now going to proceed in private.\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the whole meeting.\nAnswer:", "input_tokens": 10529}

Um {vocalsound} hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . The agenda for the meeting , I put it in the sh shared documents folder . I don't know if that meant that you could see it or not .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Did anyone ?\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: No .\nProject Manager: No . Oh well . Um I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there , there's a shared project documents folder . Um and it should be in there .\nUser Interface: Mm . Um um wi on on a what ? Oh project project documents , yeah , yeah , yeah , okay .\nProject Manager: Project documents , yeah . So I'll put it in there .\nUser Interface: Oh okay , yeah .\nProject Manager: Is it best if I send you an email maybe , to let you know it's there ?\nUser Interface: Yes , I think so .\nProject Manager: Yep . I'll do that next time . Um {vocalsound} I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I'll send them to you after the meeting . The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . I just sent\nUser Interface: Yeah , the last minute , yeah ,\nProject Manager: at the last minute , I'm sorry about that ,\nUser Interface: yeah .\nProject Manager: but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Um and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control {disfmarker} that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . And we've got forty minutes to do that in . So I would say {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: You said uh targ target groups ,\nProject Manager: yeah ?\nIndustrial Designer: what does that mean ?\nProject Manager: As uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh okay , 'kay .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So are {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: So we need to {disfmarker} yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself . So with that I think it's best if I hand over to you . Does anyone have a preference for going first ?\nIndustrial Designer: Alright . {vocalsound} I can go first ,\nProject Manager: You wanna go first ?\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nUser Interface: Okay . Hmm .\nProject Manager: Okay , so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: I assume we just pull it out ?\nUser Interface: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Right . Um {vocalsound} so f from the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we {disfmarker} you don't have to do it now but when {disfmarker} once you go back ,\nUser Interface: Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Right sure .\nProject Manager: just so that I don't have to scribble everything down .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh okay . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So n uh with uh with regard to the {vocalsound} uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um {vocalsound} a few basic uh components of the remote and uh {vocalsound} se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} {vocalsound} this is the method that uh I'll mostly be following in my um {vocalsound} in my uh role . Um the identification of the components , uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and {vocalsound} uh from the user interface person . Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and uh basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process . {vocalsound} Okay , so {vocalsound} these were the basic findings from today . The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email . Uh I just quickly jotted them down . Um {vocalsound} so basically uh the {disfmarker} as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um {vocalsound} and how the parts uh communicate with each other . Um {vocalsound} okay , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex . And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television . How however , our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the {vocalsound} the use for television , {vocalsound} in order to keep things simple . Um {vocalsound} also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it {disfmarker} so {vocalsound} it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard . {vocalsound} Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . Um {vocalsound} there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so {vocalsound} I'll basic go over to the {disfmarker} Okay . {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates {disfmarker} uh it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything . There is a user interface here . {vocalsound} So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal , um which then {disfmarker} so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , which is then communicated {vocalsound} to the remote site , which h has an infrared receiver . Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating . Um so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do , um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger , basically .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Um so {vocalsound} i in my personal preferences um {vocalsound} I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design , so that our um {vocalsound} uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions . {vocalsound} That's about it . {vocalsound} So anything that you would like to know or {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Thanks .\nProject Manager: Do you have any um i idea about costs at this point ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} No , I don't have any idea about what each component costs .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Br\nIndustrial Designer: Um yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay . 'Cause that's something to consider , I guess , if we're if we're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Certainly , yeah . So so tha yeah , {vocalsound} we definitely need to operate within our constraints ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: but um {vocalsound} unfortunately I I do not have any data , so uh I just identified the functional components for that .\nProject Manager: That's fine . Are there any more questions , or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , okay .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I think that will do . Okay , so do you want to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah . Yeah , I think since since we were discussing some um design issues then I I I would like to continue {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yes , shall shall we pull this up ?\nUser Interface: okay , yeah .\nProject Manager: I think that has to come out of there .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm 'kay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Thanks .\nProject Manager: Yeah , I thought those last minute things , they're gonna hit you the worst . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Oh i {vocalsound} Okay , I hope {disfmarker} wait . Should it just {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: I it'll take some time .\nProject Manager: It ta takes a little {disfmarker} Oh , and have you {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: There's just nothing .\nProject Manager: you need to then also press on yours , function F_ eight ,\nUser Interface: Oh right , right , right , um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight .\nUser Interface: Okay . Nothin\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , there it is , yeah .\nUser Interface: okay , something is coming up .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Now it's coming ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} It'll come up , it {disfmarker} um uh no signal .\nProject Manager: computer no signal .\nUser Interface: No signal ? Why ?\nProject Manager: Maybe again ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah yeah , it says something now ,\nUser Interface: Oh . My my computer went blank now .\nIndustrial Designer: adjusting {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay , adjusting .\nUser Interface: Adjusting . But {vocalsound} I don't see anything\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: There we go , there we go .\nUser Interface: I don't see anything on my computer now .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , that's strange .\nProject Manager: Oh , if you press if you press function and that again\nUser Interface: This is the problem , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: there's there's usually three modes , one where it's only here , one where it's only there , and one where it's both .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nUser Interface: Um {gap} .\nIndustrial Designer: And one more time .\nProject Manager: Okay , so one more time .\nUser Interface: Uh now it's {disfmarker} okay . No ? No .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Should {disfmarker} yeah just wait for a moment , adjusting .\nUser Interface: Oh okay .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nUser Interface: Okay , that's fine , that's good . Okay , let's start from the beginning . So I'm going to speak about technical functions design uh just like some {vocalsound} some first issues that came up . Um 'kay , so the method I was um adopting at this point , it's not um for the for the whole um period of the um {vocalsound} all the project but it's just at th at this very moment .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Um uh my method was um to look at um other {vocalsound} um remote controls , uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used . And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities . {vocalsound} And yeah , and then just to um {vocalsound} put the main function of the remote control in in words .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Um so the findings uh were {vocalsound} um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then mm {vocalsound} uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers . And and also the volume is very important . Um {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} I als\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Sorry , cou could you go back for a second ?\nUser Interface: okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh switching on off channel , uh volume , {vocalsound} okay , that's great .\nUser Interface: 'Kay . Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm {vocalsound} functionalities um in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players , but then {vocalsound} there are {disfmarker} surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size . And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something . Um then {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah , the must-have buttons would be on off and then {vocalsound} the channel numbers and then um {vocalsound} the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there . But then um other functionalities um {vocalsound} could be just {disfmarker} uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then , um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um {vocalsound} done through the menu . And yeah , the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: So at the {disfmarker} for the time being that's uh that's all .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: If you have questions {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: If {disfmarker} I mean that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had a a decent case for {disfmarker} that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see . It's w it's just whether it's worth arguing about .\nUser Interface: Yeah , and also it's it's um {disfmarker} other question is uh because there are so many different {disfmarker} And there are so many different things that could possibly be included\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the mm um video C_D_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Mm-hmm . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want . Um but um {vocalsound} so so at this stage , uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or {disfmarker} I mean in {disfmarker} we can completely do away with buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . But uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that ?\nUser Interface: Um well , I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use ,\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nUser Interface: I mean um what other options would you have ? A little screen or something , but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , and it'll make the costs {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: and and I mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly , not to spend time in like um giving several orders um I dunno .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons , but if if you have other mm proposals um .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an L_C_D_ display\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and uh with um {disfmarker} because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well . So yeah ? Cool .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . Yep .\nProject Manager: Sure , we can discuss that maybe after the next one .\nMarketing: Cool . Do you wanna give me the little cable thing ?\nProject Manager: Do you want to {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: Uh am I going in the right direction ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} No . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Wait .\nProject Manager: Oh , I'm getting hungry . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay , here it comes . Okay , here you are .\nMarketing: Cool . Ah , that's why it won't meet . {vocalsound} Okay , cool .\nProject Manager: You set ?\nMarketing: Yep , cool . Okay , functional requirements .\nProject Manager: Uh we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here .\nMarketing: Alright , yeah .\nProject Manager: Hello .\nIndustrial Designer: {gap} try to press {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Is it plugged in prop\nIndustrial Designer: oh , okay ,\nMarketing: It's working .\nProject Manager: it's working ?\nIndustrial Designer: yep .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: Cool , okay .\nProject Manager: Excellent .\nMarketing: So what I have , wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire . Um so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know . What's the most annoying things about remote controls and um the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control . Not that they actually gave me any answers on the L_C_D_ screens , so I should have taken that bit out , but anyway .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Um okay , so . What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , so you know , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . {vocalsound} Uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense . Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know , a nice looking remote control .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Um current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour well , as you'll see on the next slide . Um I dunno what zapping is , but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: It's um switching between channels , sort of randomly going through .\nMarketing: Oh , right . But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on . Um okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: so that's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control ,\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: they just make it look ugly .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: Okay ? Cool . Um so this is my little graph thing .\nProject Manager: Ooh , that's a bit difficult to see .\nMarketing: Mm k\nProject Manager: If you explain it to us it'll be fine .\nMarketing: Okay , well , I can send it to all of you . What it is is um it's cones ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: 'cause I thought they'd be more exciting . Um but {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I liked the , I liked the litt\nMarketing: ooh where's it go ?\nProject Manager: ooh come back .\nMarketing: Back . Oh .\nProject Manager: No .\nMarketing: Oh yes , cool . Okay , I'm gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Um okay , so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nMarketing: What you can't see is volume selection , it's a little bit higher than all the others .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm , that's the next one along , yeah ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance , you know ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: so on a scale of one to ten , how important is that\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , and the power , well it's not quite so essential , apparently , although I don't understand how it couldn't be ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} um and everything else , I think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , 'cause they're just not needed , and they're not used . Okay .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: This is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing . {vocalsound} Okay , cool . So um okay , so this is what people find annoying about remote controls . Uh that they get lost , that the uh you know , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: I think if you're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from um you know , watching T_V_ , then {vocalsound} that's the least of your problems ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} The remote control . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but you know , {vocalsound} it's up there .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Um that {disfmarker} yeah . Okay , so um I mean the the R_S_I_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know , not straining your wrists watching T_V_ {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yes . Okay , cool . Right , um sorry this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table , and I didn't have time to white it out again .\nProject Manager: That's alright .\nMarketing: Um okay , but that shows how people {disfmarker} whether they would pay more for voice recognition software . So you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite {disfmarker} are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it . Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_ , you know , tends to be people talking and um , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_ .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: Um okay ? Cool . Um okay , so these are my personal preferences . {vocalsound} So you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , so something that's , you know , a bit cool . Um you know , functional , so it's useful , but minimalist . Um there's a there's an important thing that , you know , people use when , you know , when you're filling up your home , you know , a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , basically , you know , and you've got all this stuff , and you're just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gonna use it ? You know , so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , so I think we need to aim for both .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . Mm .\nMarketing: Um okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and um , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Um and then like a locator , so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: not a mobile phone {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Some kind of a ring ,\nProject Manager: Keys and things like that ,\nIndustrial Designer: some {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , that's it , you know .\nProject Manager: yeah . Whistle and it {vocalsound} screams at you , yeah .\nMarketing: I know , it's weird . My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} So yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , something {vocalsound} {disfmarker} a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the T_V_ , you know ,\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something .\nIndustrial Designer: Hmm .\nMarketing: So okay ? Cool . That's me . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Okay , that's great ,\nProject Manager: That's you , excellent .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Um that's very good ,\nIndustrial Designer: thanks .\nProject Manager: Um .\nUser Interface: very interesting .\nProject Manager: I'm just gonna tick yes . So , we've got about ten , fifteen minutes to discuss\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . {vocalsound} I think one of the very interesting things that came up in um {vocalsound} uh Ka Kate Cat Cat's uh presentation was um {vocalsound} uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people .\nMarketing: Cat's . Ca {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: So if we need to have a target group um then uh {vocalsound} I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and uh you know , good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know , people who are comparatively elderly . Um .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah , I mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control ,\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: but I'm assuming , you know , yes .\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so if you want to put in something stylish , then uh th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nProject Manager: Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket\nIndustrial Designer: Right , and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: and the {disfmarker} I don't know how often they're buying televisions .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Right . Mm .\nMarketing: Well , that's when you go to uni , isn't it ? So , you know {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah , but you don't have much money , generally .\nUser Interface: Yeah . Yeah ,\nProject Manager: I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: you share a television or something that {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But uh still , if if you can go back to that slide and uh , how popular was it ?\nProject Manager: O oh it's on {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Oh , I've unplugged it .\nProject Manager: sorry , we unplugged it .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , oh , okay . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Do you want me to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Here , let me {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: That's alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five , uh how popular was {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: Seventy six point three percent .\nIndustrial Designer: so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them .\nUser Interface: It was seventy something , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So even they are seventy six percent , is that high amount ?\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Yeah , I kn I mean I know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: but I mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like {disfmarker} I mean , you know , if you're at university , you're paying your rent ,\nProject Manager: Yeah , they've got no commitments and\nMarketing: but you don't have a mortgage , you don't have a life insurance policy ,\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nMarketing: you don't normally have a car ,\nProject Manager: usually not a car and all of those things .\nMarketing: yeah , so .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: You're still learning to drive actually ,\nProject Manager: Kids . Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So you're more likely to b\nMarketing: so that just costs more than a car ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} but yeah . Um so I mean like it is an age group to target , really , I think .\nProject Manager: Yeah , and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price , that's not unaffordable , even for young people .\nMarketing: No , I mean that's what , that's like fifteen Pounds ? You know , I think {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah this this is not {vocalsound} unaffordable ,\nProject Manager: {gap}\nUser Interface: but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a T_V_ {vocalsound} to use its full {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , I d I don't know many people without a T_V_ . We didn't have a T_V_ last year ,\nProject Manager: But do they {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: and everyone thought we were off our heads , you know .\nProject Manager: But the T_V_s are often kind of someone's old T_V_ that's blah blah\nUser Interface: Common , the students {disfmarker} yeah , yeah . The s the stu\nProject Manager: and be a bit strange to have a fancy {vocalsound} rome remote .\nUser Interface: yeah , and the remote control might not {disfmarker} yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm\nUser Interface: it might not even function with the old T_V_ .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular , right ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , I d well we've we've got quite a d decent T_V_ .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: So mm uh are are are {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: we're still {disfmarker} yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Or w maybe we can just kind of uh uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I think I think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: You know , so I mean that and the disposable income and {disfmarker} I don't think it's something to ignore , you know .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: because actually I mean they're all still re young people .\nMarketing: Is not a massive difference , you know . No , do totally .\nProject Manager: Yeah , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Um {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Is that gonna have a {disfmarker} an implication for the technical specs ?\nIndustrial Designer: I was having a a general outlook on um m most like sophisticated features , but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about , because one of the p uh things that Cat pointed out was uh uh how do we go about implementing it ? Uh and uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: You do have it in your mobile phone though , don't you ? Because you have like {disfmarker} I mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . But how frequently do we use it anyway\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and um uh h ho how good is it ,\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I don't know .\nProject Manager: Yeah . With um {disfmarker} but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five ,\nUser Interface: An\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: S so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: louder ,\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Okay .\nProject Manager: tha that should be relatively simple .\nIndustrial Designer: O {vocalsound}\nMarketing: y you'd maybe need a code word . Do you know what I mean ?\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: So like when you say change , except that's {vocalsound} being said quite a lot on T_V_ ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nMarketing: so maybe like , you know , remote . I mean how often do people say remote on T_V_ ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Although I only watch Charmed , so really {vocalsound} I wouldn't know\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: but like so you'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine .\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay , so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check .\nIndustrial Designer: {disfmarker} yeah .\nProject Manager: Um , so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money ,\nUser Interface: Yeah but uh um {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah sure , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: then they'll they'll still go for the same advertising .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: I don't think there's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls .\nUser Interface: Yeah , w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but I think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nUser Interface: and um , yeah it's it's kind of safer , so we we need both ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . W\nProject Manager: I think we need both .\nIndustrial Designer: What uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: What wh uh {vocalsound} what I was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . If we can do with {disfmarker} away with that , our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say , I want to watch uh I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh . Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , so if uh if something like that can be incorporated , {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , that would be another way to do it .\nProject Manager: So that if that was in the the voice recognition , that would be great .\nIndustrial Designer: some kind of {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , but then the code word would be even more important , because {disfmarker} I mean Sky advertise on every channel , don't they , you know ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: so then it would be {disfmarker} you'd be watching Charmed , and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Watch Sky and {vocalsound} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , that's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: and that would be really annoying . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . But that's definitely a possibility .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: Yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control isn't {vocalsound} as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: and and the T_V_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there .\nMarketing: Yeah . Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} So that you can yell at it ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , you know , so you have to have the remote control .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nMarketing: It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it {vocalsound} and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Alright .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but then the remote control I think {disfmarker} I mean {vocalsound} um the idea is kind of {disfmarker} it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah , I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: being cl I mean it'll it'll {disfmarker} mm .\nUser Interface: No , but I I I was just defending the {vocalsound} the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and uh not to yell at it from the distance .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . So uh {vocalsound} wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so we we can probably come to know where it is .\nProject Manager: That's {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: but then if you're buying the remote separately ,\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: but y {vocalsound} you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something ,\nUser Interface: Oh yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right , yeah , yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: some {disfmarker} like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the T_V_ .\nUser Interface: Okay , yeah , mm-hmm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control .\nProject Manager: The l\nIndustrial Designer: Alright , yeah .\nProject Manager: Well that's right , but it solves the problem of having different noises .\nMarketing: Yeah , definitely , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . Okay , I think we're gonna have to wrap this up um . But if we go away with that that kind of general um {vocalsound} specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option\nUser Interface: The major ones , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you'll get immediately by email . Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and then we've got a lunch break\nIndustrial Designer: {gap}\nProject Manager: and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Um I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know .\nIndustrial Designer: So where exactly is this i\nProject Manager: It should be on your desktop , so on the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Ah , okay .\nProject Manager: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: So I'll put it {disfmarker} I'll put them there as soon as I've written them .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Did you find it ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah in that one ,\nUser Interface: It's just {disfmarker} yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: right yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , and email them round .\nMarketing: Oh , so y you want our um PowerPoint presentations in there , hey ?\nProject Manager: Yeah , that would be great .\nMarketing: Okay .\nUser Interface: Oh so so we'll just put them i there ,\nProject Manager: Oh yeah , put them in there . Yeah ,\nUser Interface: we we {disfmarker} yeah , w we won't even {disfmarker} okay .\nMarketing: There you go .\nProject Manager: then you don't have to email them .\nMarketing: But is everyone's called functional requirements ?\nIndustrial Designer: No .\nProject Manager: No , they're all called something slightly different . Technical requirements and something something , yeah .\nMarketing: Okay , so that's good .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: That's me done .\nProject Manager: So , if you put them in there , we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to .\nMarketing: Okay , cool .\nProject Manager: Um {vocalsound} as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Yeah ? Whatever that means .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} I guess I'll find out . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: You'll be looking {vocalsound} you'll be looking at the user interface concept ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Uh something conceptual , yeah .\nProject Manager: on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: um we'll keep keep our options op hmm ?\nIndustrial Designer: Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ? Con components , oh .\nProject Manager: Components ,\nUser Interface: Hmm . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: yeah .\nUser Interface: Sorry , but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch or {vocalsound} shall we prepare our {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No , we have we have {disfmarker} after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare ,\nUser Interface: To prepare , okay , yeah , that's good .\nProject Manager: so that's fine , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Okay ? Right on time .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Cool . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Okay , {vocalsound} so you can {disfmarker} I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec ? {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Okay , see you .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the presentations on working design, technical functions, functional requirements.\nAnswer:", "input_tokens": 8525}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The nations have also agreed to form a joint North and South Korean women's ice hockey team for the Games in Pyeongchang, which begin early next month, South Korea's unification ministry said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The unification ministry announced a range of joint activities between the countries for the Games, following talks Wednesday at the demilitarized zone (DMZ). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR North and South Korean skiers will train together at a resort in North Korea before the Olympics start, and performers from the two countries will also hold a joint cultural event at Mount Kumgang. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR North Korea will also send around 230 supporters to cheer on its athletes. A smaller delegation of North Korean athletes and supporters will attend the Paralympics, the ministry said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Korean Unification Flag features a blue silhouette of the peninsula and outlying islands. The two countries have marched under the flag before, in rare shows of unity, first at the 1991 World Table Tennis Championships, and at a number of sporting events since. It was most recently used at the 2006 Winter Games in Turin, Italy NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The International Olympics Committee (IOC) would need to approve the countries' agreements, and those that affect competition, such as the joint hockey team, could be more complicated than the ceremonial proposals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The committee said Wednesday it had received a number of \"interesting proposals\" that it would discuss with delegates from both countries in Switzerland on Saturday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are sure that the two Korean delegations will present their ideas and proposals at the meeting on Saturday in Lausanne. This will then enable the IOC to carefully evaluate the consequences and the potential impact on the Olympic Games and the Olympic competitions,\" it said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Diplomatic thaw NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wednesday's announcement is the latest breakthrough since talks began between the two Koreas earlier this month, after years of broken communications. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the two sides have earned praise for ratcheting down military tensions in recent weeks, some of Seoul's allies voiced concern Wednesday that Pyongyang may be using the talks to buy time to pursue its weapons program. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The US military has moved more firepower to the region and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned of complacency at a Tuesday summit in Vancouver where the top diplomats from the United States, Japan, Canada and the United Kingdom were in town to discuss North Korea. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono called on the international community to be clear-eyed about North Korea's motivations for participating in the talks, which have been hailed by some as the most significant thaw in ties in years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I believe that North Korea wants to buy some time to continue their nuclear and missile programs,\" Kono said at the meeting. \"It's not the time to ease pressure towards North Korea.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR China denounced the Vancouver talks, and the United Nations Command, under whose framework they are being held, as demonstrating \"Cold War mentality.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"(Such thinking) will only lead to split in the international community and harm the joint efforts that could properly solve the nuclear issue on Korea peninsula,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Wednesday.

Korean skaters' dream alive 02:41 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Limited progress NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It remains to be seen how much progress achieved before the Olympics will be retained after the games are over, or if tensions will again worsen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR John Park, director of the Korea Working Group at the Harvard Kennedy School, warned against viewing the talks as a major breakthrough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Both Koreas are primarily utilizing the talks for a limited objective -- arranging the participation of a North Korean delegation in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics,\" Park said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR South Korea's Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said the talks were a \"significant step\" but acknowledged the serious challenges ahead: \"Despite these overtures to improve relations with the South, North Korea has yet to show any intention to fulfill its international obligations regarding denuclearization.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR North Korea has remained adamant throughout this month's thaw in relations with South Korea that its nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles are here to stay. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joint US-South Korea military drills -- which always infuriate Pyongyang and raise tensions on the peninsula -- have been suspended for the duration of the upcoming Olympics as a show of good faith, but they are likely resume following the competition.\nPassage 2:\nSEOUL (Reuters) - The two Koreas will field a combined womenâs ice hockey team and march together under one flag at next monthâs Winter Olympics in the South, Seoul said on Wednesday, after a new round of talks amid a thaw in cross-border ties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR North and South Korea have been talking since last week - for the first time in more than two years - about the Olympics, offering a respite from a months-long standoff over Pyongyangâs nuclear and missile programs, although Japan urged caution over the Northâs âcharm offensiveâ. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two Koreas will compete as a unified team in the Olympics for the first time, though they have joined forces at other international sports events before. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR North Korea will send a delegation of more than 400, including 230 cheerleaders, 140 artists and 30 Taekwondo players for a demonstration, a joint press statement released by Seoulâs Unification Ministry said, adding the precise number of athletes will be hammered out after discussions with the IOC scheduled for later this week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prior to the Games, the sides will carry out joint training for skiers at the Northâs Masik Pass resort and a cultural event at the Mount Kumgang resort, for which Seoul officials plan to visit the sites next week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR âUnder the circumstances where inter-Korean (relations) are extremely strained, in fact just some 20 days ago we werenât expecting North Korea would participate in the Olympicsâ, said Chun Hae-sung, the Southâs chief negotiator and vice unification minister. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR âIt would have a significant meaning if the South and North show reconciliation and unity, for example through a joint marchâ. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The North Korean delegation will begin arriving in South Korea on Jan. 25, according to the joint statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The North will separately send a 150-strong delegation to the Paralympics, Chun said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR âITâS NOT THE TIMEâ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Twenty nations meeting in the Canadian city of Vancouver agreed on Tuesday to consider tougher sanctions to press North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned the North it could trigger a military response if it did not choose dialogue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said the world should not be naive about North Koreaâs âcharm offensiveâ over the Olympics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR âIt is not the time to ease pressure, or to reward North Koreaâ, Kono said. âThe fact that North Korea is engaging in dialogue could be interpreted as proof that the sanctions are working.â NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has refused to give up development of nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States in spite of increasingly severe U.N. sanctions, raising fears of a new war on the Korean peninsula. The North has fired test-fired missiles over Japan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier on Wednesday, state media warned the U.S. of âmeddlingâ in inter-Korean issues at a time when it had to âmind its own destiny rushing headlong into self-destructionâ.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR âThe U.S. is miscalculating,â the Northâs Rodong Sinmun newspaper said in a commentary. âAlthough the U.S. makes desperate efforts to disturb peace while wielding a nuclear stick, it can not provoke us as long as we have the strong nuclear deterrentâ. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ICY RECEPTION NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seoul has proposed a joint ice hockey team, which triggered an angry response from athletes in the South suddenly being told they may have to play alongside total strangers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR âI donât know if it will happen, but a joint team will be a good opportunity for ice hockey to shed its sorrow as a less-preferred sport as many Koreans will take interest,â South Korean President Moon Jae-in told players during a visit to a training center. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The number of petitions to the presidential Blue Houseâs website opposing a unified team shot up to more than 100 this week, with the most popular one garnering more than 17,000 votes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR âThis isnât the same as gluing a broken plate together,â said one of the signers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The prospect of a combined team had long been unsettling for the South Korean players. As in most other winter sports, the South is much stronger than the North. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR âOur players were really nervous,â Sarah Murray, South Korean womenâs hockey head coach, told Reuters last month during the teamâs training swing through the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR âWe can only take 23 players to the Olympics, and they thought these North Koreans are going to come in and take our spotsâ, Murray said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chun, the Southâs lead delegate, said the decision on a united ice hockey team is not yet finalised, as it requires the consent of the IOC and related international body. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR âWeâre well aware of the peopleâs concerns and interests about thisâ, he told a news conference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR âBut I would like you to see the other side that it could make a positive contribution to peace of the Korean Peninsula and improving inter-Korean relationsâ. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Tuesday, the North said a 140-person orchestra would perform in South Korea during the Games. Pyongyang is also planning to send a large delegation in addition to the athletes and orchestra. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Paik Hak-soon, the director of the Center for North Korean studies at Sejong Institute in South Korea, said North Korea was using the cheering squad to draw attention to its apparent cooperative spirit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR âSeeing good results in competitions thanks to the cheering squad would enable the North Koreans to say they contributed to a successful Olympics and the South Korean government would likely agree,â said Paik. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Slideshow (5 Images) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR âIn the end, they are using this old tactic to get to Washington through Seoul.â NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reclusive North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. The North regularly threatens to destroy the South, Japan and their major ally, the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR China, which did not attend the Vancouver meeting, said on Wednesday the gathering showed a Cold War mentality and would only undermine a settlement of the North Korea problem.\nPassage 3:\nNorth and South Korea will march under one flag as their first joint Olympic team competes in the winter games next month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang, the teams will march together under the Unification Flag, which features the entire peninsula and surrounding islands in blue on a white background. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was last used in 2006 at the Winter Olympics in Italy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It comes as the countries announced they will field a joint women's ice hockey team at the Winter Olympics in February. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR North Korea will send a 550-member delegation to the games, which includes 230 cheerleaders, 140 artists and 30 taekwondo players for a demonstration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They will begin arriving in South Korea on 25 January. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image: The teams march under one flag at the East Asian Games in 2005 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officials have also agreed that a 140-piece orchestra from North Korea will perform in the South during the Olympics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR North and South Korea are still technically at war with each other, as the 1950-53 conflict between the two states ended in a truce, not peace. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Representatives from both countries have been talking with each other since last week, after more than two years of silence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image: North Koreans (red shirts) cheer as South Koreans (yellow shirts) wave unified Korean peninsula flags in 2003 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The move also follows heightened tensions over the North's missile tests, nuclear weapons programme and its regular threats to destroy its neighbours. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite a slight thawing of tensions, Japan has warned that the world should not be naive about the North's \"charm offensive\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is not the time to ease pressure or to reward North Korea,\" foreign minister Taro Kono said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The fact that North Korea is engaging in dialogue could be interpreted as proof that the sanctions are working.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reaction to news of a joint Olympic team has been mixed in North Korea, with some athletes not happy about competing with their neighbours. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than 100 petitions have been sent to South Korea's presidential Blue House website opposing a joint Olympics team. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image: North Korean Jon Jong Su crosses the border to attend talks at the truce village of Panmunjom NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The most popular has more than 11,000 signatures, with one person writing: \"This isn't the same as gluing a broken plate together\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR North Korea's Rodong Sinmun newspaper said the relationship between the North and the South was \"going towards detente\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it criticised Japan's leader for refusing to ease the pressure on Pyongyang without the latter taking steps towards de-nuclearisation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It said: \"The detente on the Korean peninsula is unfavourable for the (Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo) Abe group whose ultimate goal is to convert Japan into a war state.

The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nPont d'Arc\nThe Pont d'Arc (French pont = bridge) is a large natural bridge, located in the ArdÃ¨che dÃ©partement in the south of France, 5Â km from the town of Vallon-Pont-d'Arc. \n\nThe arch, carved out by the ArdÃ¨che River, is  wide and  high.  It is a very popular canoeing and kayaking area and is heavily visited by tourists. It is usually described as the natural entrance to the ArdÃ¨che Canyon.\n\nIn the near vicinity of the arch is the Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave, containing the earliest known paleolithic cave paintings, about 30,000 years old (featured in the 3D documentary Cave of Forgotten Dreams by film director Werner Herzog).\nQuestion:\nThe Pont d'Arc is a massive natural stone arch spanning which river that gives its name to a French department?\nAnswer:\nArdeche\nPassage:\nMahÃ©, Seychelles\nMahÃ© is the largest island (157.3Â kmÂ²) of the Seychelles, lying in the north east of the nation. The population of MahÃ© was 77,000, as of the 2010 census.  It contains the capital city of Victoria and accommodates 86% of the country's total population.  The island was named after Bertrand-FranÃ§ois MahÃ© de La Bourdonnais, a French governor of Mauritius.\n\nMahÃ©'s tallest peak is Morne Seychellois at 905 m, which lies in the Morne Seychellois National Park.  The northern and eastern parts of the island are home to much of the population and the Seychelles International Airport which opened in 1971. The southern and western parts have Baie Ternay Marine National Park, Port Launay Marine National Park, and University of Seychelles. The Sainte Anne Marine National Park lies offshore, as do Conception Island, ThÃ©rÃ¨se Island, Anonyme Island and several smaller islands.\n\nMahÃ© was first visited by the British in 1609 and not visited by Europeans again until Lazare Picault's expedition of 1742. In August 1801 a Royal Navy frigate HMS Sibylle captured the French frigate Chiffonne on the island. MahÃ© remained a French possession until 1812 when it became a British colony. It remained a colony until 1976 when Seychelles became an independent nation.\n\nMahÃ©'s forests have rare endemic plants found only in the Seychelles, such as the critically endangered Medusagyne oppositifolia (the \"Jellyfish tree\"), the carnivorous Seychelles Pitcher plant and many species of unique orchids.\n\nMahÃ© had a huge land reclamation project due to a shortage of housing, in the areas of Bel Ombre and the Port of Victoria. \n\nEconomy\n\nMahÃ©'s economy is mainly dependent on tourism.\nAir Seychelles has its head office on the property of Seychelles International Airport on the island.

The show, which ran to 71 episodes over six series, was originally broadcast by the BBC between 10 January 1986 and 4 December 1994, although there was a five-year gap between the first and second series. It was adapted for television by Ian La Frenais.\n\nThe series concerns the adventures of the eponymous Lovejoy, played by Ian McShane, a likeable but roguish antiques dealer based in East Anglia. Within the trade, he has a reputation as a \"divvie\", a person with almost supernatural powers for recognising exceptional items as well as distinguishing genuine antiques from clever fakes or forgeries.\n\nCharacters\n\n* Lovejoy, played by Ian McShane (series one to six), less than scrupulous yet likeable rogue antique dealer.  \n* Eric Catchpole, played by Chris Jury (series one to five), Lovejoy's younger, enthusiastic but ever so slightly dim assistant. \n* Tinker Dill, played by Dudley Sutton (series one to six), barker and tout who is friends with Lovejoy.  \n* Lady Jane Felsham, played by Phyllis Logan (series one to five), has a friendly relationship with Lovejoy, often helping him with his deals.\n* Beth Taylor, played by Diane Parish (series five and six), Lovejoy's new apprentice following the departure of Eric Catchpole.\n* Charlie Gimbert, played by Malcolm Tierney (series one, series four to six), Lovejoy's nemesis within the antiques trade\n* Charlotte Cavendish, played by Caroline Langrishe (series five and six), an auctioneer who becomes Lovejoy's love interest.\n* Lovejoy's daughter: \n:Kate (series one) played by Charlotte Edwards.\n:Vicky (series two and three) played by Amelia Shankley\n:Viki (series six) played by Amelia Curtis\n\nBroadcast history\n\nThe series was notable for its style and pacing. Lovejoy would frequently break the fourth wall, revealing his thoughts and motives \nby addressing the audience directly. The first series was shown on BBC1 in the first half of 1986. It concluded with a two-part special. Despite being a moderate ratings success, Lovejoy was not brought back until 1991. Most of the original cast returned for the next two series between 1991 and 1992. With the start of the fourth series in 1993, Malcolm Tierney reprised his first series role as Charlie Gimbert.\n\nDuring the fifth series, several cast changes were made. Lady Jane Felsham (played by Phyllis Logan) left the show in the second episode and Eric Catchpole (played by Chris Jury) departed in the sixth episode, although both characters returned for the sixth series finale. Two new regular characters were added: Lovejoy's new apprentice, Beth Taylor (played by Diane Parish), and Charlotte Cavendish (played by Caroline Langrishe), who ran a local antiques auction house.\n\nThe sixth and final series of 10 episodes was aired between October and December 1994.\n\nTwo 90-minute Lovejoy Christmas specials were shown in 1992 and 1993.\n\nThe theme tune used in the opening and end credits, as well as the incidental music for each episode, was composed by Denis King.\n\nAdaptation\n\nThe television version respected the author's wish not to reveal Lovejoy's first name. Just as in the books, Lovejoy's first name is never mentioned in the TV series; the character insists on being addressed simply as \"Lovejoy\".\n\nHowever, the novel's lechery and violence was toned down along with the amount of antique lore and terminology.\n\nLikewise the character of Lovejoy's favourite 'barker', Tinker Dill, was cleaned up for the television series. Within the novels, he is portrayed as a malodorous, seldom-bathed individual although his penchant for strong drink was retained in the series.\n\nReleases\n\nThe series was first aired in the United States on the A&E Network. It was marketed as The Lovejoy Mysteries on VHS in the U.S. The DVD release of the entire series has returned to title of Lovejoy.\nQuestion:\n\"The lead character in the TV series \"\"Lovejoy\"\", which was based on stories by John Grant (under the pen name Jonathan Gash), was an expert in what?\"\nAnswer:\nAntique\nPassage:\nTed Lowe\nEdwin Charles Ernest Lowe, MBE  (1 November 1920 â 1 May 2011),  known as Ted Lowe, was an English snooker commentator for the BBC. His unmistakably husky, hushed tones earned him the nickname \"Whispering Ted\".\n\nLife and career\n\nBorn in Lambourn, Berkshire, Lowe was general manager of London's Leicester Square Hall, the home of professional billiards and snooker. He got his break one day when the BBC's regular commentator, Raymond Glendenning, succumbed to laryngitis.  He was the commentator for the snooker television show Pot Black from 1969. He went on to become the \"voice of snooker\" and led the commentary in many tournaments. He also commentated in what is generally regarded as snooker's greatest final, that between Steve Davis and Dennis Taylor in the 1985 World Snooker Championship.\n\nLowe uttered the occasional on-air gaffe, one of his most famous quotes being, \"and for those of you who are watching in black and white, the pink is next to the green.\"  He once told viewers that Fred Davis, struggling to rest one leg on the edge of the table in order to reach a long shot, \"is getting on a bit and is having trouble getting his leg over\".  \n\nLowe retired after the 1996 World Snooker Championship final, although he briefly joined in the commentary for the 2005 World Championship final between Matthew Stevens and Shaun Murphy, which Murphy won.\n\nLowe died, aged 90, in Bexhill-on-Sea, on the morning of the first session of the 2011 World Snooker Championship final. He is survived by his wife Jean, daughter Margaret and son Michael.\n\nRecalling Lowe after his death, multiple world champion Stephen Hendry, who was once described by Lowe as the \"wonder bairn of Scotland\", said: \"I remember playing Junior Pot Black, I was only 12 and he was a complete gentleman. Me and my father were down there and he was so nice to us.\"\nQuestion:\nOn which sport did 'Whispering Ted Lowe' commentate on TV?\nAnswer:\nLightning break\n\n\nPassage:\nPennsylvania State Capitol, Harrisburg - TripAdvisor\nPennsylvania State Capitol, Harrisburg - TripAdvisor\nWant the lowest hotel prices?

The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nHistory of canals in Great Britain - London Canal Museum\nHistory of canals in Great Britain\nHome > History > Canals in Britain\nIn the history of canals, Britain was not a pioneer. The Chinese can     claim that the Grand Canal of China was one of the first, in the tenth century,     although even earlier examples existed in that country. The earliest canals     were connected with natural rivers, either as short extensions or improvements     to them. The difference between a natural river, and a wholly man-made canal is     clear, but in between are many variations of river improvement and extension so     it is therefore difficult to be precise about which navigation can claim to be     the first canal! The familiar pound lock which is in use today in Britain is     said to have been invented by Chhiao Wei-Yo, in the year 983, in China,     although the mitre gate, an important part of the canal lock today, is credited     to Leonardo Da Vinci.n (1452 - 1519)\nIn Britain the Romans built the Fossdyke from     Lincoln to the River Trent , for drainage and for navigation and also the Caer     Dyke around AD 50. A notable waterway completed in 1566 was the Exeter Canal     which bypassed part of a river to make navigation easier. This had the first     pound locks in Britain, equipped with lifting, vertical gates. The mitre gate,     which has V shaped gates held together by the water pressure, was introduced in     this country on the River Lee, at Waltham Abbey. Some other early British     canals are an improved section of the River Welland in Lincolnshire, built in     1670, and the Stroudwater Navigation, in Gloucestershire, built 1775 - 1779 and     the Sankey Canal in Lancashire, opened in stages, 1757 - 1773.\nThe great age of canal building started with the construction of the     Bridgewater Canal. This pioneering waterway is nowhere near the town of     Bridgwater but was the initiative of the third Duke of Bridgewater, pictured     left (image coutesy of The National     Trust ). A well educated young man, the Duke had visited a great early     French navigation, the Canal du Midi, 150 miles long, which had been completed     in 1681. The Duke owned coal mines at Worsley, north west of Manchester, a big     city with an appetite for coal. The Duke made plans together with John Gilbert,     one of his estate managers, and they brought in the engineer James Brindley     (1716 - 1772) who had previously built a reputation working on mills, water     wheels etc. The enabling Act was passed in 1759 and there were further Acts of     Parliament to amend and extend the scheme. Completed in 1776 the Bridgewater     Canal was the catalyst that started half a century of canal building. Brindley     had built an aqueduct which was regarded as a remarkable achievement, and there     were tunnels right into the mines at Worsley where the coal was loaded. The     price of coal in Manchester fell as the new means of transport made cheap     deliveries possible.\nNext there followed a number of long distance navigations, with     Brindley as the leading canal engineer of his time. He largely built the     so-called \"Grand Cross\" of canals which linked the four great river basins of     Britain, the Severn, Mersey, Humber, and the Thames, the latter being reached     from 1790 via the Oxford Canal, lengthy route to London from the north. There     were two concentrated periods of canal building, from 1759 to the early 1770's     and from 1789 to almost the end of the eighteenth century. The American War of     Independence separated the two periods. London and the south east did not     feature much in the first period. Canals were built to serve the heavy industry     of the north and midlands and whilst London had industry and the country's     major port, it did not have coal mines and the surrounding south east of     England was mainly agricultural.\nIt was not until 1793 that an Act was passed to authorise the Grand     Junction Canal from Braunston on the Oxford Canal, to Brentford on the river     Thames west of London. London was not joined directly to the national canal     network until 1801 with the opening of the Paddington Arm of the Grand Junction     Canal.\nSome Useful Links for Further Reading\nLeonardo Da Vinci     National Museum of Science and Technology , Milan for more about Da Vinci     and his invention of the type of lock known in the UK as a mitre lock.\nLeonardo Museum,     Vinci, Italy , for further references to Da Vinci's life and work\nQuestion:\nThe Fossdyke was possibly the first to be built in Britain â what was it?\nAnswer:\nCanal\nPassage:\nSadie Hawkins Day\nSadie Hawkins Day is an American folk event and pseudo-holiday originated by Al Capp's classic hillbilly comic strip Li'l Abner (1934â1978). This inspired real-world Sadie Hawkins events, the premise of which is that females ask males for a date or dancing.\n\nOriginal story\n\nIn Li'l Abner, Sadie Hawkins was the daughter of one of Dogpatch's earliest settlers, Hekzebiah Hawkins. The \"homeliest gal in all them hills,\" she grew frantic waiting for suitors. When she reached the age of 35, still a spinster, her father was worried about Sadie living at home for the rest of her life. In desperation, he called together all the unmarried men of Dogpatch and declared it \"Sadie Hawkins Day\". A foot race was decreed, with Sadie pursuing the town's eligible bachelors. She was specifically interested in a handsome boy named Adam Olis who was already in a courtship with a cute girl, Theresa, whose father was the area's largest potato farmer, Bill Richmand, and, unlike Sadie, had a number of courtship offers. Adam was invited to the race  because Miss Theresa and Adam weren't actually engaged. With matrimony as the (absurd) consequence of losing the foot race, the bachelors of the town were running for their freedom. Adam Olis scored fourth place out of 10, leaving John Jonston as Sadie's prize. It is possible that the concept's origins are in an inversion of the myth of Atalanta, who, reluctant to marry, agreed to wed whoever could outrun her in a footrace.\n\n The town spinsters decided that this was a good idea, so they made Sadie Hawkins Day a mandatory yearly event, much to the chagrin of Dogpatch's bachelors. If a woman caught a bachelor and dragged him, kicking and screaming, across the finish line before sundown, by law he had to marry her.\n\nSadie Hawkins Day was first mentioned in the November 15, 1937 Li'l Abner daily comic strip, with the race actually being depicted between November 19 and November 30. It would prove to be an annual feature of Li'l Abner. (see Schreiner, Dave; \"Sadie's First Run\", Li'l Abner Dailies Volume 3: 1937, Kitchen Sink Press, Princeton, WI, p. 8.)\n\n(See also: Leap year for discussion of a similar tradition of \"allowing\" women to propose marriage on February 29.)\n\nIn popular culture\n\nDuring 1939, only two years after its inauguration, a double-page spread in Life magazine proclaimed, \"On Sadie Hawkins Day, Girls Chase Boys in 201 Colleges\" and printed pictures from Texas Wesleyan. Capp originally created it as a comic plot device, but by the early 1940s the comic strip event had acquired a life of its own. By 1952, Sadie Hawkins Day was reportedly celebrated at 40,000 known venues. It became a day-long event observed in the United States on the first Saturday after November 9.\n\nThe practical basis of a real Sadie Hawkins Day is one of simple traditional gender role-reversal. Women and girls take the initiative by inviting the man or boy of their choice out on a dateâ- rare before 1937â- typically to a dance attended by other bachelors and their assertive dates. When Capp created the event, it wasn't his intention to have it occur annually on a specific date because it inhibited his plotting.

The region holds significance as a region of historical importance, a major trading corridor, an economic and political powerhouse, and \nis currently geostrategic in that borders 5 nations major naval outlet to the Mediterranean Sea via two straits: Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, and Georgia.  The region also serves as a future connector of existing Turkish and European high speed rail networks.\n\nDefinition\n\nEast Thrace includes all in the eastern part of the historical region of Thrace. The area includes all the territories of the Turkish provinces of Edirne, TekirdaÄ and KÄ±rklareli, as well as those territories on the European Continent of the provinces of Ãanakkale and Istanbul.\n\nClimate\n\nDue to the moderating effect of the surrounding seas, the climate tends to be Mediterranean in character.\n\nGeography \n\nEast Thrace has an area of 23,764Â km2 (3 percent of the country) and a population of about 10 million people (about 12 percent of the total); the population density is around 430 people/km2, compared to about 80 people/km2 for Asiatic Turkey, which is also called Anatolia or Asia Minor.  However, densities are skewed by the metropolis of Istanbul.  The two are separated by the Dardanelles, the Bosphorus (collectively known as the Turkish Straits) and the Sea of Marmara, a route of about 361Â km. The southernmost part of Eastern Thrace is called the Gallipoli peninsula. European Turkey is bordered on the west by Greece for 212Â km and on the north by Bulgaria for 269Â km, with the Aegean Sea to the south-west and the Black Sea to the north-east.  \n\n*** Disclaimer: Sources may modify and/or release updated data, this will not be automatically reflected in these tables, additionally the refugee crisis' vast floating migrants have seriously complicated data collection, especially since 2013.

The key is often strung around the child's neck or left hidden under a mat (or some other object) at the rear door to the property. The term seems to first appear in a CBC radio program called \"Discussion Club - Topic: How War Affects Canadian Children\" in 1942,  due to the phenomenon of children being left home alone during World War II,  when the father would be enlisted into the armed forces and the mother would need to get a job. Given that the \"Discussion Club\" participants are all familiar with the term and allude to it being in colloquial usage, it likely predates 1942. In general, the term latchkey designates \"those children between the ages of five and thirteen who care for themselves after the school day until their parents or guardians return home\". \n\nMore specifically for their purposes, the San Marino (CA) Public Library has defined a Library Latchkey Child as \"one who on a regular basis is required by their parents or guardian to remain at the public library for extended periods of time after school in lieu of day care. 'Regular basis' is defined as three or more days per week. 'Extended period' is defined as two or more hours per day\" (American Library Association 12). \n\nThe term latchkey kid became commonplace to describe members of Generation X, who according to a 2004 marketing study, âwent through its all-important, formative years as one of the least parented, least nurtured generations in U.S. history.â  Latchkey kids were prevalent during this time, a result of increased divorce rates and increased maternal participation in the workforce, at a time before childcare options outside the home were widely available.     These latchkey children, referred to as \"day orphans\" in the 1984 documentary, To Save Our Children to Save Our Schools, came predominately from middle or upper-class homes. The higher the educational attainment of the parents, the higher the odds the children of this time would be latchkey kids.  \n\nEffects on children\n\nThe effects of being a latchkey child differ with age. Loneliness, boredom and fear are most common for those younger than 10 years of age. In the early teens, there is a greater susceptibility to peer pressure, potentially resulting in such behaviors as alcohol abuse, drug abuse, sexual promiscuity and smoking.   The behaviors might stem from \"unspent energy, peer pressure to misbehave, or hostility because of the lack of appropriate adult attention\".  However, some children can exude positive effects, such as an early development of self-reliance, adaptation to difficult situations, and a desire to contribute to a visible need in the household.\n\nSocioeconomic status and length of time left alone can bring forth other negative effects. In one study, middle school students left home alone for more than three hours a day reported higher levels of behavioral problems, higher rates of depression, and lower levels of self-esteem than other students. \n\nChildren from lower income families are associated with greater externalizing issues (such as conduct disorders and hyperactivity) and academic problems. This association was weaker for children from middle income families as compared to their supervised peers.  In 2000, a German PISA study found no significant differences in the scholastic performance between \"latchkey kids\" and kids in a \"nuclear family\". \n\nPositive effects of being a latchkey child include independence and self-reliance at a young age. Deborah Belle, author of The After-School Lives of Children: Alone and with Others While Parents Work suggests that being left home alone may be a better alternative to staying with baby-sitters or older siblings. \n\nLegal issues\n\nThe legality of the latchkey children's \"alone time\" varies with country, state and local area. In the United States, state and local laws typically do not specify any particular age under 18 when a child can be legally left without supervision. However, some states do have specific age restrictions.  \n\nParents can be held accountable by child welfare, child protective services organizations, or law enforcement if children come to harm while left without supervision if, in the opinion of the agency, the children's age or other considerations made such a choice inappropriate. Legal issues also continue to be important concerns for those who work in libraries. They worry about the potential liability should an unattended child be hurt, molested or abducted while at the facility. This issue becomes critical, particularly at closing time when \"parents who are late picking up their children also create safety and possibly legal problems.\" \n\nCommunity calling programs\n\nSome communities offer services through the police departments and community organizations to check in on latchkey kids. Calls can be made by community organizations or by volunteers. Automatic calling programs such as Call Reassurance  call households during the week after children arrive home and require the child to answer the phone and positively acknowledge that he or she is okay. If the call is not answered, automatic calls can likewise be sent to the parents, police, or other response centers.\nQuestion:\nThe 1940s originating term 'Latchkey child/kid' refers to a child who is often?\nAnswer:\nHome Alone House\nPassage:\nBecky Sharp\nBecky Sharp is a 1935 American historical drama film directed by Rouben Mamoulian and starring Miriam Hopkins. Other supporting cast were Frances Dee, Cedric Hardwicke, Billie Burke, Alison Skipworth, Nigel Bruce, and Alan Mowbray.\n\nThe film is based on the play of the same name by Langdon Mitchell, which in turn is based on William Makepeace Thackeray's novel Vanity Fair. The play was made famous in the late 1890s by actress Minnie Maddern Fiske. The screenplay was written by Francis Edward Faragoh. The film was considered a landmark in cinema as the first film to use the newly developed three-strip Technicolor production, opening the way for a growing number of color films to be made in Britain and the United States in the years leading up to World War II.\n\nThe film recounts the tale of a lower-class girl who insinuates herself into an upper-class family, only to see her life and the lives of those around her destroyed.\n\nPlot\n\nBecky Sharp (Miriam Hopkins), a socially ambitious English young lady manages to survive during the years following Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo.\n\nIn her efforts to advance herself, she manages to link up with a number of gentlemen: the Marquis of Steyne (Cedric Hardwicke), Joseph Sedley (Nigel Bruce), Rawdon Crawley (Alan Mowbray), and George Osborne (G. P. Huntley Jr).\n\nShe rises to the top of British society and becomes the scourge of the social circle, offending the other ladies such as Lady Bareacres (Billie Burke). Sharp falls into the humiliation of singing for her meals in a beer hall. But she never stays down for long.\n\nCast\n\n* Miriam Hopkins as Becky Sharp\n* Frances Dee as Amelia Sedley\n* Cedric Hardwicke as Marquis of Steyne\n* Billie Burke as Lady Bareacres\n* Alison Skipworth as Miss Crawley\n* Nigel Bruce as Joseph Sedley\n* Alan Mowbray as Rawdon Crawley\n* G.P.

After producing La Cucaracha, Becky Sharp, and Dancing Pirate (1936), the Whitneys and David O. Selznick formed Selznick International Pictures. Two Selznick International films, A Star Is Born and Nothing Sacred (both 1937), were produced by Selznick, copyrighted by Pioneer Pictures, and released through United Artists rather than RKO.\n\nLowell Sherman, the original director, had fallen ill while working on Night Life of the Gods before starting Becky Sharp, but had continued to work on the project; he finally died of double pneumonia four weeks into production on Sharp.\n\nAfter Sherman's  death, Rouben Mamoulian was brought in to finish the film. Mamoulian would not use any of the footage shot by Sherman, deciding instead to reshoot the entire film.\n\nColor development\n\nBecky Sharp was the first feature film to use the three-strip Technicolor process, which created a separate film register for each of the three primary colors. \n\nEarlier live action films to use the new Technicolor process include the final musical number in the feature The Cat and the Fiddle released by MGM in February 1934, and in short sequences filmed for other movies made during 1934, including The House of Rothschild (Twentieth Century Pictures/United Artists) with George Arliss and Kid Millions (Samuel Goldwyn/United Artists) with Eddie Cantor. Warner Brothers released two Leon Errol shorts, Service With a Smile (July 28, 1934) and Good Morning, Eve! (September 22, 1934), and RKO Pictures released the short La Cucaracha (August 31, 1934).\n\nReception\n\nWriting for The Spectator, Graham Greene raved that \"colour is everything here\" and characterizing its use in the film as \"a triumph\". Although Greene complained that the Technicolor \"plays havoc with the women's faces\", leveled criticism at Hopkins for her \"indecisive acting\", and noted that he had found the film's climax in Bath to be \"absurd\" and \"silly\", he described these minor complains as \"ungrateful\" and his overall impression was that the film gave \"delight to the eye\". \n\nAwards and honors\n\nWins\n* Venice Film Festival: Best Color Film, Rouben Mamoulian; 1935.\n\nNominations\n* Academy Awards: Best Actress in a Leading Role, Miriam Hopkins; 1935.\n* Venice Film Festival: Mussolini Cup, Rouben Mamoulian; 1935.\n\nPreservation status\n\nFor many years, the original three-color Technicolor version of the film was not available for viewing, though a 16 millimeter version was available. This version had been printed (poorly) on two-color Cinecolor stock which did not accurately reproduce the colors of the original film. The smaller film stock also resulted in a grainier, inferior image.\n\nIn the 1980s the UCLA Film and Television Archive restored the film, under the supervision of archivist Robert Gitt. Rouben Mamoulian appeared at the premiere of the restored print at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences theatre in Beverly Hills.\nQuestion:\nBecky Sharp is the heroine of which novel?\nAnswer:\nVanity fair (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nNoisette | Define Noisette at Dictionary.com\nNoisette | Define Noisette at Dictionary.com\nnoisette\n[nwah-zet; French nwa-zet] /nwÉËzÉt; French nwaËzÉt/\nSpell\n[nwah-zets; French nwa-zet] /nwÉËzÉts; French nwaËzÉt/ (Show IPA)\n1.\na loin, fillet, or other lean section of meat:\nan entrÃ©e of lamb noisettes.\nOrigin of noisette\nLatin\n1890-1895\n1890-95; < French: a round, rather thick slice of fillet or loin of lamb or mutton, diminutive of noix choice part of a cut of meat, literally, nut, kernel < Latin nucem, accusative of nux; see -ette\nDictionary.com Unabridged\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name for small round pieces of lamb, or chocolates with hazelnuts?\nAnswer:\nNoisett\nPassage:\nGymnophobia\nGymnophobia is a fear (phobia) of nudity.  \n\nTerminology\n\nThe term gymnophobia comes from the Greek Î³ÏÎ¼Î½ÏÏ - gumnos, \"naked\"  and  ÏÏÎ²Î¿Ï - phobos, \"fear\".  A phobia that has a significant amount of overlap with gymnophobia is dishabiliophobia, which is the fear of undressing in front of others. \n\nSymptoms\n\nGymnophobics experience anxiety from nudity, even if they realize their fear is irrational. They may worry about seeing others naked, being seen naked, or both. Their fear may stem from a general anxiety about sexuality, from a fear that they are physically inferior, or from a fear that their nakedness leaves them exposed and unprotected.  \n\nGymnophobia should not be confused with avoidance or shunning of many forms of nudity on modesty or other rational or moral grounds. Many people avoid public nudity as well as nudity in private situations, and some have an aversion to nudity as an aspect of prudishness or body shame.  \n\nGymnophobia refers to an actual fear of nudity, but most sufferers with the condition learn how to function in general society despite the condition. They may, for example, avoid  changing rooms, washrooms, showers, and beaches. However, the condition can be regarded as an anxiety disorder if the person cannot control the phobia or it is interfering with their daily life.  Gymnophobia is common among children, especially those undergoing puberty. Child gymnophobia is common due to peer pressure, bullying, and a fear of exposing sexual organs.\n\nGymnophobia has been likened to the fictional condition \"never-nude\" portrayed in the comedy series Arrested Development.\nQuestion:\nWhat is gymnophobia the fear of?\nAnswer:\nStarkers\nPassage:\nLouis RÃ©ard\nLouis RÃ©ard (1897 â 16 September 1984) was a French automobile engineer and clothes designer. He is best known for launching a two-piece swimsuit in 1946, which he called the bikini. \n\nLaunching the bikini\n\nRÃ©ard was a mechanical engineer who had taken over his mother's lingerie business in about 1940  near Les Folies BergÃ¨res in Paris and became a clothes designer. While on St. Tropez beaches, he noticed women rolling up the edges of their swimsuits to get a better tan, which inspired him to design a swimsuit with the midriff exposed. \n\nIn May 1946, Jacques Heim produced a two-piece swimsuit that he named the \"Atome,\"  which he advertised as the world's \"smallest bathing suit\".   The bottom of Heim's swimsuit was just large enough to cover the wearer's navel. To promote his new design, Heim hired skywriters to fly above the Mediterranean resort advertising the Atome as \"the worldâs smallest bathing suit.\"\n\nRÃ©ard quickly produced his own swimsuit design which was a string bikini consisting of four triangles made from only 30 sqin of fabric printed with a newspaper pattern. When RÃ©ard sought a model to wear his design at its debut presentation, none of the usual models would wear the suit, so he hired 19-year-old nude dancer Micheline Bernardini  from the Casino de Paris to model it.  He introduced his new swimsuit, which he named the bikini, to the media and public in Paris on 5 July 1946  at Piscine Molitor, a popular public pool in Paris at the time.[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?actionVideoArticle&id\n6949 Bikini Introduced], This Day in History, History Channel Not to be outdone by Heim, RÃ©ard hired his own skywriters to fly over the French Riviera advertising his design as \"smaller than the smallest bathing suit in the world.\"\n\nTwo piece swimsuits had been available for at least since the 1930s, but RÃ©ard's bikini was controversial because for the first time the wearer's navel was exposed.\n\nMarketing of the bikini\n\nThe bikini was a hit, especially among men, and Bernardini received some 50,000 fan letters. Heim's design was the first worn on the beach, but the genre of clothing was given its name by RÃ©ard. RÃ©ard's business soared, and in advertisements he kept the bikini mystique alive by declaring that a two-piece suit wasn't a genuine bikini \"unless it could be pulled through a wedding ring.\"\n\nAs a further booster for sales, RÃ©ard commissioned renowned carbody specialist Chapron to build an extravagant \"road yacht\" by converting a Packard V8 car into a mock luxury cabin cruiser complete with cockpit, portholes, anchor, signal mast and other nautical regalia. The car (not an amphibian) went on advertising parades and followed the Tour de France cycliste in the early 50's, with a crew of bikini clad girls, causing quite a sensation in period parochial France.  \n\nLater life\n\nRÃ©ard afterwards opened a bikini shop in Paris and sold swimsuits for 40 years. In 1980, RÃ©ard moved with his wife, Marcelle RÃ©ard, from France to Lausanne, Switzerland. He died in Lausanne in 1984 at the age of 87. \n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nWhich revealing item of clothing was invented by Louis Reard in 1946?\nAnswer:\nBikinis\nPassage:\nPiÃ±a colada\nThe piÃ±a colada (; , \"pineapple,\" and , \"strained\") is a sweet cocktail made with rum, coconut cream or coconut milk, and pineapple juice, usually served either blended or shaken with ice. It may be garnished with either a pineapple wedge, a maraschino cherry, or both. The piÃ±a colada has been the national drink of Puerto Rico since 1978. \n\nOrigin\n\nThe name piÃ±a colada literally means \"strained pineapple\", a reference to the freshly pressed and strained pineapple juice used in the drink's preparation.\n\nTwo bartenders from Puerto Rico won a contest for the ownership of their national drink. RamÃ³n \"Monchito\" Marrero PÃ©rez claims to have first made it at the Caribe Hilton Hotel's Beachcomber Bar in San Juan in 1954, using the then newly-available coco lÃ³pez cream of coconut. Coco lÃ³pez was developed in Puerto Rico in 1948 by Don RamÃ³n LÃ³pez-Irizarry, hence the Puerto Rican connection and the 1952 account of the drink's creation. Some say the drink did not acquire its name until the 1960s.\n\nThe Caribe Hilton Hotel sits on a 17-acre peninsula outside San Juan and was the first luxury hotel to open in the region, becoming a popular destination for the rich and famous who helped spread word of the drink.\n\nRamÃ³n Portas Mingot also says he created it in 1963 at the Barrachina Restaurant, 104 Fortaleza Street, Old San Juan.  The restaurant stands by his claim to this day.\n\nNational PiÃ±a Colada Day is celebrated on the islands on 10 July.\n\nHistory of the drink\n\nThe earliest known story states that in the 19th century, Puerto Rican pirate Roberto CofresÃ­, to boost his crew's morale, gave them a beverage or cocktail that contained coconut, pineapple and white rum.  This was what would be later known as the famous piÃ±a colada. With his death in 1825, the recipe for the piÃ±a colada was lost.\n\nRamÃ³n \"Monchito\" Marrero, a barman from the Caribe Hilton, claims to have created the PiÃ±a Colada in 1954, during his days as bartender at that resort. After three months of experimentation, Mr. Marrero finally settled upon the recipe for the PiÃ±a Colada, which he felt captured the true nature and essence of Puerto Rico. He continued to serve the drink at the Caribe Hilton for 35 years after its creation and was finally rewarded for his efforts in 1978 when Puerto Rico officially proclaimed the cocktail its national drink.\n\nCaribe Hilton possesses two proclamations that state the hotel is the \"Birthplace of the PiÃ±a Colada\". One proclamation was given by Puerto Rico Governor Sila M. CalderÃ³n in 2000, and the other was given in 2014 by Governor Alejandro GarcÃ­a Padilla as part of the PiÃ±a Colada 60th Anniversary celebrations.\n\nThe remodeled Caribe Hilton Bar, Caribar Rums & Light Bites, provides a new menu reflecting the Evolution of the PiÃ±a Colada, including a contemporary version: the Clear Colada.\n\nBarrachina, a restaurant in Puerto Rico, also claims to be the birthplace of the piÃ±a colada:In 1963, on a trip to South America, Barrachina met another popular Spaniard and bartender Ramon Portas Mingot. Don Ramon has worked with the best places in Buenos Aires and associated with \"Papillon\" the most luxurious bar in Carcao and was also recognized for his cocktail recipe books. Pepe Barrachina and Don Ramon developed a great relationship. While working as the main bartender at Barrachina (a restaurant in Puerto Rico), Ramon mixed pineapple juice, coconut cream, condensed milk and ice in a blender, creating a delicious and refreshing drink, known today as the PiÃ±a Colada.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nThis cocktail gained fame in Puerto Rico from 1978, and it gained worldwide fame after Rupert Holmes released his 1979 song, \"Escape (The PiÃ±a Colada Song)\", which became a popular hit around the world.\n\nPreparation\n\nThere are many recipes of how to make a piÃ±a colada but the one that his friends tell in the book of JosÃ© L. DÃ­az de Villegas to be the original recipe created by Monchito, is the following:\n\nVariations\n\nDifferent proportions of the core ingredients, as well as different types of rum, may all be used in the piÃ±a colada. Frozen piÃ±a coladas are also served. Other named variations include:\n* Amaretto colada â amaretto substituted for rum \n* Chi chi â with vodka in place of rum\n* Lava Flow â strawberry daiquiri and piÃ±a colada blended together \n* Staten Island Ferry â Mailbu rum and pineapple juice, over ice\n* Virgin piÃ±a colada or piÃ±ita colada â without the rum, thus non-alcoholic\n* Kiwi Colada â with kiwifruit (fruit and syrup) in place of pineapple juice\n* Variants of Blue Hawaii with creme of coconut differ from piÃ±a colada mainly by including also blue CuraÃ§ao.\nQuestion:\nThe cocktail 'Pina Colada' is made by mixing White Rum with Pineapple juice, and which other ingredient?\nAnswer:\nCoconut milk\nPassage:\nZuppa Inglese\nZuppa Inglese (; Italian for \"English soup\") is an Italian dessert layering custard and sponge cake, perhaps derived from trifle.\n\nHistory\n\nRecipes for this sweet first appeared in the towns of Parma, Bologna, ForlÃ¬, Ferrara, Florence and Reggio Emilia, all in the Emilia-Romagna or Tuscany regions, in the late nineteenth century. Its origins are uncertain and one theory states that it originated in the sixteenth century kitchens of the Dukes of Este, the rulers of Ferrara. According to this story, they asked their cooks to recreate the sumptuous \"English trifle\" they had enjoyed in England at the Elizabethan court, where they were frequent visitors.\n\nTo make Zuppa Inglese, sponge cake or ladyfingers are dipped in Alchermes, a bright red, extremely aromatic Italian herb liqueur. They are then alternated with layers of crema pasticciera, a thick egg custard cooked with a large piece of lemon zest (removed afterwards). Often there is also a layer of crema alla cioccolata made by dissolving dark chocolate in a plain crema pasticcera. In Italy it is occasionally topped with cream, meringue or almonds.\n\nZuppa Inglese is also a popular gelato flavour. \n\nName\n\nThe word \"zuppa\" in Italian cuisine refers to both sweet and savoury dishes. It comes from the verb \"inzuppare\" which means \"to dunk\". As the sponge cake or Lady fingers are dipped in liqueur the dish is called Zuppa. Similarly, thick fish, bean with vegetable stews, and fish or shellfish stews are properly described as \"zuppa di verdure\" or \"zuppa di pesce\".

Muntjacs are the oldest known deer, thought to have begun appearing 15â35 million years ago, with remains found in Miocene deposits in France, Germany  and Poland. \n\nName\n\nThe present name is a borrowing of the Latinized form of the Dutch , which was borrowed from the Sundanese mencek (). The Latin form first appeared as ' in Zimmerman in 1780.  \n\nDescription\n\nThe present-day species are native to South Asia and can be found in India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, the Indonesian islands, Taiwan and Southern China. They are also found in the lower Himalayas (Terai regions of Nepal and Bhutan) and in some areas of Japan (the Boso Peninsula and Åshima Island). They can also be found in Norfolk england.\n\nA large feral population of barking deer exists in England. Reeves's muntjac has been introduced to England, with wild deer descended from escapees from the Woburn Abbey estate around 1925.  Muntjac have expanded very rapidly, and are now present in most English counties and have also expanded their range into Wales, although they are less common in the north-west. The British Deer Society coordinated a survey of wild deer in the UK between 2005 and 2007, and they reported that muntjac deer had noticeably expanded their range since the previous census in 2000.  It is anticipated that muntjac may soon become the most numerous species of deer in England and may have also crossed the border into Scotland with a couple of specimens even appearing in Northern Ireland in 2009; they have been spotted in the Republic of Ireland in 2010, almost certainly having reached there with some human assistance.\n\nInhabiting tropical regions, the deer have no seasonal rut, and mating can take place at any time of year; this behaviour is retained by populations introduced to temperate countries. Males have short antlers, which can regrow, but they tend to fight for territory with their \"tusks\" (downward-pointing canine teeth). The presence of these \"tusks\" is otherwise unknown in native British wild deer and can be discriminatory when trying to differentiate a muntjac from an immature native deer, although water deer also have visible tusks; however, they are much less widespread.\n\nMuntjac are of great interest in evolutionary studies because of their dramatic chromosome variations and the recent discovery of several new species. The Indian muntjac (M. muntjak) is the mammal with the lowest recorded chromosome number: The male has a diploid number of 7, the female only 6 chromosomes. Reeves's muntjac (M. reevesi), in comparison, has a diploid number of 46 chromosomes. \n\nThe genus Muntiacus has 12 recognized species:\n\n* Indian muntjac or common muntjac or kakar,  Muntiacus muntjak\n* Reeves's muntjac or Chinese muntjac, M. reevesi\n* Hairy-fronted muntjac or black muntjac, M. crinifrons\n* Fea's muntjac, M.  feae\n* Bornean yellow muntjac, M.  atherodes\n* Roosevelt's muntjac, M. rooseveltorum\n* Gongshan muntjac, M. gongshanensis\n* Giant muntjac, M. vuquangensis\n* Truong Son muntjac M. truongsonensis\n* Leaf muntjac M. putaoensis\n* Sumatran muntjac M. montanus\n* Pu Hoat muntjac M. puhoatensis\nQuestion:\nA muntjac is what type of animal?\nAnswer:\nFawn\nPassage:\nPHYSICS FOLIO |authorSTREAM\nPHYSICS FOLIO  |authorSTREAM\nPHYSICS FOLIO\nÂ  Does not support media & animations\nÂ  Automatically changes to Flash or non-Flash embed\nÂ  The presentation is successfully added In Your Favorites .\nViews:\nÂ  This Presentation is Public Â  Favorites:Â \n0\nENTRY NO. 1:  Physics A Natural Philosophy:\nENTRY NO. 1:  Physics A Natural Philosophy ENTRY NO. 1:   Physics A Natural Philosophy\nPhysics A Natural Philosophy:\nPhysics A Natural Philosophy Physics as natural philosophy.

St-Laurent\nCCGS Louis S. St-Laurent is a Canadian Coast Guard Heavy Arctic Icebreaker. Louis S. St-Laurents home port is St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador  and is stationed there with other vessels of the coast guard.\n\nNamed after the twelfth Prime Minister of Canada, The Right Honourable Louis St. Laurent, PC CC QC LLD DCL LLL BA. The vessel is classed a \"Heavy Arctic Icebreaker\" and is the largest icebreaker and flagship of the CCG.\n\nOperations\n\nLouis S. St-Laurent is based at CCG Base St. John's in St. John's, Newfoundland. The vessel's current operation tempo consists of summer voyages to Canada's Arctic where she supports the annual Arctic sealift to various coastal communities and carries out multi-disciplinary scientific expeditions. During the winter months, Louis S. St-Laurent sometimes operates in the Gulf of St. Lawrence to aid ships in transiting to Montreal, Quebec, although she usually only serves this assignment during particularly heavy ice years.\n\nHistory\n\nLouis S. St. Laurent was launched 3 December 1966 by Canadian Vickers Limited at Montreal, Quebec  and commissioned in October 1969.\n\nFrom 8â22 September 1969 Louis S. St-Laurent sailed on the  expedition in the Northwest Passage. She was assisted by  and the United States Coast Guard vessels  and \n\nDuring 1976 Louis S. St-Laurent, Captain Paul M. Fournier in command, made a partial transit of the Northwest Passage traveling from east to west, through Lancaster Sound, Peel Sound, and Victoria Strait.\n\nIn 1979 Louis S. St-Laurent, Captain George Burdock in command, made a full east to west transit of the Northwest Passage. She assisted CCGS Franklin, and circumnavigated North America.\n\nLouis S. St-Laurent underwent an extensive and costly modernization at Halifax Shipyard Ltd. in Halifax, Nova Scotia between 1988-1993 which saw her hull lengthened as well as new propulsion and navigation equipment installed.\n\nThe modernization program was controversial as the government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney had initially proposed building a class of mega icebreakers (the Polar 8 Project) for promoting Canadian sovereignty in territorial waters claimed by Canada;  had made an unauthorized transit of Canada's Northwest Passage in 1985 early in Mulroney's administration, provoking a strong nationalist out-cry across the country. However, budget cuts in the late 1980s saw proposed expansions of the coast guard and armed forces scrapped. In compensation to the coast guard, the government opted to modernize the largest icebreaker in its fleet, Louis S. St-Laurent.\n\nOn 22 August 1994 Louis S. St-Laurent and USCGC Polar Sea became the first North American surface vessels to reach the North Pole.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, CBC TV's The National broadcast from Louis S. St-Laurent in a special series focused on climate change. \n\nThe vessel was originally scheduled to be decommissioned in 2000 however a refit extended the decommissioning date to 2017. In the 26 February 2008 federal budget, the Government of Canada announced it was funding a $721 million \"Polar Class Icebreaker\" (named ) as a replacement vessel for Louis S. St-Laurent.\n\nAt 1:30Â a.m. on 2 April 2015, Louis S. St-Laurent, arrived near Burgeo, Newfoundland and Labrador to take the damaged Canadian Coast Guard vessel  under tow. Ann Harvey, which had run aground near Burgeo, was already being towed by the lifeboat CCGS W.G. George when the icebreaker arrived. Louis S. St-Laurent took over the tow and brought Ann Harvery into Connoire Bay where Royal Canadian Navy divers could inspect the ship. \n\nIn 2016 Louis St. Laurent was deployed to the Arctic carrying an international team of scientists mapping the sea floor. The first leg of the mission was a voyage to Norway mapping the Atlantic. This was to be followed by a 47-day leg to the North Pole.\nQuestion:\nThe Louis S. St. Laurent' and the 'John G. Diefenbaker' are specifically what kind of ships?\nAnswer:\nIcebreakers\nPassage:\nGuanabara Bay\nGuanabara Bay (,) is an oceanic bay located in Southeast Brazil in the state of Rio de Janeiro. On its western shore lies the city of Rio de Janeiro and Duque de Caxias, and on its eastern shore the cities of NiterÃ³i and SÃ£o GonÃ§alo. Four other municipalities surround the bay's shores. Guanabara Bay is the second largest bay in area in Brazil (after the All Saints' Bay), at 412 km2, with a perimeter of 143 km.\n\nGuanabara Bay is 31 km long and 28 km wide at its maximum. Its  wide mouth is flanked at the eastern tip by the Pico do Papagaio (Parrot's Peak) and the western tip by PÃ£o de AÃ§Ãºcar (Sugar Loaf).\n\nThe name Guanabara comes from the Tupi language, goanÃ£-parÃ¡, from gwa \"bay\", plus nÃ£ \"similar to\" and ba'ra \"sea\". Traditionally, it is also translated as \"the bosom of sea.\"\n\nHistory\n\nGuanabara Bay was first encountered by Europeans on January 1, 1502, when one of the Portuguese explorers Gaspar de Lemos and GonÃ§alo Coelho  arrived on its shores. According to some historians,  the name given by the exploration team to the bay was originally Ria de Janeiro \"January Sound\", then a confusion took place between the word ria, which at the time was used to designate a bay or a sound, and rio \"river\". As a result, the name of the bay was soon fixed as Rio de Janeiro.\nLater, the city was named after the bay. Natives of the Tamoio and Tupiniquim tribes inhabited the shores of the bay.\n\nAfter the initial arrival of the Portuguese, no significant European settlements were established until French colonist and soldiers, under the Huguenot Admiral Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon invaded the region in 1555 to establish the France Antarctique. They stayed briefly on Lajes Island, then moved to Serigipe Island, near the shore, where they built Fort Coligny. After they were expelled by Portuguese military expeditions in 1563, the colonial government built fortifications in several points of Guanabara Bay, rendering it almost impregnable against a naval attack from the sea. They were the Santa Cruz, SÃ£o JoÃ£o, Lajes and Villegaignon forts, forming a fearsome crossfire rectangle of big naval guns. Other islands were adapted by the Navy to host naval storehouses, hospitals, drydocks, oil reservoirs and the National Naval Academy.\n\nDescription\n\nThere are more than 130 islands dotting the bay, including:\n* Lajes\n* Ilha do Governador â site of Rio de Janeiro's GaleÃ£o - AntÃ´nio Carlos Jobim International Airport\n* Ilha de PaquetÃ¡\n* Ilha das Cobras\n* Flores\n* Ilha Fiscal\n* Ilha da Boa Viagem\n* Villegaignon\n* FundÃ£o\n\nThe bay is crossed by the Rio-NiterÃ³i Bridge ( long and with a central span 72 m high) and there is heavy boat and ship traffic, including regular ferryboat lines. The Port of Rio de Janeiro, as well as the city's two airports, GaleÃ£o - AntÃ´nio Carlos Jobim International Airport (on Governador Island) and Santos Dumont Airport (on reclaimed land next to downtown Rio), are located on its shores. The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro main campus is located on the artificial FundÃ£o Island. A maze of smaller bridges interconnect the two largest islands, FundÃ£o and Governador, to the mainland.\n\nThere is an Environmental Protection Area (APA), which is located mostly in the municipality of Guapimirim and given the name of Guapimirim APA.\n\nEnvironment\n\nGuanabara Bay's once rich and diversified ecosystem has suffered extensive damage in recent decades, particularly along its mangrove areas.  The bay has been heavily impacted by urbanization, deforestation, and pollution of its waters with sewage, garbage, and oil spills.  As of 2014, more than 70% of the sewage from 12 million inhabitants of Rio de Janeiro now flows into the bay untreated. \n\nThere have been three major oil spills in Guanabara Bay. The most recent was in 2000 when a leaking underwater pipeline released  of oil into the bay, destroying large swaths of the mangrove ecosystem. Recovery measures are currently being attempted, but more than a decade after the incident, the mangrove areas have not returned to life.\n\nOne of the world's largest landfills is located at Jardim Gramacho adjacent to Guanabara Bay. It was closed in 2012 after 34 years of operation. The landfill attracted attention from environmentalists and it supported 1700 people scavenging for recyclable materials. \n\nAs part of the preparations for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, the government was supposed to improve the conditions, but progress has been slow. There have been concerns that the efforts may only be short-term and abandoned following the Games, as there would be little political incentive to continue with them. \n\nIn June 2014 Dutch windsurfer and former Olympic and world champion Dorian van Rijsselberghe made an urgent appeal to  government and industry in The Netherlands to collaborate in cleaning up the bay, together with the Plastic Soup Foundation.   The Dutch government picked up the message and formulated a Clean Urban Delta Initiative Rio de Janeiro  together with a consortium of Dutch industry, knowledge institutes and NGOs which will be presented to the Brazilian authorities in the State of Rio de Janeiro.\nQuestion:\nThe most visited city in the western hemisphere stands on Guanabara Bay. What is it?\nAnswer:\nSÃ£o SebastiÃ£o do Rio de Janeiro\nPassage:\nClaret Jug\nThe Golf Champion Trophy, commonly known as the Claret Jug, is the trophy presented to the winner of The Open Championship, (often called the \"British Open\"), one of the four major championships in golf.\n\nThe awarding of the Claret Jug dates from 1872, when a new trophy was needed after Young Tom Morris had won the original Challenge Belt (presented by Prestwick Golf Club) outright in 1870 by winning the Championship three years in a row. Prestwick had both hosted and organised the Championship from 1860 to 1870.\n\nBy the time that Prestwick had reached agreement with the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews and the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers (based at Musselburgh) for the championship to rotate at these three venues, more than a year had passed. So, there was no event in 1871.\n\nEach club contributed Â£10 to the cost of the new trophy, which is inscribed 'The Golf Champion Trophy', and was made by Mackay Cunningham & Company of Edinburgh.\n\nWhen the 1872 event was played, the trophy still wasn't ready in time to be presented to Morris (who had won his fourth in a row) although his name was the first to be engraved on it. In 1872, Morris was presented with a medal as have all subsequent winners.\n\nIn 1873 Tom Kidd became the first winner to be actually presented with the Claret Jug after winning the Championship.\n\nThe original Claret Jug has been on permanent display at the clubhouse of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews since 1928. The original Challenge Belt is also on display at the same site, having been donated in 1908 by the Morris family.\n\nThe current Claret Jug was first awarded to Walter Hagen for winning the 1928 Open. The winner must return the trophy before the next year's Open, and receives a replica to keep permanently. Three other replicas exist â one in the British Museum of Golf at St Andrews, and two used for travelling exhibitions.\n\nEvery year, the winner's name is engraved on the Claret Jug before it is presented to him. The BBC always shows the engraver poised to start work, and the commentators like to speculate about when he will be sure enough of the outcome to begin. However, at the 1999 Open Championship, Jean van de Velde's name was engraved on the trophy before he famously choked with a triple-bogey on the 18th hole and Paul Lawrie subsequently won the playoff. Upon being awarded the Jug in 1989, Mark Calcavecchia said, \"How's my name going to fit on that thing?\" \n\nThe Claret Jug has twice appeared on commemorative Â£5 Scottish banknotes issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland: first in 2004, for the 250th Anniversary of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, then in 2005, the jug is shown held by Jack Nicklaus to mark his retirement.\nQuestion:\nThe Claret Jug is the name of the trophy awarded to the winner of which annual sporting championship?\nAnswer:\nOpen Golf Championship\nPassage:\nClaymore\nA claymore (; from Scottish Gaelic claidheamh-mÃ²r, \"great sword\")  refers either to the Scottish variant of the late medieval two-handed sword or the Scottish variant of the basket-hilted sword. The former is characterised as having a cross hilt of forward-sloping quillons with quatrefoil terminations and was in use from the 15th to 17th centuries.\n\nThe word claymore was first used in reference to swords in the 18th century in Scotland and parts of England to refer to basket-hilted swords. This description was maybe not used during the 17th century, when basket hilted swords were the primary military swords across Europe, but these broad-bladed swords remained in service with Scottish regiments for some time longer. After the Acts of Union in 1707 when Scottish and English regiments were integrated together, the swords were seen as a mark of distinction by Scottish officers over the more slender sabres used by their English contemporaries: a symbol of physical strength and prowess, and a link to the historic Highland way of life. Such swords remained in service with Scottish regiments into the 19th century.\n\nTerminology\n\nThe term claymore is an anglicisation of the Gaelic claidheamh-mÃ³r \"great sword\", attested in 1772 (as Cly-more) with the gloss \"great two-handed sword\".  The sense \"basket-hilted sword\" is contemporaneous, attested in 1773 as \"The broad-sword now used [...] called the Claymore, (i.e., the great sword).\"  OED observes that the latter usage is \"inexact, but very common\". The 1911 EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica likewise judged that the term is \"wrongly\" applied to the basket-hilted sword.\n\nCountering this view, Paul Wagner & Christopher Thompson argue that the term \"claymore\" was applied first to the basket-hilted broadsword, and then to all Scottish swords. They provide earlier quotes than those given above, in support of its use to refer to a basket-hilted broadsword and targe: \"a strong handsome target, with a sharp pointed steel, of above half an ell in length, screw'd into the navel of it, on his left arm, a sturdy claymore by his side\" (1715 pamphlet). They also note its use as a battle-cry as early as 1678. \n\nAuthors arguing that the basket-hilted sword is \"incorrectly\" called claymore have been known to suggest that claybeg (from a purported Gaelic claidheamh-beag \"small sword\") should be used instead.  This term is not seen in clan-era Gaelic song or poetry, Dwelly's [ibid.], or other authorities, and seems to be a fairly recent invention.\n\nThis does not parallel Scottish Gaelic usage. According to the Gaelic Dictionary by R. A. Armstrong (1825), claidheamh-mÃ²r translates to \"broadsword\", and claidheamh dÃ  lÃ imh to \"two-handed sword\", while claidheamh-beag is given as a translation of \"Bilbo\". \n\nThe term \"claymore\" became part of vocabulary of the Victorian era sentimental or Romanticist \"retro-Jacobite\" literature and poetry such as the Skye Boat Song (1870).\n\nOther contemporary Gaelic descriptives of swords include claidheamh-cÃ¹il or back sword, referring to a single-edged sword with a flat \"spine\" (not one worn on the back, a common misinterpretation), the claidheamh-crom or crooked sword, which could describe either a typical sabre-style blade (such as that worn by Archibald Campbell, 1st Duke of Argyll, in the painting by Medina) or a scimitar style blade known as a \"Turcael\" (\"Turkish\" blade) such as that brandished by Alasdair MÃ²r, the Champion of Clan Grant, in the c. 1715 portrait by Waitt, or the claidheamh-caol or narrow sword, usually describing a rapier or small-sword.\n\nTwo-handed (Highland) claymore\n\nThe two-handed claymore was a large sword used in the late Medieval and early modern periods. It was used in the constant clan warfare and border fights with the English from circa 1400 to 1700.  Although Claymores existed as far back as the Wars of Scottish Independence they were smaller and few had the typical quatrefoil design (as can be seen on the Great Seal of John Balliol King of Scots).  The last known battle in which it is considered to have been used in a significant number was the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689.  It was somewhat longer than other two-handed swords of the era. The two-handed claymore seems to be an offshoot of Early Scottish medieval longswords (similar to the Espee de Guerre or Grete war sword) which had developed a distinctive style of a cross-hilt with forward-angled arms that ended in spatulate swellings.The lobed pommels on earlier swords were inspired by the Viking style. The spatulate swellings were later frequently made in a quatrefoil design. \n\nThe average claymore ran about 140Â cm (55Â in) in overall length, with a 33Â cm (13Â in) grip, 107Â cm (42Â in) blade, and a weight of approximately 5.5Â lb (2.5Â kg). For instance, in 1772 Thomas Pennant described a sword seen on his visit to Raasay as: \"an unwieldy weapon, two inches broad, doubly edged; the length of the blade three feet seven inches; of the handle, fourteen inches; of a plain transverse guard, one foot; the weight six pounds and a half.\" \n\nFairly uniform in style, the sword was set with a wheel pommel often capped by a crescent-shaped nut and a guard with straight, forward-sloping arms ending in quatrefoils, and langets running down the centre of the blade from the guard. Another common style of two-handed claymore (though lesser known today) was the \"clamshell hilted\" claymore. It had a crossguard that consisted of two downward-curving arms and two large, round, concave plates that protected the foregrip. It was so named because the round guards resembled an open clam.\n\nIn Popular Culture\n\n* Ween references the claymore in the opening lines of the song The Blarney Stone (Song) off the album The Mollusk\nQuestion:\nBroad, Claymore, and Epee are types of what?\nAnswer:\nTalon (robot)\nPassage:\nA Chorus of Disapproval (play)\nA Chorus of Disapproval is a 1984 play written by English playwright Alan Ayckbourn.\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe story follows a young widower, Guy Jones, as he joins an amateur operatic society that is putting on The Beggar's Opera. He rapidly progresses through the ranks to become the male lead, while simultaneously conducting liaisons with several of the female cast. Many of the songs from The Beggar's Opera are kept within the play, usually being sung with their own, new context.\n\nFirst productions\n\nAyckbourn wrote the work for the 1984 summer season at his Stephen Joseph Theatre, Scarborough, where it opened on 2 May. Peter Hall, director of the National Theatre, London, had expressed an interest in the piece and Ayckbourn modified his initial concept  to suit an eventual large-scale production; on 1 August 1985 it opened in the National's Olivier auditorium, with Ayckbourn directing, Michael Gambon playing amateur director Dafydd Llewellyn and Bob Peck as newcomer Guy Jones. The female leads were Gemma Craven, Imelda Staunton and Kelly Hunter. \n\nFilm adaptation\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the play A Chorus of Disapproval?\nAnswer:\nAlan Ayckbourne\nPassage:\nKeith Relf\nWilliam Keith Relf (22 March 1943 â 14 May 1976) was an English musician, best known as the lead vocalist and harmonica player for The Yardbirds.\n\nMusical career\n\nRelf started playing in bands around the summer of 1956 as a singer, guitarist, and harmonica player. Despite his suffering from respiratory problems, his blues harp was a key part of the Yardbirds' sound and success, according to many, and his vocals may have been as important a contribution to the band,  as that of their three lead guitarists Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Jimmy Page - who were augmented by bassist Paul Samwell-Smith, guitarist/bassist Chris Dreja, and drummer Jim McCarty.\n\nRelf co-wrote many of the original Yardbirds songs (\"Shapes of Things\", \"I Ain't Done Wrong\", \"Over Under Sideways Down\", \"Happenings Ten Years Time Ago\"), later showing a leaning towards acoustic/folk music as the sixties unfolded (\"Only the Black Rose\").  He also sang an early version of \"Dazed and Confused\" in live Yardbirds concerts, a song later recorded by the band's successor group Led Zeppelin. \n\nHis debut solo single, \"Mr. Zero\", peaked at No.Â 50 in the UK Singles Chart in May 1966. \n\nAfter The Yardbirds broke up in July 1968, Relf formed the acoustic duo Together, with fellow Yardbird Jim McCarty, followed immediately by Renaissance (which also featured his sister Jane Relf).  After leaving Renaissance in 1970, he started producing other artists: Steamhammer, folk-rock band Hunter Muskett, the acoustic world music group Amber, psychedelic band Saturnalia,  and blues-rock band Medicine Head (with whom he also played bass guitar).  In 1974, he formed progressive/rock group Armageddon - their self-titled debut, Armageddon, was recorded in England and released in the United States on A&M Records. The album's original liner notes used the term \"supergroup\"; their personnel (besides Relf) included drummer Bobby Caldwell (previously a member of Captain Beyond and Johnny Winter's band), guitarist Martin Pugh (from Steamhammer, The Rod Stewart Album, and later of 7th Order),  and bassist Louis Cennamo (also formerly of Renaissance and Steamhammer). \n\nPersonal life and death\n\nIn 1966, he married April Liversidge.  They had two sons, Danny and Jason. \n\nRelf was 33 when he died from electrocution, in the basement of his home, while playing his improperly earthed (electrically grounded) guitar. Relf had dealt with several health issues throughout his life, including emphysema and asthma, which may have contributed to his inability to survive the electric shock.  At the time, it is said that Relf was in the process of putting back together the original Renaissance line-up â which would eventually be called Illusion.  He was buried in Richmond Cemetery. \n\nLegacy\n\nRelf's posthumous 1992 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction with the Yardbirds was represented by his widow April, and sons Danny and Jay. \n\nSolo singles discography\n\nMost of Relf's recordings were released under the name of the group he was in at the time. However, an early attempt was made to establish him as a solo artist and two singles came out under his own name in 1966. \n\n* \"Mr. Zero\" / \"Knowing\" â UK Columbia DB7920 / U.S. Epic 10044 â May 1966 \n:A-side written by Bob Lind\n* \"Shapes In My Mind\" / \"Blue Sands\" â UK Columbia DB8084 / US Epic 10110 â November 1966 \n:B-side is an instrumental credited to Relf, but actually performed by The Outsiders (not to be confused with the US band, The Outsiders, who performed \"Time Won't Let Me\"). The US single featured the same version as the UK single, US promotional copies (on red vinyl) featured a complete re-edit of the song\n\nA further single appeared in 1989:\n* \"Together Now\" / \"All The Fallen Angels\" â MCCM 89 002 â 1989 \n:US release only.  The A-side was recorded in 1968, originally recorded that year by Together. The B-side was recorded on 2 May 1976, 12 days before Relf's death\nQuestion:\nKeith Relf was the singer with which 1960s group, three of their guitarists are some of the most famous in rock music?\nAnswer:\nThe Yard Birds\nPassage:\nRichard Schirrmann\nRichard Schirrmann (15 May 1874 â 14 December 1961) was a German teacher and founder of the first youth hostel.\n\nBorn in Grunenfeld (today GronÃ³wko), Province of Prussia as the son of a teacher, Schirrmann studied to become a teacher himself. In 1895, he received his qualification, and was sent to Altena, Westphalia in 1903. In 1907, he first published his idea of an inexpensive accommodation for young people, after he noticed the lack of such places on a school trip when he had to spend the night in barns or village school buildings. Schirrmann received considerable support and donations, and in 1912 he opened the first youth hostel in the recently reconstructed Altena castle.\n\nSchirrmann described a Western Front Christmas Truce in December 1915:\n\n\"When the Christmas bells sounded in the villages of the Vosges behind the lines .. something fantastically unmilitary occurred. German and French troops spontaneously made peace and ceased hostilities; they visited each other through disused trench tunnels, and exchanged wine, cognac and cigarettes for Westphalian black bread, biscuits and ham. This suited them so well that they remained good friends even after Christmas was over.\n\nSchirrmann served in a regiment holding a position on the Bernhardstein, one of the mountains of the Vosges - separated from the French troops by a narrow no-manâs-land, which his account describes as \"strewn with shattered trees, the ground ploughed up by shellfire, a wilderness of earth, tree-roots and tattered uniforms\". Military discipline was soon restored, but Schirrmann pondered over the incident, wondering whether \"thoughtful young people of all countries could be provided with suitable meeting places where they could get to know each other\".\n\nGerman Youth Hostel Association\n\nIn 1919, he founded a nationwide youth hostel association, and in 1922, he retired from teaching to focus entirely on the youth-hostel movement. From 1933 to 1936, he also served as President of the International Youth Hostelling Association (now Hostelling International), before the Nazi government forced him to resign. After the Second World War, he worked on the rebuilding of the German association, for which he received the Bundesverdienstkreuz in 1952.\n\nSchirrmann died in GrÃ¤venwiesbach (Taunus) in 1961.\nQuestion:\nWhich movement was begun in 1909 by Richard Schirrmann, a German schoolteacher, and Wilhelm Mnker, a conservationist?\nAnswer:\nBackpacker lodges\nPassage:\nKing's Road\nKing's Road or Kings Road (or sometimes The King's Road, especially when it was the King's private road until 1830), is a major street stretching through Chelsea and Fulham, both in west London. It is associated with 1960s style, and fashion figures such as Mary Quant and Vivienne Westwood. Sir Oswald Mosley's Blackshirt movement had a barracks on the street in the 1930s. \n\nLocation\n\nKing's Road  runs for just under 2 mi through Chelsea, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, from Sloane Square in the east (on the border with Belgravia and Knightsbridge) and through the Moore Park estate on the border of Chelsea and Fulham opposite Stamford Bridge. Shortly after crossing Stanley bridge the road passes a slight kink at the junction with Waterford Road in Fulham, where it then becomes New King's Road, continuing to Fulham High Street and Putney Bridge; its western end is in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham.\n\nHistory\n\nKing's Road derives its name from its function as a private road used by King Charles II to travel to Kew. It remained a private royal road until 1830, but people with connections were able to use it. Some houses date from the early 18th century. No. 213 has a blue plaque to film director Sir Carol Reed, who lived there from 1948 until his death in 1978. Thomas Arne lived at No. 215 and is believed to have composed \"Rule Britannia\" there. Ellen Terry lived in the same house from 1904â1920, and also Peter Ustinov; the house is commemorated by a blue plaque also. Photographer Christina Broom was born in 1862 at No 8.\n\nIn 1876, the world's first artificial ice rink, the Glaciarium, opened just off King's Road, and later that year it relocated to a building on the street.\n\nDuring the 1960s the street became a symbol of mod culture, evoking \"an endless frieze of mini-skirted, booted, fair-haired angular angels\", one magazine later wrote.  King's Road was home in the 1960s to the Chelsea Drugstore (originally a chemist with a stylised chrome-and-neon soda fountain upstairs, later a public house, and more recently a McDonalds), and in the 1970s  to Malcolm McLaren's boutique, Let It Rock, which was renamed SEX in 1974, and then Seditionaries in 1977. During the hippie and punk eras, it was a centre for counterculture, but has since been gentrified. It serves as Chelsea's high street and has a reputation for being one of London's most fashionable shopping streets.  Other celebrated boutiques included Granny Takes a Trip, The Sweet Shop in Blantyre Street just off King's Road at World's End and Stop The Shop, a fashion boutique with a revolving floor.\n\n484 King's Road was the headquarters of Swan Song Records, owned by Led Zeppelin.  They left following closure of the company in 1983. King's Road was site of the first UK branch of Starbucks which opened in 1999.\n\n535 King's Road was the headquarters of Cube Records, a late 1960s and early 1970s independent record label. The label folded in the mid 1970s, becoming part of Elektra Records. The building has since been demolished but the new building on the same site still houses a record company.\n\nThe road has been represented in popular culture on various occasions: \"King's Road\" is the title of a song by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers from the 1981 album Hard Promises and is name-checked in the song \"Dick a Dum Dum (King's Road)\" which was a hit for Des O'Connor in 1969. In Ian Fleming's novels, James Bond lives in a fashionable unnamed square just off King's Road.\n\nPlanning and transport\n\n;Planning\nThe eastern part of King's Road is identified in the London Plan as one of 35 major centres in Greater London.\n\n;Bus\nBuses 11, 19, 22, 49, 211, 319, 328, and C3 all go down King's Road, yet most of these turn off the street at one point or another. The 11 and the 22 are the only routes which run the entirety of King's Road, with the 22 being the only route that runs all the way from Sloane Square to the end of New King's Road in Fulham.\n\n;Rail and Tube\nThe western end of King's Road is close to Imperial Wharf railway station on the London Overground network, with connections to Willesden Junction and Clapham Junction. Southern also run direct rail services to  and  from this station. At the eastern end of the street is Sloane Square, and Fulham Broadway lies at the western end, on the boundary between Chelsea and Fulham. King's Road, and the area of Chelsea as a whole, is known for having poor links to the London Underground. Due to this, the route of Crossrail 2 is proposed to have an underground station in this area, called King's Road Chelsea.\n\n;River\nChelsea Harbour Pier is also within easy reach of the western end of King's Road, with river bus services provided by London River Services and Thames Executive Charters to Putney and Blackfriars. Further east, the same services are also provided at Cadogan Pier, only a few blocks south of King's Road near the Albert Bridge.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of Vivienne Westwood's clothes shop at 430 King's Road where she sells her Anglomania label?\nAnswer:\nWorld's End Park\nPassage:\nBunny Hoest\nBunny Hoest (born 1932), sometimes labeled The Cartoon Lady, is the writer of several cartoon series, including The Lockhorns, Laugh Parade and Howard Huge, all of which she inherited from her late husband Bill Hoest.King Features: Bunny Hoest She is the co-creator of Bumper Snickers in 1974, Agatha Crumm in 1977, Laugh Parade in 1980, Howard Huge in 1981, What A Guy! in 1986 and Hunny Bunny's Short Tales in 1992.\n\nBorn in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, as Madeline Mezz, she was the only child of a doctor and an opera singer. She received the nickname \"Bunny\" as a child, as she recalled, \"My mother and father called me Bunny from day one. They said I was little and cute and had dark eyes like a little bunny.\" Her father, Dr. David Mezz, was a surgeon who invented the nose clip used by springboard divers. [http://www.claudiacopquin.com/news.php?wgo\n1 Copquin, Claudia Gryvatz. \"Bunny Hoest: Life On and Off the Funny Pages,\" Newsday, August 2,, 2008. ] \n\nAfter attending a magnet school as a music student for four years, she graduated in 1953 from Adelphi University, where she studied literature and creative writing, noting, âI feel that writing is a gift which should be perfected. English is a beautiful language. Why muck it up?â[http://alumni.adelphi.edu/hoest_profile.php Adelphi University: Alumni Profiles]\n\nWhen she was 19, she married Ted Jungreis, and the couple moved to Huntington, Long Island, where she raised three children. With a master's degree in secondary education from C. W. Post, she taught English as a second language. She joined a local community theater, where she composed original scores for three musical comedies, in addition to singing, dancing and directing the music in productions of Gypsy, Damn Yankees, Guys and Dolls, South Pacific and other musical comedies. During this time, she also became a member of the Huntington Choral Society.\n\nCartoon connection\n\nThe couple separated after 21 years together, and not long after that, she landed a job with cartoonist Bill Hoest, creator of The Lockhorns, who needed an assistant to help compile his cartoons into books. She recalled, \"I was 40 years old. My kids were 20, 18 and 15.\" Hoest, who had six children, was also recently divorced. The two married in 1973. She reflected, \"Marrying Bill meant taking on a whole different kind of life, a new direction with much responsibility. He needed a working partner as well as a marriage partner. It was scary and challenging. I thought, what the hell, I'll give it a shot.\"\n\nSoon she was writing captions for The Lockhorns, and eventually they worked together on the scripts for their other features. After Bill Hoest's death in 1988, she continued the cartoons and strips, working closely with illustrator John Reiner, who began as Bill Hoest's assistant in 1986. They usually work three or four months in advance of publication.\n\nIn 1996, she met and married Dr. Walter T. Carpenter, Jr., who died on October 23, 2008, at the age of 97. \n\nHer daughter is Sharon Bowers, who collaborated with Adrian Sinnott on Hunny Bunnyâs Short Tale, brief bedtime stories for kids. Syndicated by King Features in the mid to late-1990s, the feature was one of the first panel cartoons delivered electronically.\n\nParade of laughter\n\nIn 2001, Marcelle S. Fischer, in The New York Times, profiled Long Island's cartoonists, including Bunny Hoest: \nBunny Hoest writes the snappy one-liners for The Lockhorns, a cartoon panel about a bickering long-married couple that appears in 500 newspapers. \"Be careful,\" Ms. Hoest said. \"I'm just writing what I see. It's based on observation.\" Ms. Hoest's strip is drawn by John Reiner, who took over when her husband, the artist Bill Hoest, got cancer in 1986. He died in 1988. Some comics are done by teams: writers create the dialogue and storyline; illustrators sketch the panels and strips in pencil. Inkers retrace the drawing. Then the lettering is done. \n\nAccording to King Features, Bunny Hoest had 200 million readers each week, a total derived from The Lockhorns (500 newspapers worldwide), Laugh Parade (80 million readers each Sunday) and the long-running Bumper Snickers for The National Enquirer (which has a circulation of more than seven million). Bumper Snickers began in 1974 and was collected in a Signet paperback two years later.\n\nLiving in Lloyd Neck, Long Island, she plays tennis and continues to sing with the Huntington Choral Society. She has six grandchildren and many stepchildren and step-grandchildren.\nQuestion:\nAppearing in Parade magazine since 1980, what is the name of the single panel comic strip, inked by Bunny Hoest and John Reiner, that features pleasant, likable Saint Bernard, who by his very size, gets in the way of the family he lives with?\nAnswer:\nHoward Huge\n\n\nPassage:\nHenry Bessemer - The Steel Man - Inventors\nHenry Bessemer - The Steel Man\nHenry Bessemer - The Steel Man\nHenry Bessemer - The Steel Man\nHenry Bessemer and the Production of Steel\nBy Mary Bellis\nUpdated August 18, 2016.\nSir Henry Bessemer, an Englishman, invented the first process for mass-producingÂ steelÂ inexpensively in the 19th century. It was an essential contribution to the development of modern day skyscrapers.\nThe First System for Manufacturing Steel\nAn American, William Kelly, initially held a patent for \"a system of air blowing the carbon out of pig iron,\" a method of steel production known as the pneumatic process. Air was blown through molten pig iron to oxidize and remove unwanted impurities.\nThis was Bessemerâs starting point. When Kelly went bankrupt, Bessemer â who had been working on a similar process for making steel â bought his patent. Bessemer patented \"a decarbonization process utilizing a blast of air\" in 1855.\nModern Steel\nModern steel is made using technology based on Bessemer's process. On the making of the first steel ingot, Bessemer said:\n\"I well remember how anxiously I awaited the blowing of the first 7-cwt. charge of pig iron. I had engaged an ironfounder's furnace attendant to manage the cupola and the melting of the charge. When his metal was nearly all melted, he came to meÂ and said hurriedly, \"Where be going to put the metal, maister?\" I said, \"I want you to run it by a gutter into that little furnace,\" pointing to the converter, \"from which you have just raked out all the fuel, and then I shall blow cold air through it to make it hot.\"\nThe man looked at me in a way in which surprise and pity for my ignorance seemed curiously blended, andÂ he said, \"It will soon be all of a lump.\" Notwithstanding this prediction, the metal was run in, and I awaited with much impatience the result. The first element attacked by the atmospheric oxygen is the silicon, generally present in pig iron to the extent of 1 1/2 to 2 percent; it is the white metallic substance of which flint is the acid silicate. Its combustion furnishes a great deal of heat, but it is very undemonstrative, a few sparks and hot gases only indicating the fact that something is going quietly on.\nBut after an interval of 10 or 12 minutes, when the carbon contained in grey pig iron to the extent of about 3 percent is seized on by the oxygen, a voluminous white flame is produced which rushes out of the openings provided for its escape from the upper chamber, and it brilliantly illuminates the whole space around. This chamber proved a perfect cure for the rush of slags and metal from the upper central opening of the first converter. I watched with some anxiety for the expected cessation of the flame as the carbon gradually burnt out. It took place almost suddenly, and thus indicated the entire decarburisation of the metal.\nThe furnace was then tapped, when out rushed a limpid stream of incandescent malleable iron, almost too brilliant for the eye to rest upon. It was allowed to flow vertically into the parallel undivided ingot mould. Then came the question, would the ingot shrink enough, and the cold iron mould expand enough, to allow the ingot to be pushed out? An interval of eight or 10 minutes was allowed, and then, on the application of hydraulic force to the ram, the ingot rose entirely out of the mould and stood there ready for removal.\"\nBessemer was knighted in 1879 for his contributions to science. The \"Bessemer Process\" for mass-producing steel was named after him.\nRobert Mushet is credited with inventing tungsten steel in 1868, and Henry Brearly invented stainless steel in 1916.\nQuestion:\nWhich metal is produced by the Bessemer Process?\nAnswer:\n", "input_tokens": 14680}

In other words, how many non-repeating paragraphs are there in total?\n\nParagraph 1: From 1886, Worthington began to acquire public houses, which provided a captive market for their product. In order to raise capital for this expansion, the firm became a public company in 1889, and Horace Brown was created joint managing director alongside William Posnette Manners (1846â1915). By this time the company had an annual output of around 200,000 barrels, and employed 470 people. By 1890, the company's bottling operations equalled those of Bass, Guinness, Allsopp and Whitbread. When William Henry Worthington (1826â1894) died he left no direct heirs and was the fourth and final generation of the family to manage Worthington & Co. Horace Brown left the company in 1894 following a dispute with co-manager William Manners. By 1900, 73 per cent of the company's equity was in the hands of William Posnette Manners, who had joined the company in 1862 as a junior clerk, and under his astute leadership Worthington acquired a reputation for the quality of its bottled pale ales. The company acquired the Burton Brewery Company in 1915. On Manners' death in 1915, control of the company passed to two of his sons, Arthur (1879â1968) and Ernest. Arthur was the architect of the merger with archrival Bass in 1927, and proved to be more than a match for John Gretton, 1st Baron Gretton, the chairman of the much larger Bass. Despite Bass's superior capitalization, the terms of the merger were such that Manners became chairman and joint managing director of Worthington, and deputy chairman and joint managing director of Bass. The amalgamation, described as 'the biggest non-merger in the history of the brewing industry', failed to realize its objectives. Apart from greater co-operation in bottled beer production and distribution, there were few economies and the two companies continued to operate as separate entities. Both boards were increasingly dominated by Manners and his family.\n\nParagraph 2: USÂ 1 Bus./USÂ 23 Bus./SRÂ 4 Bus. begins at an intersection with USÂ 1/USÂ 23/SRÂ 4 (known as Memorial Drive south of this intersection and South Georgia Parkway west of it) and USÂ 82/SRÂ 520 (also known as South Georgia Parkway). The business routes travel northwest on Memorial Drive. The green traffic island on the north-northeast of the intersection is named the Millie DeShazo Triangle. They extend into the heart of Waycross, while the mainline route of USÂ 1/USÂ 23/SRÂ 4 heads west across the southern portion of the city. They immediately curve to the west-northwest and begin paralleling CSX Transportation's Brunswick Subdivision. Just past Harrison Street, they pass Memorial Stadium. On a curve to a nearly due west direction, they leave the CSX Transportation tracks and cross over the city drainage canal. They curve to the northwest and travel under a railroad bridge for CSX Transportation's Jesup Subdivision. Immediately after this bridge is an intersection with USÂ 84/SRÂ 38 (Plant Avenue) and the eastern terminus of Carswell Avenue. The business routes turn to the right and travel northeast on a concurrency with USÂ 84/SRÂ 38 for approximately . The five highways immediately begin paralleling the Jesup Subdivision and pass an office of the Georgia Department of Labor. USÂ 1 Bus./USÂ 23 Bus./SRÂ 4 Bus. then turns left onto State Street, also signed as Ossie Davis Parkway, and travel to the northwest. They curve to the north-northwest and pass Wacona Elementary School. An intersection with Tebeau Street leads to a Mayo Clinic hospital. The three highways curve to the north-northwest. Between Charlton and Clough streets, the southbound lanes meet the northern terminus of Johnson Avenue, a one-way street, at a partial interchange. Just north of Abner Street, they begin paralleling another CSX Transportation rail line, specifically the Fitzgerald Subdivision. They cross over Kettle Creek, where they leave the city limits of Waycross. They curve to the west-northwest and leave the rail line. An intersection with the northern terminus of Airport road leads to the Erin Johnson Softball Complex, Ware State Prison, St. Illa Substance Abuse Center, the Ware County Sheriff's Office, and the Southland Waste Transfer Station. This intersection is just north of WaycrossâWare County Airport. They continue in a northwesterly direction and then reach their northern terminus, a second intersection with the USÂ 1/USÂ 23/SRÂ 4 mainline. Except for the far northern end, the entire length of USÂ 1 Bus. is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense.\n\nParagraph 3: The existing specimens of Orthosuchus were found in the Lower Jurassic Red Bed Formation in South Africa in 1963. It was hypothesized that Orthosuchus lived mainly on terrestrial land, but some key factors contribute to the fact that it spent time mostly in water. The first notable evidence is on the palate, which was covered by soft tissue, not bone. The choanae are on the back of the palate and a valve was used to help close the glottis. These features help Orthosuchus keep breathing when submerging in the aquatic system. The ears are protected by earflaps, which prevent water inflow to the otic recess when this animal is in water. Modern crocodiles also have earflaps to decrease water entry. The shape of the skull, especially the snout, is similar to an Indian gharial, Gavialis gangeticus, who prey on small fish. It is possible that Orthosuchus has the same predation, by slowly moving toward schools of small fish and swallow from the side. The aquatic environment provides plenty of food for the animal, besides small fish, the animal could also feed on lake invertebrates. Orthosuchus has a small salt-secreting gland, which indicates that it is not a marine animal. And because the pubis articulates with the front region of the ischium, it is believed to be a basal animal that lived in swamps and lakes. The animal is probably quadrupedal because the fore limbs are approximately 91% the length of the hind limb, which also makes the walking on land easier. Unlike modern crocodiles, Orthosuchus does not creep on its belly; it probably walks at a high position with its femur vertical to the ground. According to Parrish, primitive crocodylomorphs did not have a crawling stance because it was more used to the terrestrial environment. However, Orthosuchus may not be a good swimmer, since it has amphicoelous vertebrae, whereas modern crocodiles have procoelous vertebrae, which increase the mobility of the tail.\n\nParagraph 4: In 1658, a French Capuchin monastery was founded by the site; in 1669 the monastery succeeded in purchasing the monument, which by the early 19th century was being used as the monastery library. The monument was popularly known as the \"Lantern of Demosthenes\" or \"Lantern of Diogenes\", although a reading of its inscription by Jacob Spon had established its original purpose.  The young British architects James \"Athenian\" Stuart and Nicholas Revett published the first measured drawings of the monument in their Antiquities of Athens (London 1762). The monument became famous in France and England through engravings of it, and contemporary versions of it became eye-catching features in several English landscape gardens. Lord Byron stayed at the monastery  during his second visit to Greece. In 1818, friar Francis planted in its gardens the first tomato plants in Greece. In 1821 the convent was burned by the Ottomans during the Greek War of Independence, and subsequently demolished, and the monument was inadvertently exposed to the weather. In 1829, the monks offered the structure to an Englishman on tour, but it proved to be too cumbersome to disassemble and ship. Lord Elgin negotiated unsuccessfully for the monument, by then an icon in the Greek Revival.\n\nParagraph 5: Sparky the Sun Devil is the official mascot of Arizona State University. Originally the ASU athletic teams' mascot was an owl, then became a \"Normal\" (because ASU was founded as a normal school). It was later changed to a bulldog in an attempt to make the school â Arizona State Teacher's College at the time â appear more in line with Yale and other universities that held a higher level of respect. The State Press, the student newspaper, ran frequent appeals during the fall of 1946, urging the Bulldog to be replaced by the new Sun Devil. On November 8, 1946, the student body voted 819 to 196 to make the change. On November 20, as reported by the Arizona Republic, the student council made it official. The following day, the first Arizona State team played as the Sun Devils.  Two years later, Stanford Alum and Disney illustrator Berk Anthony designed \"Sparky\", a devil holding a trident (colloquially referred to as a pitchfork). Anthony is rumored to have based Sparky's facial features on that of his former boss, Walt Disney.\n\nParagraph 6: Having returned to the club where he started his career, Dyer faced competition for a starting place from HeiÃ°ar Helguson and Danny Webber. In 2003â04 he made 18 starting league appearances, scoring three goals. His strike rate improved the following season, with 9 goals from his 21 league starts. Despite being in good form, Dyer did not score in any of his six appearances following the arrival of new manager Aidy Boothroyd, and was released by Watford in May 2005. After spending a week on trial at Stoke City, he signed for the Championship club on a one-year deal. He joined  Millwall on a two-month loan on 4 November and made his debut a day later in a 3â1 defeat against Crewe Alexandra. He scored two goals against Sheffield United, which earned Millwall a 2â2 draw, and finished his loan spell with 10 appearances. After making 12 appearances for Stoke, he was released in January and subsequently signed for Sheffield United on a contract until the end of the 2005â06 season. He scored on his debut against Reading, giving his side the lead after nine minutes, but a Dave Kitson equaliser three minutes later saw the match end in a 1â1 draw. However, he was unable to score again in a further four appearances and joined Doncaster Rovers on 2 June 2006 on a free transfer. His Doncaster debut came in a 1â0 defeat to Carlisle United on the opening day of the 2006â07 season and scored with a low 20-yard shot during his second game against Crewe, which finished as a 3â1 victory. He joined Bradford City on a month's loan on 31 January 2007 and scored eight minutes into his debut against Nottingham Forest, with the match eventually finishing in a 2â2 draw. He finished his loan spell with five appearances for the club. After returning to Doncaster, he played in seven matches for the team, finishing the season with 17 appearances.\n\nParagraph 7:  Captain James CookâDusky Soundâ1772. \"For three or four days after we arrived in Pickersgill harbour, and as we were clearing the woods to set up our tents, &c. a four-footed animal was seen by three or four of our people; but as no two gave the same description of it, I cannot say of what kind it is. All, however, agreed, that it was about the size of a cat, with short legs, and of a mouse colour. One of the seamen, and he who had the best view of it, said it had a bushy tail, and was the most like a jackall of any animal he knew. The most probable conjecture is, that it is of a new species. Be this as it may, we are now certain that this country is not so destitute of quadrupeds as was once thought.\"Georg Forster, one of the biologists on board, doubted the observation of a quadruped in his report, A Voyage Round the World: \"We were surprised to see the young black dog in the boat with them, which ran away from us [...]. Though this animal had been in the woods during a fortnight, yet it was by no means famished, but on the contrary looked well fed [...] We may from hence conclude, that as there is abundance of food for carnivorous animals in New Zealand, they would probably be very numerous if they existed there at all, especially if they were endowed with any degree of sagacity, like the fox, or cat tribes. In that case they could not have escaped the notice of our numerous parties, nor of the natives, and the latter would certainly have preserved their furs, as a valuable article of dress in their moist and raw climate, for want of which they now wear the skins of dogs and of birds. The question, whether New Zealand contained any wild quadrupeds, had engaged our attention from our first arrival there. One of our people, strongly persuaded that so great a country could not fail of possessing new and unknown animals, had already twice reported that he had seen a brown animal, something less than a jackal or little fox, about the dawn of morning, sitting on a stump of a tree near our tents, and running off at his approach. But as this circumstance has never been confirmed by any subsequent testimony, nothing is more probable than that the want of day-light had deceived him, and that he had either observed one of the numerous wood-hens, which are brown, and creep through the bushes very frequently; or that one of our cats, on the watch for little birds, had been mistaken for a new quadruped.In 1864, Captain Frederick Hutton, speculated that the animal seen at Dusky Bay was probably a dog, \"as none on board had at that time seen a dog in New Zealand. The evidence of a kind of otter inhabiting the South Island rests upon some foot-prints seen by Dr. Haast\".\n\nParagraph 8: The most common storyline is that LÃ©onard comes up with the idea for an invention. He then proceeds to wake up his late-sleeping Disciple using various means which range from loudspeakers to explosives. After being blown to bits or suffering similar injuries, the Disciple gets himself together and grudgingly proceeds to help build and test LÃ©onard's latest idea. This invariably results in more damage to his body and soul, but failure to co-operate will result in him being on the receiving end of LÃ©onard's anvil or blunderbuss which the Master keeps conveniently tucked up in his beard. The story often ends with the Disciple covered in plaster and bandages and even having to go to hospital.\n\nParagraph 9: Johnson's breakthrough role came less than a month after she moved to Los Angeles, when she was selected to portray Kimberly Hart, the Pink Ranger, in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the first installment of the Power Rangers franchise. Despite the series being a huge success and having brought Johnson international recognition as an actress, the show brought her little financial security, as she and the others were paid only $600 a week for their work on the show, which included stunt work and public appearances; none of the cast received any royalty payments from re-runs of episodes they appeared in. During Johnson's time with the franchise, whose productions were non-union and not subject to safety codes standardized in union contracts, Johnson faced multiple instances of danger of physical harm; while filming Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, she was almost set on fire during a stunt and, during Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie, she was almost electrocuted. Johnson ultimately made the decision to leave the show in 1995, passing the role of the Pink Ranger to Australian actress Catherine Sutherland. In an appearance on I Love the '90s, Johnson jokingly stated that having been the Pink Power Ranger was something she would \"never live down.\" In later years, Johnson stated that becoming famous from the show was at times overwhelming and had given her nightmares, but that overall, she learned many things and is grateful to the show and her fans. In all, Johnson's character has appeared in 138 episodes in the franchise. She, alongside former co-star Jason David Frank, made a cameo appearance in the 2017 film Power Rangers, though not as Power Rangers themselves. In 2023, Johnson announced that she had declined to reprise the role of Kimberly Hart in the 30th anniversary Power Rangers special on Netflix but that she wished the special and her former co-stars well while also saying that she had other fun things in store for her fans that year.\n\nParagraph 10: The 2nd Marines were reactivated in February 1941 in San Diego, California.  This time the regiment was part of the newly formed 2nd Marine Division. The regiment, with the acting division commander and headquarters embarked in  and remaining elements embarked aboard  , ,  and , was placed on twenty-four hours alert for sailing effective 24 June with ultimate destination Guadalcanal. The ships sailed combat-loaded and ready for landing operations on arrival from San Diego on 1 July to the South Pacific in July 1942, to reinforce the 1st Marine Division during the Battle of Guadalcanal in 1942â43. On 7 August 1942 and in support of assaults onto Tulagi Island plus the islets of Gavutu and Tanambogo, the 1st Battalion, 2nd Marines landed in two locations onto Florida Island. Finding no Japanese troops, 1st Battalion, 2nd Marines shifted during day to support the 1st Marine Parachute Battalion on Gavutu and Tanambogo.  Gavutu and Tanambogo connected to each other via a causeway.  An attempted landing by Co. B, 2nd Marines onto the north coast of Tanambogo was unsuccessful.  On 8 August 1942, Third Battalion, 2nd Marines plus two tanks of Co. C, 2nd Marine Tank Battalion were landed onto southeast Tanambogo.  After hard fighting, Tanambogo secured by nightfall. Gavutu Island also secured on 8 August 1942.  Other elements of 2nd Marines secure islets of Makambo, Mbangai and Kokomtambu (all near Tulagi Island) over 7 and 8 August 1942.  On 9 August 1942, 2nd Marines headquarters plus attached companies of 2nd Amphibian Tractor Battalion, 2nd Service Battalion and portion of 3rd Battalion, 11th Marines (an artillery unit) taken by retiring naval forces to Espiritu Santo.  Via cargo ship USS Alhena, headquarters of 2nd Marines, including Col. J. M. Arthur, landed on Tulagi during 22 August 1942.  2nd Marines later moved to Guadalcanal with elements of 2nd Marines engaged in combat on Guadalcanal from 7 October 1942.\n\nParagraph 11: During the course of a game, players gain XP (experience) by completing actions such as constructing buildings, training units, killing enemies, and collecting treasures. Whenever a certain number of experience points are gained, the player can make use of a shipment from their respective Home City. Shipments slow down as the game goes on since more XP is required with every consecutive shipment. This XP is also added directly to the home city and is collected over multiple games, allowing it to level up over time. Players can gear their cards into three different combinations: \"Boom\" (economic combinations), \"Rush\" (military combinations), or \"Turtle\" (defensive combinations). The first few cards chosen are automatically added to the player's portfolio, where it can be copied onto a deck for use in a game. Later in the game, cards have to be manually chosen because of the limit of cards in one deck. Most cards are available to all civilizations, but some are unique to one. If the Home City being played has more than one deck, the player must select which to use when the first shipment is sent. During a game, players keep this initial deck; this feature encourages players to build decks that are customized for the map being played on, or that counter other civilizations. The decks support twenty cards. As the Home City improves by level, you may gain an extra card slot for the decks for every 10 levels.\n\nParagraph 12: In 1658, a French Capuchin monastery was founded by the site; in 1669 the monastery succeeded in purchasing the monument, which by the early 19th century was being used as the monastery library.

Lord Elgin negotiated unsuccessfully for the monument, by then an icon in the Greek Revival.\n\nParagraph 13: Throughout her career, Carey has been honoured several times for her musical and philanthropic work. In 1995, Carey was honoured as the Best-Selling World Recording Artist by the World Music Awards. In 1999, Carey was award a Congressional Award, for her work with The Fresh Air Fund and the New York City Administration for Children's Services. Towards the end of the '90s decade, Carey was named the Artist of the Decade by Billboard with Entertainment Tonight calling it one of her \"biggest milestones\". In August 2015, Carey was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2017, Carey was honoured at the VH1 Hip Hop Honors for her contributions to R&B and hip-hop genre. In 2019, Carey was honoured by Variety'''s Power of Women for her work with The Fresh Air Fund's Camp Mariah alongside Jennifer Aniston, Awkwafina, and numerous others. Dubbed the \"Queen of Christmas\" by the media, Carey and her popular song \"All I Want For Christmas Is You\" set four Guinness World Records in 2019. In 2021, Carey broke three more Guinness Word Records. One of these records was becoming the first artist in history to top the Billboard Hot 100 in four consecutive decades.\n\nParagraph 14: Rarely, pemoline is implicated in causing hepatotoxicity. Because of this, the FDA recommended that regular liver tests be performed in those treated with it. Since being introduced, it has been linked with at least 21 cases of liver failure, of which 13 resulted in liver replacement or death. Approximately 1â2% of patients taking the drug show elevated levels of liver transaminase enzymes, a marker for liver toxicity, though serious cases are rare. Over 200,000 children with ADHD were prescribed pemoline in the United States and Canada alone during the approximate 25 years that it was available, plus a smaller number of adults prescribed it for other indications (and not including prescriptions in the rest of the world). As such, the number of liver failure cases was statistically not that large. However the reactions proved idiosyncratic and unpredictable, with patients sometimes taking the drug with no issue for months or even years, before suddenly developing severe liver toxicity. There was no clear exposureâtoxicity relationship, and no characteristic liver pathology findings. Some patients showed as little as one week between first appearance of jaundice and complete liver failure, and some of the patients that developed liver failure had not showed elevated liver transaminase levels when tested previously. On the other hand, there are no cases of liver failure associated with pemoline in Japan, although it is used at lower doses and is only prescribed for the niche indication of narcolepsy in this country.\n\nParagraph 15: Throughout her career, Carey has been honoured several times for her musical and philanthropic work.

The championship match took place on April 25, but Jigsaw and Quackenbush were unable to defeat the reigning champions The Osirian Portal (Amasis and Ophidian). With Quackenbush out with a knee injury, he positioned Jigsaw as the mentor for the stable of younger wrestlers, called The Future Is Now, which consisted of Equinox, Helios and Lince Dorado. During the rest of the year, he also feuded with Gran Akuma, whom he would defeat in the main event on November 21. On October 23, 2010, Jigsaw represented Chikara in the torneo cibernetico match, where the company's originals faced Bruderschaft des Kreuzes (BDK). He was eliminated from the match by BDK's Tim Donst. After several attempts and failures at getting their third point, Jigsaw and Quackenbush finally earned their title match by winning a fourâway elimination match on November 22, during which they made all three eliminations. On December 12, 2010, at the season nine finale Reality is Relative Jigsaw and Quackenbush cashed in their points and defeated Ares and Castagnoli two falls to one to win the Campeonatos de Parejas for the first time. For the 2011 King of Trios, Jigsaw and Quackenbush formed a trio with Japanese joshi legend Manami Toyota and on April 15 defeated Amazing Red, Joel Maximo and Wil Maximo in their first round match. The following day, the trio was eliminated from the tournament in the quarterfinal stage by Team Michinoku Pro (Dick Togo, Great Sasuke and Jinsei Shinzaki). On September 18, Jigsaw and Quackenbush lost the Campeonatos de Parejas to F.I.S.T. (Chuck Taylor and Johnny Gargano) in their third defense. In November and December 2011, Jigsaw represented Chikara in Osaka Pro Wrestling, making his first tour of Japan in the process. The tour, which lasted from November 27 to December 18, saw Jigsaw take part in the annual Tenno-zan tournament, where he made it all the way to the semifinals, before losing to Kuuga. On May 20, 2012, during Chikara's tenth anniversary weekend, Jigsaw received his first shot at the Chikara Grand Championship, but was unable to dethrone Eddie Kingston. On September 14, Jigsaw and Mike Quackenbush reunited with Manami Toyota for the 2012 King of Trios, defeating combatAnt, deviAnt and Soldier Ant in their first round match. The following day, the team was eliminated from the tournament, after losing to Team Sendai Girls (Dash Chisako, Meiko Satomura and Sendai Sachiko).\n\nParagraph 17: In 1658, a French Capuchin monastery was founded by the site; in 1669 the monastery succeeded in purchasing the monument, which by the early 19th century was being used as the monastery library. The monument was popularly known as the \"Lantern of Demosthenes\" or \"Lantern of Diogenes\", although a reading of its inscription by Jacob Spon had established its original purpose.

Lord Elgin negotiated unsuccessfully for the monument, by then an icon in the Greek Revival.\n\nParagraph 18: The British built an airfield in CrÃ©cy to provide air support before the fall of France in 1940. During the Battle of France, the plan seems to have been to deploy RAF squadrons of Bristol Blenheim light bombers there, but it is not clear how intensively the airfield was used. In the confused days of mid-May 1940 one squadron that was ordered to deploy there did not due to the absence of any military protection. It is most notable for its occupation by the German Luftwaffe, with Gruppe ZerstÃ¶rergeschwader 26 of Messerschmitt Bf 110s stationed there from May 1940 until November 1940 when, after the end of the Battle of Britain, the Gruppe was withdrawn to Germany to rest and re-equip. Several other squadrons came and went, including some Messerschmitt Bf 109s. The entrance to the airfield is still visible on the left of the D12 road from CrÃ©cy to Ligescourt, midway between the two. Some fortified installations are also visible, hidden beneath trees on various sides of the airfield.\n\nParagraph 19: From 1886, Worthington began to acquire public houses, which provided a captive market for their product. In order to raise capital for this expansion, the firm became a public company in 1889, and Horace Brown was created joint managing director alongside William Posnette Manners (1846â1915). By this time the company had an annual output of around 200,000 barrels, and employed 470 people. By 1890, the company's bottling operations equalled those of Bass, Guinness, Allsopp and Whitbread. When William Henry Worthington (1826â1894) died he left no direct heirs and was the fourth and final generation of the family to manage Worthington & Co. Horace Brown left the company in 1894 following a dispute with co-manager William Manners. By 1900, 73 per cent of the company's equity was in the hands of William Posnette Manners, who had joined the company in 1862 as a junior clerk, and under his astute leadership Worthington acquired a reputation for the quality of its bottled pale ales. The company acquired the Burton Brewery Company in 1915. On Manners' death in 1915, control of the company passed to two of his sons, Arthur (1879â1968) and Ernest. Arthur was the architect of the merger with archrival Bass in 1927, and proved to be more than a match for John Gretton, 1st Baron Gretton, the chairman of the much larger Bass. Despite Bass's superior capitalization, the terms of the merger were such that Manners became chairman and joint managing director of Worthington, and deputy chairman and joint managing director of Bass. The amalgamation, described as 'the biggest non-merger in the history of the brewing industry', failed to realize its objectives. Apart from greater co-operation in bottled beer production and distribution, there were few economies and the two companies continued to operate as separate entities. Both boards were increasingly dominated by Manners and his family.\n\nParagraph 20: Brachyhyops is the oldest entelodont from North America and is recorded exclusively from late Eocene (late Duchesnean â early Chadronian) age deposits.  Their geographic range is restricted to western North America and spans from Saskatchewan, Canada to as far south as Big Bend, Texas, USA.  A total of nine localities have yielded Brachyhyops material.  The Cypress Hills Formation in Saskatchewan, Canada, suggests an early Chadronian age, approximately 37 Ma, and represents the type locality for Brachyhyops viensis as well as the northernmost area in which Brachyhyops specimens have been recorded.  Apparently an undocumented Brachyhyops specimen has been recorded from the late Eocene White River Formation of Montana, however, the exact museum location where this specimen is housed remains unknown.  Three localities in Wyoming yielded Brachyhyops material and these include a partial skull roof and maxilla from the lower White River Formation (late Eocene) of the Flagstaff Rim, Wyoming.  Based on size and tooth shape, these specimens have been assigned to B. viensis.  The next locality in Wyoming is the type locality for B. wyomingensis which was recorded from the Big Sand Draw Lentil of the White River Formation at Beaver Divide, and comprises a single skull without mandibles.  The third locality yielded cranial fragments that are assigned to B. viensis and were recorded from the lower strata of the White River Formation at Canyon Creek, approximately 50Â km east of Beaver Divide.  Additional Brachyhyops wyomingensis material was recorded from a single location in northeastern Utah, namely the Lapoint Member of the Duchesne River Formation, which has an age of approximately 39.74 Â± 0.07 Ma based on radioisotopic dates from nearby volcanic ashes.  Two localities within New Mexico yielded Brachyhyops material and include a single molar (m1) from the lower jaw that was assigned to B. viensis and recorded within the Duchesnean interval of the Galisteo Formation in north central New Mexico, and is of late Duchesnean (38 Ma) age.  An additional specimen was recorded from the upper Baca Formation at Mariano Mesa in west central New Mexico and is also situated within the Duchesnean.  This specimen comprises a single premolar and four molars (p3 â m4) from a single right lower jaw and are assigned to B. wyomingensis based on the shape and dimensions of the teeth.  The final locality within North America is located in Trans-Pecos, Texas, USA, and contains well documented records of Brachyhyops wyomingensis from the late Duchesnean Porvenir local fauna which is situated above a volcanic ash that is radioisotopically dated to 37.8 Â± 0.15 Ma.\n\nParagraph 21: The game started well for the Exiles as a long ball from Daniel Holdsworth which cut 3 men out allowed Joel Monaghan to break down the right side of the field, Holdsworth backed him up and passed inside to Steve Menzies. However Menzies was about to be tackled before Scott Dureau showed up to take the ball and perform a 360 degree swivel before offloading to Brett Hodgson who darted between 3 England players to score the first try of the game. Hodgson converted his own try to put the Exiles into an early 6-0 lead. England hit back in the 22nd minute, Scott Dureau put in a grubber kick which was fielded easily by Stefan Ratchford. Ratchford was tackled on his own 10m line, Warrington Wolves star Ryan Atkins then scooted from dummy half and evaded the markers to race 90m to score England's first try of the game. Danny Brough managed to kick the goal from a tight angle to level the scores at 6-6. However the Exiles soon regained the lead when stand off Daniel Holdsworth gave an inside ball to Steve Menzies which caught the England defence out. Menzies raced 30m before drawing the fullback in and passing to the supporting Lincoln Withers who had to pass to Scott Dureau to avoid the cover defence. Dureau crossed under the sticks and captain Brett Hodgson converted to give the Exiles a 12-6 lead. England once again hit back with a move which went to the left of the field and back to the right again. Rob Burrow ran across the face of the defence and found Ratchford, he then gave an inside ball to Jon Wilkin, as Wilkin was about to be tackled he quickly offloaded to Danny Brough, Brough ran to the right, isolated the Exiles winger and found Leroy Cudjoe with a cutout pass, he drew the winger in and passed outside to Josh Charnley who raced 25m and stepped inside Brett Hodgson to score a try. This time Danny Brough could not convert the try and the Exiles held onto a 2-point lead. The Exiles extended their lead even further just before the half time hooter. A scrum gave the Exiles vital field position which allowed them to execute a sweeping move to the left of the field with Brett Hodgson delivering the final cut out ball for Joel Monaghan to score in the corner. Hodgson could not convert the difficult kick but the Exiles went into halftime 16-10 up.\n\nParagraph 22: Throughout her career, Carey has been honoured several times for her musical and philanthropic work. In 1995, Carey was honoured as the Best-Selling World Recording Artist by the World Music Awards. In 1999, Carey was award a Congressional Award, for her work with The Fresh Air Fund and the New York City Administration for Children's Services. Towards the end of the '90s decade, Carey was named the Artist of the Decade by Billboard with Entertainment Tonight calling it one of her \"biggest milestones\". In August 2015, Carey was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2017, Carey was honoured at the VH1 Hip Hop Honors for her contributions to R&B and hip-hop genre. In 2019, Carey was honoured by Variety'''s Power of Women for her work with The Fresh Air Fund's Camp Mariah alongside Jennifer Aniston, Awkwafina, and numerous others. Dubbed the \"Queen of Christmas\" by the media, Carey and her popular song \"All I Want For Christmas Is You\" set four Guinness World Records in 2019. In 2021, Carey broke three more Guinness Word Records. One of these records was becoming the first artist in history to top the Billboard Hot 100 in four consecutive decades.\n\nParagraph 23: In May 2008, Newport Television agreed to sell WOAI-TV and five other stations to High Plains Broadcasting because of ownership conflicts. Providence Equity Partners also holds a 19% ownership stake in Univision Communications, the owner of Univision owned-and-operated station KWEX-TV (channel 41) and Telefutura station KNIC-TV (channel 17). In the case of San Antonio, it would have given Providence Equity control of three stations in the market. Even without KNIC in the picture, both WOAI and KWEX were among the four highest-rated stations in the San Antonio market at the time of the Clear Channel sale (and remain so today). The FCC normally does not allow two of the four highest-rated stations to be owned by a single entity. The sale was finalized on September 15, 2008. However, the sale to High Plains Broadcasting was in name only. Newport continued to operate the station under a shared services agreement, with High Plains only holding the FCC assets of the station (including the license). This effectively made High Plains Broadcasting a front company for Newport Television in a relationship similar to that between Mission Broadcasting and Nexstar Broadcasting Group as well as between Cunningham Broadcasting (and later Deerfield Media) and the Sinclair Broadcast Group. On December 17, 2007, WOAI debuted a slightly altered logo.\n\nParagraph 24: The most common storyline is that LÃ©onard comes up with the idea for an invention. He then proceeds to wake up his late-sleeping Disciple using various means which range from loudspeakers to explosives. After being blown to bits or suffering similar injuries, the Disciple gets himself together and grudgingly proceeds to help build and test LÃ©onard's latest idea. This invariably results in more damage to his body and soul, but failure to co-operate will result in him being on the receiving end of LÃ©onard's anvil or blunderbuss which the Master keeps conveniently tucked up in his beard. The story often ends with the Disciple covered in plaster and bandages and even having to go to hospital.\n\nParagraph 25: JTF 1â501 deployed to Operation Enduring Freedom â Afghanistan from October 2003 until August 2004 under the direct command of CJTF-180 and 1st Brigade, 10th Mountain Division. Its first mission was to open the 'Khowst-Gardez Pass', also known as 'Ambush Alley' during the Russian/Soviet occupation. After a successful and (almost) uncontested Ground Assault Convoy (GAC) through Ambush Alley, the 501st based itself just outside the city of Khowst, helping to build what became known as FOB Salerno (Forward Operating Base Salerno), near the eastern border with Pakistan. The 501st played a significant role in disrupting enemy communications and infiltrations across the border in their Area of Operation. Commanded by LTC Harry C. Glenn, the 501st conducted coordinated searches and patrolled the mountains during Operations Avalanche, Blizzard, and Storm, in which its mission was to root out Taliban and Al Qaeda loyalists in the Khowst Province and Paktia Province. The natives of the region, mainly the Pashtun, wereâmore often than notâboth enemies and allies to the 501st, making the mission that much more difficult. However, in comparison to the prior Soviet occupation, within just a few visits and 'elder tea meetings', the 501st quickly earned the trust of the local people and militia/warlords. As a result of the unit's time in-country, few enemies were killed, yet many were detained and captured when necessary (using an incredibly strict system that often resulted in capturing and re-capturing individuals, until it was proved that they were definitely 'enemy combatants'). Local Pashtun shepherds would even inform the 501st when non-local 'Arabs' planted IEDs (improvised explosive devices)/bombs on roads and trade routes, such that the 501st could help protect the local people. In addition, the 501st collected/confiscated tons upon tons of ammunition and weapons, which were destroyed, in the attempt to make the region safer for everyone (as referenced by direct US military reports in WikiLeaks). During the occupation, the 501st conducted countless cordon and searches while confronting enemy combatants in direct battles. Furthermore, the 501st secured the Afghani border, organized the first known meeting between Afghani/Pakistani Officials since the Durand Line was established, created inter and intrastate commerce, advised on (and helped build) civil-security, conducted 'tail-gate' medicine to help with local health and prosperity issues, and even provided security for male and female children schools (often the target of radical Islam terrorist operations), with the overall intent to secure the entire region for local Democratic elections and allow for mutual peace and mutual prosperity of the Afghani/Pakistani region. The 1â501 was supported by an Air Force Special Operations Team (TACP), commanded by Captain A. Rodell Severson.  http://www.airforcetimes.com/legacy/new/0-AIRPAPER-2817838.php. The TACP went on all missions, providing Battlespace Control for the Geronimos and were an integral part of the Joint Task Force.\n\nParagraph 26: According to the narrative found in the Vana Parva (Ch.122-5) of the Mahabharata, Chyavana was so absorbed in practising austerities on the side of a lake that termites built up their mound all over his body and only his eyes were left. Once, Sharyati, along with his army and household, came to visit the place. Sukanya, daughter of king Sharyati, seeing only two bright eyes in what seemed to be an anthill, poked them with a stick. Chyavana felt excessive pain and became furious. He obstructed the calls of nature of Sharyati's army. He was pleased only after the king gave him his daughter in marriage. Subsequently, the Ashvins came to the hermitage of Chyavana. They saw Sukanya while she was bathing, and tried to convince Sukanya to reject old and ugly Chyavana and accept one of them as her husband. They also promised to restore the youth of Chyavana first so that she could make an unbiased choice amongst Chyavana and one of them. Sukanya rejected their proposal and informed Chyavana. Later, at the behest of Chyavana, Sukanya requested the Ashvins to do so. All three took bath in the lake and came out with the same youthful divine look. Each of them requested Sukanya to be his bride, but she identified Chyavana and selected him. In gratitude, Chyavana assured the Ashvins that he would ensure that the Ashvins get their share of the sacrificial offerings. Accordingly, Chyavana, while officiating as a priest of Sharyati in a soma sacrifice, offered the share of the sacrifice to the Ashvins. Indra objected to this, stating that as mere servants of the devas, so they have no right to receive offering of Soma juice. When the sage ignored his opinion, he tried to hurl his vajra (thunderbolt) towards Chyavana, but his arms were paralysed by Chyavana before he could do so. Chyavana, by virtue of his ascetic energy, created a huge asura, Mada, with four fangs. Mada was on the point of devouring Indra, when he became afraid, and finally accepted the right of the Ashvins to have a share of the offerings.\n\nParagraph 27: According to the narrative found in the Vana Parva (Ch.122-5) of the Mahabharata, Chyavana was so absorbed in practising austerities on the side of a lake that termites built up their mound all over his body and only his eyes were left.

It was hypothesized that Orthosuchus lived mainly on terrestrial land, but some key factors contribute to the fact that it spent time mostly in water. The first notable evidence is on the palate, which was covered by soft tissue, not bone. The choanae are on the back of the palate and a valve was used to help close the glottis. These features help Orthosuchus keep breathing when submerging in the aquatic system. The ears are protected by earflaps, which prevent water inflow to the otic recess when this animal is in water. Modern crocodiles also have earflaps to decrease water entry. The shape of the skull, especially the snout, is similar to an Indian gharial, Gavialis gangeticus, who prey on small fish. It is possible that Orthosuchus has the same predation, by slowly moving toward schools of small fish and swallow from the side. The aquatic environment provides plenty of food for the animal, besides small fish, the animal could also feed on lake invertebrates. Orthosuchus has a small salt-secreting gland, which indicates that it is not a marine animal. And because the pubis articulates with the front region of the ischium, it is believed to be a basal animal that lived in swamps and lakes. The animal is probably quadrupedal because the fore limbs are approximately 91% the length of the hind limb, which also makes the walking on land easier. Unlike modern crocodiles, Orthosuchus does not creep on its belly; it probably walks at a high position with its femur vertical to the ground. According to Parrish, primitive crocodylomorphs did not have a crawling stance because it was more used to the terrestrial environment. However, Orthosuchus may not be a good swimmer, since it has amphicoelous vertebrae, whereas modern crocodiles have procoelous vertebrae, which increase the mobility of the tail.\n\nParagraph 29: During the course of a game, players gain XP (experience) by completing actions such as constructing buildings, training units, killing enemies, and collecting treasures. Whenever a certain number of experience points are gained, the player can make use of a shipment from their respective Home City. Shipments slow down as the game goes on since more XP is required with every consecutive shipment. This XP is also added directly to the home city and is collected over multiple games, allowing it to level up over time. Players can gear their cards into three different combinations: \"Boom\" (economic combinations), \"Rush\" (military combinations), or \"Turtle\" (defensive combinations). The first few cards chosen are automatically added to the player's portfolio, where it can be copied onto a deck for use in a game. Later in the game, cards have to be manually chosen because of the limit of cards in one deck. Most cards are available to all civilizations, but some are unique to one. If the Home City being played has more than one deck, the player must select which to use when the first shipment is sent. During a game, players keep this initial deck; this feature encourages players to build decks that are customized for the map being played on, or that counter other civilizations. The decks support twenty cards. As the Home City improves by level, you may gain an extra card slot for the decks for every 10 levels.\n\nParagraph 30:  Captain James CookâDusky Soundâ1772. \"For three or four days after we arrived in Pickersgill harbour, and as we were clearing the woods to set up our tents, &c. a four-footed animal was seen by three or four of our people; but as no two gave the same description of it, I cannot say of what kind it is. All, however, agreed, that it was about the size of a cat, with short legs, and of a mouse colour. One of the seamen, and he who had the best view of it, said it had a bushy tail, and was the most like a jackall of any animal he knew. The most probable conjecture is, that it is of a new species. Be this as it may, we are now certain that this country is not so destitute of quadrupeds as was once thought.\"Georg Forster, one of the biologists on board, doubted the observation of a quadruped in his report, A Voyage Round the World: \"We were surprised to see the young black dog in the boat with them, which ran away from us [...]. Though this animal had been in the woods during a fortnight, yet it was by no means famished, but on the contrary looked well fed [...] We may from hence conclude, that as there is abundance of food for carnivorous animals in New Zealand, they would probably be very numerous if they existed there at all, especially if they were endowed with any degree of sagacity, like the fox, or cat tribes. In that case they could not have escaped the notice of our numerous parties, nor of the natives, and the latter would certainly have preserved their furs, as a valuable article of dress in their moist and raw climate, for want of which they now wear the skins of dogs and of birds. The question, whether New Zealand contained any wild quadrupeds, had engaged our attention from our first arrival there. One of our people, strongly persuaded that so great a country could not fail of possessing new and unknown animals, had already twice reported that he had seen a brown animal, something less than a jackal or little fox, about the dawn of morning, sitting on a stump of a tree near our tents, and running off at his approach. But as this circumstance has never been confirmed by any subsequent testimony, nothing is more probable than that the want of day-light had deceived him, and that he had either observed one of the numerous wood-hens, which are brown, and creep through the bushes very frequently; or that one of our cats, on the watch for little birds, had been mistaken for a new quadruped.In 1864, Captain Frederick Hutton, speculated that the animal seen at Dusky Bay was probably a dog, \"as none on board had at that time seen a dog in New Zealand. The evidence of a kind of otter inhabiting the South Island rests upon some foot-prints seen by Dr. Haast\".\n\nParagraph 31: The Ipstones family were prominent in the affairs of Staffordshire, and had held Blymhill in Cuttlestone Hundred for some time. However, they had a long history of feuding with their neighbours. John de Ipstones, the MP's grandfather, had a particularly violent reputation and had initiated many of the quarrels which still raged in the last decades of the 14th century. In 1316 he and the abbot of Lilleshall Abbey were in trouble for mobilising a large armed force to prevent the arrest of Vivian de Staundon, known to have stolen a large sum of money belonging to the king, Edward II. In 1324 he was involved in a furious dispute with the Brumpton or Brompton family. This initially centred on the church of StÂ Editha at Church Eaton, where John Ipstones, together with a group of his friends and relatives, expelled the incumbent, Thomas de Brumpton, by force and installed his own brother, William, garrisoning the church itself and attacking the manor house, which was the home of Mary de Brumpton. In 1325 the Ipstones family mounted an armed demonstration at Stafford during a county muster, with the result that a pitched battle between the Ipstones and Brumpton forces took place in the town, \"to the great terror of the King's subjects, and against the King's peace.\" Mass arrests followed and in the ensuing trials most of the accused admitted arming in support of their family cause, although the Brumpton side generally denied terrorising the innocent, implying their actions had been in self-defence. In 1327 the cycle of feuding began again with a robbery committed by John, William and Philip Ipstones against Thomas de Brumpton. In the same court session Isabel of Pitchford accused them and their group of murdering her husband, Richard. The Sheriff of Staffordshire, Sir John de Hynkele, claimed that four of the group were too ill for him to produce them in court but he was fined 13s. 4d. for his \"frivolous and insufficient\" excuse. Although later apprehended and confined to the Marshalsea, all but one were released because Isabel did not appear in court against them and the county coroners later claimed they could not find the indictments. However, in 1329 a fracas on the way home led to the deaths of Philip Prior, the remaining accused, and William de Ipstones, and a near-fatal injury to John. At this point the robbery charge too was abandoned because the indictments could not be found. Early in 1330 John de Ipstones pleaded benefit of clergy when accused of murdering Thomas de Stafford. At a court appearance later in the year, when he was found not guilty, it transpired the case had been delayed because John had, in the interim, assaulted an Oxford University student. This pattern of mayhem, intimidation and virtual impunity seems to have been repeated across the generations.\n\nParagraph 32: From 1886, Worthington began to acquire public houses, which provided a captive market for their product. In order to raise capital for this expansion, the firm became a public company in 1889, and Horace Brown was created joint managing director alongside William Posnette Manners (1846â1915). By this time the company had an annual output of around 200,000 barrels, and employed 470 people. By 1890, the company's bottling operations equalled those of Bass, Guinness, Allsopp and Whitbread. When William Henry Worthington (1826â1894) died he left no direct heirs and was the fourth and final generation of the family to manage Worthington & Co. Horace Brown left the company in 1894 following a dispute with co-manager William Manners. By 1900, 73 per cent of the company's equity was in the hands of William Posnette Manners, who had joined the company in 1862 as a junior clerk, and under his astute leadership Worthington acquired a reputation for the quality of its bottled pale ales. The company acquired the Burton Brewery Company in 1915. On Manners' death in 1915, control of the company passed to two of his sons, Arthur (1879â1968) and Ernest. Arthur was the architect of the merger with archrival Bass in 1927, and proved to be more than a match for John Gretton, 1st Baron Gretton, the chairman of the much larger Bass. Despite Bass's superior capitalization, the terms of the merger were such that Manners became chairman and joint managing director of Worthington, and deputy chairman and joint managing director of Bass. The amalgamation, described as 'the biggest non-merger in the history of the brewing industry', failed to realize its objectives. Apart from greater co-operation in bottled beer production and distribution, there were few economies and the two companies continued to operate as separate entities. Both boards were increasingly dominated by Manners and his family.\n\nParagraph 33: Having returned to the club where he started his career, Dyer faced competition for a starting place from HeiÃ°ar Helguson and Danny Webber. In 2003â04 he made 18 starting league appearances, scoring three goals. His strike rate improved the following season, with 9 goals from his 21 league starts. Despite being in good form, Dyer did not score in any of his six appearances following the arrival of new manager Aidy Boothroyd, and was released by Watford in May 2005. After spending a week on trial at Stoke City, he signed for the Championship club on a one-year deal. He joined  Millwall on a two-month loan on 4 November and made his debut a day later in a 3â1 defeat against Crewe Alexandra. He scored two goals against Sheffield United, which earned Millwall a 2â2 draw, and finished his loan spell with 10 appearances. After making 12 appearances for Stoke, he was released in January and subsequently signed for Sheffield United on a contract until the end of the 2005â06 season. He scored on his debut against Reading, giving his side the lead after nine minutes, but a Dave Kitson equaliser three minutes later saw the match end in a 1â1 draw. However, he was unable to score again in a further four appearances and joined Doncaster Rovers on 2 June 2006 on a free transfer. His Doncaster debut came in a 1â0 defeat to Carlisle United on the opening day of the 2006â07 season and scored with a low 20-yard shot during his second game against Crewe, which finished as a 3â1 victory. He joined Bradford City on a month's loan on 31 January 2007 and scored eight minutes into his debut against Nottingham Forest, with the match eventually finishing in a 2â2 draw. He finished his loan spell with five appearances for the club. After returning to Doncaster, he played in seven matches for the team, finishing the season with 17 appearances.\n\nParagraph 34: You have asked also, dearest son, what I thought of those who obtain God's grace in sickness and weakness, whether they are to be accounted legitimate Christians, for that they are not to be washed, but sprinkled, with the saving water. In this point, my diffidence and modesty prejudges none, so as to prevent any from feeling what he thinks right, and from doing what he feels to be right. As far as my poor understanding conceives it, I think that the divine benefits can in no respect be mutilated and weakened; nor can anything less occur in that case, where, with full and entire faith both of the giver and receiver, is accepted what is drawn from the divine gifts...nor ought it to trouble any one that sick people seem to be sprinkled or affused, when they obtain the Lord's grace, when Holy Scripture speaks by the mouth of the prophet Ezekiel, and says, \"Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you. And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit will I put within you.\" (Ez 36,25) Also in Numbers: \"And the man that shall be unclean until the evening shall be purified on the third day, and on the seventh day shall be clean: but if he shall not be purified on the third day, on the seventh day he shall not be clean. And that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of sprinkling hath not been sprinkled upon him.\" (Nm 19,12-13) And again: \"And the Lord spake unto Moses saying, Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them. And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: thou shall sprinkle them with the water of purification.\" (Nm 8,6-7) And again: \"The water of sprinkling is a purification.\" Whence it appears that the sprinkling also of water prevails equally with the washing of salvation; and that when this is done in the Church, where the faith both of receiver and giver is sound, all things hold and may be consummated and perfected by the majesty of the Lord and by the truth of faith.\n\nParagraph 35: Waiyaki Wa Hinga, was the son of Kumale ole Lemotaka, a Maasai whose family had sought refuge in Muranga, most probably during the Lloikop wars. Due to his Maasai background, Kumale ole Lemotaka was given the name Hinga by the Kikuyu. This name, meaning dissembler, was given to those who lived amongst Kikuyus but spoke the Maa language, or those who had lived among Maasais before. Waiyaki Wa Hinga was the owner of a large Agikuyu fort at the frontier of Kikuyu country. Upon encountering the Imperial British East Africa Company, he was genuinely interested in establishing and cementing ties with them. We see this when Waiyaki welcomes Frederick Lugard, and gives him land so hat he can set-up a fort. However, there was a mis-understanding right from the very beginning on which position Waiyaki held in Kikuyu society. British officials understood him to be the \"Paramount Chiefs of the Agikuyu\". However, Kikuyus did not have paramount chiefs in their political system; Waiyaki was a Kikuyu Muthamaki (singular) out of the many influential athamakis (plural). In Kikuyu society, a muthamaki was a spokesman, the chairman of a territorial unit and leader of his age-set. Athamakis were the first or leading personalities among peers; their role was highly controlled by their fellow peers. Given this, Waiyaki Wa Hinga did not hold the most superior position amongst Kabete Kikuyus. He had no powers to make a treaty that affected the welfare of the community, nor even control the warriors, which Waiyaki tried to do a number of times when he soldiers wanted to attack the company. So when there were constant mis-understandings between the Company and the Kikuyu community at Lugardâs Fort, any retaliation by the Kikuyu community to the Company was not done so at Waiyakiâs command. In 1892, a quarrel between him and Purkiss leads to his death. This is after an expedition to punish Kikuyus of Githinguri for killing Maktubu, a worker of the Imperial British East Africa Company, fails. Purkiss is angry with Waiyaki as it was him who warned the community. Waiyaki feared his cattle would be impounded together with those of the culprits who had murdered Maktubu. A row flared between him and Purkiss. Waiyaki was then wounded in the head with his own sword, which he had drawn to attack Purkiss with. Due to this, Waiyaki is taken to Mombasa to be tried under IBEACo. Unfortunately, he never reached Mombasa: he died and was buried at Kibwezi en route to the kenyan coast. Waiyaki Way in central Nairobi is reportedly named after him.\n\nParagraph 36: Brachyhyops is the oldest entelodont from North America and is recorded exclusively from late Eocene (late Duchesnean â early Chadronian) age deposits.  Their geographic range is restricted to western North America and spans from Saskatchewan, Canada to as far south as Big Bend, Texas, USA.  A total of nine localities have yielded Brachyhyops material.  The Cypress Hills Formation in Saskatchewan, Canada, suggests an early Chadronian age, approximately 37 Ma, and represents the type locality for Brachyhyops viensis as well as the northernmost area in which Brachyhyops specimens have been recorded.  Apparently an undocumented Brachyhyops specimen has been recorded from the late Eocene White River Formation of Montana, however, the exact museum location where this specimen is housed remains unknown.  Three localities in Wyoming yielded Brachyhyops material and these include a partial skull roof and maxilla from the lower White River Formation (late Eocene) of the Flagstaff Rim, Wyoming.  Based on size and tooth shape, these specimens have been assigned to B. viensis.  The next locality in Wyoming is the type locality for B. wyomingensis which was recorded from the Big Sand Draw Lentil of the White River Formation at Beaver Divide, and comprises a single skull without mandibles.  The third locality yielded cranial fragments that are assigned to B. viensis and were recorded from the lower strata of the White River Formation at Canyon Creek, approximately 50Â km east of Beaver Divide.  Additional Brachyhyops wyomingensis material was recorded from a single location in northeastern Utah, namely the Lapoint Member of the Duchesne River Formation, which has an age of approximately 39.74 Â± 0.07 Ma based on radioisotopic dates from nearby volcanic ashes.  Two localities within New Mexico yielded Brachyhyops material and include a single molar (m1) from the lower jaw that was assigned to B. viensis and recorded within the Duchesnean interval of the Galisteo Formation in north central New Mexico, and is of late Duchesnean (38 Ma) age.  An additional specimen was recorded from the upper Baca Formation at Mariano Mesa in west central New Mexico and is also situated within the Duchesnean.  This specimen comprises a single premolar and four molars (p3 â m4) from a single right lower jaw and are assigned to B. wyomingensis based on the shape and dimensions of the teeth.  The final locality within North America is located in Trans-Pecos, Texas, USA, and contains well documented records of Brachyhyops wyomingensis from the late Duchesnean Porvenir local fauna which is situated above a volcanic ash that is radioisotopically dated to 37.8 Â± 0.15 Ma.\n\nParagraph 37: From 1886, Worthington began to acquire public houses, which provided a captive market for their product. In order to raise capital for this expansion, the firm became a public company in 1889, and Horace Brown was created joint managing director alongside William Posnette Manners (1846â1915). By this time the company had an annual output of around 200,000 barrels, and employed 470 people. By 1890, the company's bottling operations equalled those of Bass, Guinness, Allsopp and Whitbread. When William Henry Worthington (1826â1894) died he left no direct heirs and was the fourth and final generation of the family to manage Worthington & Co. Horace Brown left the company in 1894 following a dispute with co-manager William Manners. By 1900, 73 per cent of the company's equity was in the hands of William Posnette Manners, who had joined the company in 1862 as a junior clerk, and under his astute leadership Worthington acquired a reputation for the quality of its bottled pale ales. The company acquired the Burton Brewery Company in 1915. On Manners' death in 1915, control of the company passed to two of his sons, Arthur (1879â1968) and Ernest. Arthur was the architect of the merger with archrival Bass in 1927, and proved to be more than a match for John Gretton, 1st Baron Gretton, the chairman of the much larger Bass. Despite Bass's superior capitalization, the terms of the merger were such that Manners became chairman and joint managing director of Worthington, and deputy chairman and joint managing director of Bass. The amalgamation, described as 'the biggest non-merger in the history of the brewing industry', failed to realize its objectives. Apart from greater co-operation in bottled beer production and distribution, there were few economies and the two companies continued to operate as separate entities. Both boards were increasingly dominated by Manners and his family.\n\nParagraph 38: The game started well for the Exiles as a long ball from Daniel Holdsworth which cut 3 men out allowed Joel Monaghan to break down the right side of the field, Holdsworth backed him up and passed inside to Steve Menzies. However Menzies was about to be tackled before Scott Dureau showed up to take the ball and perform a 360 degree swivel before offloading to Brett Hodgson who darted between 3 England players to score the first try of the game. Hodgson converted his own try to put the Exiles into an early 6-0 lead. England hit back in the 22nd minute, Scott Dureau put in a grubber kick which was fielded easily by Stefan Ratchford. Ratchford was tackled on his own 10m line, Warrington Wolves star Ryan Atkins then scooted from dummy half and evaded the markers to race 90m to score England's first try of the game. Danny Brough managed to kick the goal from a tight angle to level the scores at 6-6. However the Exiles soon regained the lead when stand off Daniel Holdsworth gave an inside ball to Steve Menzies which caught the England defence out. Menzies raced 30m before drawing the fullback in and passing to the supporting Lincoln Withers who had to pass to Scott Dureau to avoid the cover defence. Dureau crossed under the sticks and captain Brett Hodgson converted to give the Exiles a 12-6 lead. England once again hit back with a move which went to the left of the field and back to the right again. Rob Burrow ran across the face of the defence and found Ratchford, he then gave an inside ball to Jon Wilkin, as Wilkin was about to be tackled he quickly offloaded to Danny Brough, Brough ran to the right, isolated the Exiles winger and found Leroy Cudjoe with a cutout pass, he drew the winger in and passed outside to Josh Charnley who raced 25m and stepped inside Brett Hodgson to score a try. This time Danny Brough could not convert the try and the Exiles held onto a 2-point lead. The Exiles extended their lead even further just before the half time hooter. A scrum gave the Exiles vital field position which allowed them to execute a sweeping move to the left of the field with Brett Hodgson delivering the final cut out ball for Joel Monaghan to score in the corner. Hodgson could not convert the difficult kick but the Exiles went into halftime 16-10 up.\n\nParagraph 39: You have asked also, dearest son, what I thought of those who obtain God's grace in sickness and weakness, whether they are to be accounted legitimate Christians, for that they are not to be washed, but sprinkled, with the saving water. In this point, my diffidence and modesty prejudges none, so as to prevent any from feeling what he thinks right, and from doing what he feels to be right. As far as my poor understanding conceives it, I think that the divine benefits can in no respect be mutilated and weakened; nor can anything less occur in that case, where, with full and entire faith both of the giver and receiver, is accepted what is drawn from the divine gifts...nor ought it to trouble any one that sick people seem to be sprinkled or affused, when they obtain the Lord's grace, when Holy Scripture speaks by the mouth of the prophet Ezekiel, and says, \"Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you. And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit will I put within you.\" (Ez 36,25) Also in Numbers: \"And the man that shall be unclean until the evening shall be purified on the third day, and on the seventh day shall be clean: but if he shall not be purified on the third day, on the seventh day he shall not be clean. And that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of sprinkling hath not been sprinkled upon him.\" (Nm 19,12-13) And again: \"And the Lord spake unto Moses saying, Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them. And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: thou shall sprinkle them with the water of purification.\" (Nm 8,6-7) And again: \"The water of sprinkling is a purification.\" Whence it appears that the sprinkling also of water prevails equally with the washing of salvation; and that when this is done in the Church, where the faith both of receiver and giver is sound, all things hold and may be consummated and perfected by the majesty of the Lord and by the truth of faith.\n\nParagraph 40: The 2nd Marines were reactivated in February 1941 in San Diego, California.  This time the regiment was part of the newly formed 2nd Marine Division. The regiment, with the acting division commander and headquarters embarked in  and remaining elements embarked aboard  , ,  and , was placed on twenty-four hours alert for sailing effective 24 June with ultimate destination Guadalcanal. The ships sailed combat-loaded and ready for landing operations on arrival from San Diego on 1 July to the South Pacific in July 1942, to reinforce the 1st Marine Division during the Battle of Guadalcanal in 1942â43. On 7 August 1942 and in support of assaults onto Tulagi Island plus the islets of Gavutu and Tanambogo, the 1st Battalion, 2nd Marines landed in two locations onto Florida Island. Finding no Japanese troops, 1st Battalion, 2nd Marines shifted during day to support the 1st Marine Parachute Battalion on Gavutu and Tanambogo.  Gavutu and Tanambogo connected to each other via a causeway.  An attempted landing by Co. B, 2nd Marines onto the north coast of Tanambogo was unsuccessful.  On 8 August 1942, Third Battalion, 2nd Marines plus two tanks of Co. C, 2nd Marine Tank Battalion were landed onto southeast Tanambogo.  After hard fighting, Tanambogo secured by nightfall. Gavutu Island also secured on 8 August 1942.  Other elements of 2nd Marines secure islets of Makambo, Mbangai and Kokomtambu (all near Tulagi Island) over 7 and 8 August 1942.  On 9 August 1942, 2nd Marines headquarters plus attached companies of 2nd Amphibian Tractor Battalion, 2nd Service Battalion and portion of 3rd Battalion, 11th Marines (an artillery unit) taken by retiring naval forces to Espiritu Santo.  Via cargo ship USS Alhena, headquarters of 2nd Marines, including Col. J. M. Arthur, landed on Tulagi during 22 August 1942.  2nd Marines later moved to Guadalcanal with elements of 2nd Marines engaged in combat on Guadalcanal from 7 October 1942.\n\nPlease enter the final count of unique paragraphs after removing duplicates.

They are hunted for their meat, for their fat, for young individuals, throughout all the summer, all the autumn and part of the winter, by whites with a gun, by negros with nets. The species must continue to decline, and in a short time. In abandoning populated areas to retreat to those that are yet to be so, and into the interior of the island, fugitive negros do not spare them when they can get them .... I ought to put in here what little I know about rougettes. One never sees them flying by day. They live communally in the large hollows of rotten trees, in numbers sometimes exceeding four hundred. They only leave in the evening as darkness falls and return before dawn. One is assured, and it is taken in this island for granted, that, however many individuals make up one of these associations, there is but a single male. I have not been able to verify this fact. I should only say that these sedentary animals become fat; that at the beginning of the colony, numerous poorly off and unfastidious people, taught no doubt by the Malacasses, provided themselves plentifully with this fat for preparing their food. I have seen the time when a bat-tree (it is thus that one used to call the retreats of our rougettes) was a real find. It used to be easy, as far as one can judge, to prevent these animals leaving, than to take them out alive one by one, or to suffocate them with smoke, and in one way or another discover the number of males or females of which the association was composed; I do not know any more about this species.\n\nParagraph 2: On June 7, he, BxB Hulk and PAC captured the Triangle Gate titles from CIMA, Gamma & KAGETORA, and they held them for three months before dropping them to Masaaki Mochizuki, Don Fujii & Akebono. On July 11, 2010, Yoshino defeated YAMATO to win the Open the Dream Gate Championship for the first time. On August 14, 2010, Yoshino defeated Tigers Mask to win the Open the Brave Gate Championship for the fifth time, but immediately afterwards vacated the title, due to also holding the Open the Dream Gate Championship. On August 24, 2010, Yoshino and Naruki Doi won their third Summer Adventure Tag League by defeating Genki Horiguchi and Ryo Saito in the finals. On October 13, 2010, Doi, bitter about Yoshino winning the Open the Dream Gate Championship, turned on him and BxB Hulk and joined the former Deep Drunkers and Takuya Sugawara to form a new heel stable. On December 26, 2010, at Final Gate 2010 Yoshino successfully defended the Open the Dream Gate Championship against Doi. On January 30, 2011, Yoshino and PAC defeated Chuck Taylor and Johnny Gargano to become Dragon Gate USA's first ever Open the United Gate Champions. On April 14, 2011, Yoshino lost the Open the Dream Gate Championship to Masaaki Mochizuki. At the same event, World-1 failed to win the Open the Triangle Gate Championship from Blood Warriors and was as a result forced to disband. On April 24 former World-1 members Yoshino, BxB Hulk, PAC and Susumu Yokosuka agreed to form a new alliance with Masaaki Mochizuki to battle Blood Warriors. On June 8, the new group was named Junction Three in reference to it being a union between the former members of World-1, KAMIKAZE and the Veteran-gun. On June 18, Yoshino, Gamma and YAMATO defeated the Blood Warriors team of CIMA, Naruki Doi and BxB Hulk to win the vacant Open the Triangle Gate Championship. They would go on to lose the title to the Blood Warriors team of Kzy, Naoki Tanisaki and Naruki Doi on September 2. On September 11, Yoshino and PAC lost the Open the United Gate Championship to Open the Twin Gate Champions, CIMA and Ricochet, in a title vs. title match. On February 9, 2012, Junction Three was forced to disband, after losing a fourteen-man elimination tag team match to Blood Warriors. Yoshino then reunited with Naruki Doi to form World-1 International.  On March 30, 2012, he and Ricochet defeated Ronin's Chuck Taylor and Johnny Gargano at a Dragon Gate USA event in Miami, Florida, to win the vacant Open the United Gate Championship. On May 6, Yoshino, Doi and Pac won the Open the Triangle Gate Championship.  On June 21, 2012, Yoshino and Ricochet were stripped of the United Gate Championship due to Yoshino being forced to miss Dragon Gate USA's July 2012 events. On May 5, 2013, Yoshino defeated Dragon Kid to win the Open the Brave Gate Championship for the sixth time. He vacated the title on August 30 after he, Chihiro Tominaga and Ryotsu Shimizu lost to the debuting Millennials (T-Hawk, Eita and U-T), saying he felt the title should be competed for within the new generation. On September 12, Naruki Doi turned on Yoshino, signaling the end of World-1 International. Yoshino quickly formed a new stable named Monster Express with Akira Tozawa, Ricochet, Shachihoko Boy, Shingo Takagi and Uhaa Nation. On October 10, Yoshino defeated YAMATO to win the Open the Dream Gate Championship for the second time. On March 2, 2014, Yoshino dropped the Open the Dream Gate Championship to Monster Express stablemate Ricochet. On May 30, 2015, Yoshino defeated T-Hawk in the finals to win the 2015 King of Gate tournament. On June 14, Yoshino defeated BxB Hulk to win the Open the Dream Gate Championship for the third time. He lost the title to Shingo Takagi on August 16. On November 23, 2015, Yoshino defeated Mr. Nakagawa via fan decision the Open the Owarai Gate Championship. He was stripped of the title on April 3 due to failure to defend it within the previous three months. On October 12, Monster Express was forced to disband after losing a match to VerserK.\n\nParagraph 3: Scholars generally attribute the origins of riad gardens in the western Islamic world to its antecedents in the eastern Persian world. The ancient Roman city of Volubilis also provided reference for the beginnings of domestic architecture during the Idrisid Dynasty in Morocco. Important examples of riads, or riad-like gardens, in al-Andalus are found at Madinat al-Zahra (10th century), the Aljaferia (11th century), the Castillejo of Monteagudo (near Murcia, 12th century) and the Alhambra (13th-15th centuries). However, it is unclear to what extent Moroccan riads and houses were inspired by models imported by immigrants from al-Andalus or to what extent they developed locally in parallel with Andalusi versions. What is certain, however, is that there was historically a close cultural and geopolitical relationship between the two lands on either side of the Strait of Gibraltar. When the Almoravids (who were based in Morocco) conquered al-Andalus in the 11th century they commissioned Muslim, Christian and Jewish artisans from al-Andalus to work on monuments in Morocco and throughout their empire, further contributing to a shared architectural and artistic heritage between al-Andalus and North Africa. The earliest known example of a true riad garden (with a symmetrical four-part division) in Morocco was found in the Almoravid palace built by Ali ibn Yusuf in Marrakesh in the early 12th century, which was part of the older Ksar al-Hajjar fortress. The era of the Almoravids and their successor dynasties (such as the Almohads, the Marinids, and the Nasrids) was a formative period of Moroccan architecture and of wider Moorish architecture during which the model of the riad garden was perfected and established as a standard feature of interior secular or palace architecture in the region. It was particularly successful and common in Marrakesh, where the combination of climate and available space made it well-suited to the architecture of the bourgeois mansions and royal palaces built in the city.\n\nParagraph 4: Cells of the genus Oedogonium are narrow and cylindrical in shape. The algal body consists of green, un-branched, and multi-cellular filaments, arranged end to end. Every cell of the filamentous algal body (called the thallus) is similar in shape apart from the apical cell (the uppermost) and the holdfast cell (the lowermost). The apical cell is wider and always rounded at its tip (having a cap) relative to the other cells of the thallus. The holdfast cell, however, produces elongated growths from both unattached sides which aid in firmly attaching the filament to substrate. The holdfast is also the only colourless cell of the filament. All other cells in the filament exist as green structures very similar in nature, with only some cells having caps. The number of caps per cell illustrates the number of times that cell has divided. Every cell of the filament has a cell wall consisting of three layers â the innermost is made of cellulose, the middle of pectose, and the outermost is made of chitin. These three layers provide rigidity and protection for these benthic species. Most cells are attached to the substrate by the holdfast and are vegetative cells, although some are free-floating.Species of Oedogonium are divided into two major groups based on distribution of the sex organs: macrandous and nannandrous species. Macrandous species have a male sex organ (the antheridia) and female sex organ (the oogonia) produced on filaments of normal size. This group is further subdivided into macrandous monoecious and macrandous dioecious. In macrandous monoecious species, the antheridia and oogonia are always found on the same filament. In contrary, in macrandous dioecious species, the antheridia and oogonia are produced on different filaments. Although filaments bearing antheridia and oogonia are morphologically similar, they differ physiologically. In nannandrous species, filaments producing antheridia and oogonia show morphological distinction. The antheridia, which are much smaller than the oogonia, are called dwarf male. Nannandrous species are always dioecious; i.e. antheridia and oogonia are always produced on different filaments. Small male filaments are likely to be attached to a female filament, near an oogonium.\n\nParagraph 5: Promotion for the album began on 4 May 2002 with a secret fan-club show. Suede played to one hundred fans at their London rehearsal studio the Depot. The secret gig coincided with the tenth anniversary release of debut single \"The Drowners\", which was marked by an earlier club night at the Liquid Rooms in King's  Cross. Fans were then transported to the rehearsals in two buses where the band performed fifteen songs, including eight new songs from the new album. The album was released 30 September 2002 and peaked at number 24, which is the lowest chart position of all the band's studio albums, and the only album not to chart in the top ten. The album remains the only studio album from Suede's catalogue not to be released in the US. The lead single for the album was \"Positivity\", which received a large amount of criticism from fans and the press. NME writer Julian Marshall wrote that \"Positivity\" was \"[G]reeted with an apathetic shrug by everyone but the most devoted.\" Although it peaked at No. 16 on the charts and Anderson initially felt happy about the song, his feelings towards it would change in time. He later said of \"Positivity\" that \"When I first wrote it I thought it was a masterpiece but soon realized that many people were genuinely offended by it.\" \"Obsessions\" was the second single released and despite being better received than \"Positivity\", the song charted at a lower position and was ultimately the final single released from the album. The album had first-week sales of 10,152 units, and went on to sell 21,943 units after 12 weeks.\n\nParagraph 6: Cells of the genus Oedogonium are narrow and cylindrical in shape.

He said that although the band's sample-based EPs are just as essential, \"it's the band's irreverent genius and the meticulous arrangements on D. I. Go Pop that stick in your mind the longest\" and commented that \"unlike that grouchy landlady [featured at the end of the album], you'll be wanting to turn this music up, not down.\" In the May 2005 issue of Spin, Andrew Beaujon, reviewing Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures, told readers to \"also try\" D. I. Go Pop, describing it as \"English goofballs [finding] beauty in frustration, futility and a computer lab's worth of obsolete machines losing their shit.\" David James of Optimistic Underground said in 2009 that he \"won't try to describe the sounds [on the album] other than, generally speaking, they were far ahead of their time in the use of sampling, presaging everything from Matmos to The Books to Animal Collective's later albums,\" calling it a \"truly worthy yet well-hidden gem.\" Will Hermes of Rolling Stone said the album was a \"shot heard 'round the corner, if that: a lost masterpiece of evocative blur channeling Joy Division's melodic gloom through My Bloody Valentine's blissful noise-swarms, with sample loops outgunning the guitars.\"Tiny Mix Tapes were also very positive, saying \"Disco Inferno simply wanted to shine on us the light of a fundamentally strange hue, a new context in which to enjoy pop music forms. This won't decimate society and crush your religion. It will tweak your eardrums, and may just plant a knowing grin on your face.\" Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork rated the album 9.3/10, saying \"D. I. Go Pop retains the arpeggios and fractured melodicism of their then-recent singles, and adds increasing layers of disorienting samples and paranoia\" and said it was \"nearly as urgent and key\" as the band's sample-based EPs. In 2011, Eye Plug noted that Pitchforks review resulted in a swell of activity across internet message boards, and \"appears to have left a continued wake of interest.\" Andrew Unterberger of Stylus Magazine, although a fan of the album, found it imperfect without the inclusion of several of the songs from the prior EPs, and chose the album for a \"Playing God\" feature for the magazine in which he picked a definitive, personalised track list for the album.\n\nParagraph 8: Dain: Dain was originally a nervous servant to Doom and a member of the Resistance. He was cultured, polite, respectful, and often afraid, yet noble in battle and showing evidence of a great spirit. He saved Lief, Barda, and Jasmine from the Ols, before they knew what an Ol was, and helped them escape from Doom, when Doom held them prisoner for his own reasons. However, Dain was kidnapped by pirates. When the trio later encountered the same pirates, Dain had just freed himself with the help of a polypan, and he came with them to Tora, the magical city. Dain had hoped to meet his parents in Tora, but the city was deserted. He seemed to be all but destroyed by the news, but once they left the city he seemed to feel more hopeful. In the final book, Lief assembles representatives of all seven tribes to pledge loyalty to the heir and thus hope that the Belt will lead them to the heir. It seems clear that Dain is the heir (his name is even made of the same letters as the first king, Adin), but just then he gets kidnapped. Lief picks up his fallen dagger and carries it with him. Knowing that they must get the Belt to the true heir, the team makes plans to get into the city. However, their plans are all anticipated and most of the group is captured. It turns out Dain is not the heir, but a Grade 3 Ol, capable of assuming even inanimate shapes, and sent to spy on the Resistance and eventually on the trio. The fact that he had killed other Ols is not surprising; they were less talented varieties and the Shadow Lord's creations don't have anything resembling a conscience. Ols think only of furthering their own usefulness to the Shadow Lord. The fact that he was an Ol was the reason he was weakened when he entered the magical city of Tora, as its magic weakens evil. In the end, it is the Belt of Deltora itself that destroys Dain.\n\nParagraph 9: \"When I arrived these animals were as common, even in the settled areas, as they are rare today.

His unknown career, as well as his oeuvre, origin and influence are the subject of many years of scientific discussions, although as a result of more recent research, the Master is credited, among others, with Praying Christ from the Church of St. John the Baptist in Malbork (currently in the collection of the local Castle Museum) and is associated with Pieta in the Church of St. Barbara in Krakow. However, the factors complicating the research on the work of the ToruÅ Master are the similarities of many other works in terms of composition, stylistics and ideological content, which were found in various places in Central Europe, hence the \"international\" character of art around 1400. The problem of the origin of the style of ToruÅ's work reflects to a large extent the unresolved issues of the sources of the beautiful style. The Czech Republic with Prague, Silesia with WrocÅaw, France with Paris, Austria with Salzburg and the Rhineland with Cologne are considered to be the main centres that were to shape the style around 1400. The court culture and the Parler's trend are important foundations for the beautiful style, these two tendencies have marked a large part of Europe. The Eastern Pomerania, which belonged to the Teutonic Knights' state, became an important artistic region around 1400, with the artistic centres in Gdansk, Torun, Elblag and the capital of the monastic state - Malbork. A number of works from around 1400 have been preserved in ToruÅ (including St. Mary Magdalene carried by angels from ToruÅ Cathedral), but each of them has its own characteristics, independent of the form of the Beautiful Madonna, with the exception of the Madonna of Good Hope (also known as the Pregnant Madonna) from ToruÅ City Hall, which went missing during the recent war. Researchers emphasize a strong link between the Beautiful Madonna of ToruÅ and the Beautiful Madonna of WrocÅaw, some of them associate both works with the same sculptor. Numerous similarities to the figure from ToruÅ can be observed in the Sternberg Madonna, or the statues of Mary and the Child in Bonn, as well as in GdaÅsk (e.g. PietÃ  in the church of the Blessed Virgin Mary). Apart from ToruÅ, researchers point to Prague as the place of the creation of the Beautiful Madonna. Numerous stone sculptures were made in this city around 1400, including the Beautiful Madonna from ÄeskÃ½ Krumlov (currently in the collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna); however, according to most art historians, this figure has no direct workshop connection with sculptures from Wroclaw and Torun. The capital of the Czech Crown during the reign of the last Luxembourgers, mainly King Wenceslas IV (1378-1419), and his father Charles IV, belonged to the main art centres of Central Europe.\n\nParagraph 11: Reviewing the album for PopMatters, Adrien Begrand was very positive. He said that although the band's sample-based EPs are just as essential, \"it's the band's irreverent genius and the meticulous arrangements on D. I. Go Pop that stick in your mind the longest\" and commented that \"unlike that grouchy landlady [featured at the end of the album], you'll be wanting to turn this music up, not down.\" In the May 2005 issue of Spin, Andrew Beaujon, reviewing Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures, told readers to \"also try\" D. I. Go Pop, describing it as \"English goofballs [finding] beauty in frustration, futility and a computer lab's worth of obsolete machines losing their shit.\" David James of Optimistic Underground said in 2009 that he \"won't try to describe the sounds [on the album] other than, generally speaking, they were far ahead of their time in the use of sampling, presaging everything from Matmos to The Books to Animal Collective's later albums,\" calling it a \"truly worthy yet well-hidden gem.\" Will Hermes of Rolling Stone said the album was a \"shot heard 'round the corner, if that: a lost masterpiece of evocative blur channeling Joy Division's melodic gloom through My Bloody Valentine's blissful noise-swarms, with sample loops outgunning the guitars.\"Tiny Mix Tapes were also very positive, saying \"Disco Inferno simply wanted to shine on us the light of a fundamentally strange hue, a new context in which to enjoy pop music forms. This won't decimate society and crush your religion. It will tweak your eardrums, and may just plant a knowing grin on your face.\" Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork rated the album 9.3/10, saying \"D. I. Go Pop retains the arpeggios and fractured melodicism of their then-recent singles, and adds increasing layers of disorienting samples and paranoia\" and said it was \"nearly as urgent and key\" as the band's sample-based EPs. In 2011, Eye Plug noted that Pitchforks review resulted in a swell of activity across internet message boards, and \"appears to have left a continued wake of interest.\" Andrew Unterberger of Stylus Magazine, although a fan of the album, found it imperfect without the inclusion of several of the songs from the prior EPs, and chose the album for a \"Playing God\" feature for the magazine in which he picked a definitive, personalised track list for the album.\n\nParagraph 12: Reviewing the album for PopMatters, Adrien Begrand was very positive.

Suede played to one hundred fans at their London rehearsal studio the Depot. The secret gig coincided with the tenth anniversary release of debut single \"The Drowners\", which was marked by an earlier club night at the Liquid Rooms in King's  Cross. Fans were then transported to the rehearsals in two buses where the band performed fifteen songs, including eight new songs from the new album. The album was released 30 September 2002 and peaked at number 24, which is the lowest chart position of all the band's studio albums, and the only album not to chart in the top ten. The album remains the only studio album from Suede's catalogue not to be released in the US. The lead single for the album was \"Positivity\", which received a large amount of criticism from fans and the press. NME writer Julian Marshall wrote that \"Positivity\" was \"[G]reeted with an apathetic shrug by everyone but the most devoted.\" Although it peaked at No. 16 on the charts and Anderson initially felt happy about the song, his feelings towards it would change in time. He later said of \"Positivity\" that \"When I first wrote it I thought it was a masterpiece but soon realized that many people were genuinely offended by it.\" \"Obsessions\" was the second single released and despite being better received than \"Positivity\", the song charted at a lower position and was ultimately the final single released from the album. The album had first-week sales of 10,152 units, and went on to sell 21,943 units after 12 weeks.\n\nParagraph 14: The Swedish Princess Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte described him, as well as his family, at the time of a visit in August 1799: Our cousin, the Duke, arrived immediately the next morning. As a noted military man he has won many victories, he is witty, literate and a pleasant acquaintance, but ceremonial beyond description. He is said to be quite strict, but a good father of the nation who attends to the needs of his people. After he left us, I visited the Dowager Duchess, the aunt of my consort. She is an agreeable, highly educated and well respected lady, but by now so old that she has almost lost her memory. From her I continued to the Duchess, sister to the King of England and a typical English woman. She looked very simple, like a vicar's wife, has I am sure many admirable qualities and are very respectable, but completely lacks manners. She makes the strangest questions without considering how difficult and unpleasant they can be. Both the Hereditary Princess as well as Princess Augusta â sister of the sovereign Duke â came to her while I was there. The former is delightful, mild, lovable, witty and clever, not a beauty but still very pretty. In addition, she is said to be admirably kind to her boring consort. The Princess Augusta is full of wit and energy and very amusing. [...] The Duchess and the Princesses followed me to Richmond, the country villa of the Duchess a bit outside of town. It was small and pretty with a beautiful little park, all in an English style. As she had the residence constructed herself, it amuses her to show it to others. [...] The sons of the Ducal couple are somewhat peculiar. The Hereditary Prince, chubby and fat, almost blind, strange and odd â if not to say an imbecile â attempts to imitate his father but only makes himself artificial and unpleasant. He talks continually, does not know what he says and is in all aspects unbearable. He is accommodating but a poor thing, loves his consort to the point of worship and is completely governed by her. The other son, Prince Georg, is the most ridiculous person imaginable, and so silly that he can never be left alone but is always accompanied by a courtier. The third son is also described as an original. I never saw him, as he served with his regiment. The fourth one is the only normal one, but also torments his parents by his immoral behavior. \n\nParagraph 15: It is favored among beekeepers for several reasons, not the least being its ability to defend itself successfully against insect pests while at the same time being extremely gentle in its behavior toward beekeepers. These bees are particularly adept at adjusting worker population to nectar availability.  It relies on these rapid adjustments of population levels to rapidly expand worker bee populations after nectar becomes available in the spring, and, again, to rapidly cut off brood production when nectar ceases to be available in quantity. It meets periods of high nectar with high worker populations and consequently stores large quantities of honey and pollen during those periods. They are resistant to some diseases and parasites that can debilitate hives of other subspecies.\n\nParagraph 16: It is favored among beekeepers for several reasons, not the least being its ability to defend itself successfully against insect pests while at the same time being extremely gentle in its behavior toward beekeepers.

His unknown career, as well as his oeuvre, origin and influence are the subject of many years of scientific discussions, although as a result of more recent research, the Master is credited, among others, with Praying Christ from the Church of St. John the Baptist in Malbork (currently in the collection of the local Castle Museum) and is associated with Pieta in the Church of St. Barbara in Krakow. However, the factors complicating the research on the work of the ToruÅ Master are the similarities of many other works in terms of composition, stylistics and ideological content, which were found in various places in Central Europe, hence the \"international\" character of art around 1400. The problem of the origin of the style of ToruÅ's work reflects to a large extent the unresolved issues of the sources of the beautiful style. The Czech Republic with Prague, Silesia with WrocÅaw, France with Paris, Austria with Salzburg and the Rhineland with Cologne are considered to be the main centres that were to shape the style around 1400. The court culture and the Parler's trend are important foundations for the beautiful style, these two tendencies have marked a large part of Europe. The Eastern Pomerania, which belonged to the Teutonic Knights' state, became an important artistic region around 1400, with the artistic centres in Gdansk, Torun, Elblag and the capital of the monastic state - Malbork. A number of works from around 1400 have been preserved in ToruÅ (including St. Mary Magdalene carried by angels from ToruÅ Cathedral), but each of them has its own characteristics, independent of the form of the Beautiful Madonna, with the exception of the Madonna of Good Hope (also known as the Pregnant Madonna) from ToruÅ City Hall, which went missing during the recent war. Researchers emphasize a strong link between the Beautiful Madonna of ToruÅ and the Beautiful Madonna of WrocÅaw, some of them associate both works with the same sculptor. Numerous similarities to the figure from ToruÅ can be observed in the Sternberg Madonna, or the statues of Mary and the Child in Bonn, as well as in GdaÅsk (e.g. PietÃ  in the church of the Blessed Virgin Mary). Apart from ToruÅ, researchers point to Prague as the place of the creation of the Beautiful Madonna. Numerous stone sculptures were made in this city around 1400, including the Beautiful Madonna from ÄeskÃ½ Krumlov (currently in the collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna); however, according to most art historians, this figure has no direct workshop connection with sculptures from Wroclaw and Torun. The capital of the Czech Crown during the reign of the last Luxembourgers, mainly King Wenceslas IV (1378-1419), and his father Charles IV, belonged to the main art centres of Central Europe.\n\nParagraph 19: Roggenkamp's first published \"novel\" appeared only in 2004.   \"Familienleben\" (\"Family life\"), which can be described as an \"autobiographically inspired novel\", was well received by leading critics.   Recommended to television viewers by the influential presenter and literary critic Elke Heidenreich, it quickly proved a commercial success, notwithstanding its unfashionable length.   It runs to more than 400 pages and has been translated into a number of different languages.   The narrator-protagonist is a 13 year-old child called Fania.   Fania is the younger of the parents' two daughters.   The narrative deals with the daily life of a German-Jewish family living in Hamburg in 1967.   In her powerfully positive review of the book in Der Spiegel, Jana Hensel provides a little context:  \"For three decades Viola Roggenkamp kept her project for a novel to herself.   The result, now, is an almost eerily perfect book ... All the characters in it are perfectly defined with great dramatic clarity, replete with their psychological contradictions\".   The relationship between holocaust survivors and their children in Germany was the underlying theme both of \"Familienleben\" and of Roggenkamp's next book, \"Die Frau im Turm\" (\"The woman in the tower\") which appeared in 2009.    \"Tochter und Vater\" (2011) again incorporated as its starting point and at its core, the author's own experiences, and what she had discerned of her parents' lives in Silesia during the war.   Her mother was dead by the time she started writing this third book, and had, with tact but also evident difficulty, refrained from asking questions about the earlier work, \"Familienleben\" after Viola had admitted that she was writing it.   Nevertheless, the author sent her mother a copy in the mail and was surprised by the reaction:  \"After she read the book, she told me she was surprised to discover that I was aware of the trauma she carried with her. She always thought she protected me and my sister from all that.\"   The three books driven by her own experiences of growing up as the child of holocaust survivors in Hamburg only came after years of soul searching and quiet enquiry about the experiences of German Jews who had grown up in Germany as the children of holocaust survivors.  By the end of the twentieth century there had been plenty published by then children of parents who had perpetrated holocaust killings and other acts of persecution -  or simply quietly colluded, taking care not to follow up the rumours of what was going on in the camps.   But there had been virtual silence from the children in Germany of holocaust survivors who simply wanted to forget, and lived under the shadow of a deeply entrenched terror that somehow, it could all happen again one day.   There were, in any case, not too many holocaust survivors who had ended up bringing up children still living in Germany.   From the perspective of a writer with insights to share, as Roggenkamp has told at least one interviewer, her \"family suffered, but [she is] lucky to have [her] non-typical background.\"   But her experiences are nevertheless in many respects far from unique:  before publishing the three books based on her own childhood experiences she had already, in 2002, published \"Tu mir eine Liebe. Meine Mamme\" (loosely, \"Be a love...  My mummy\").   The subtitle is more enlightening than the main title:  \"JÃ¼dische Frauen und MÃ¤nner in Deutschland sprechen von ihrer Mutter\" (\"Jewish women and men in Germany talk about their mothers\").   The volume is based on 26 interview-portraits in which higher-profile Germans talk about their mothers, all of whom are holocaust survivors.   The interviewees include Stefan Heym, Esther Dischereit, Wladimir Kaminer, Rachel Salamander, Stefanie Zweig, and Michael Wolffsohn. Most of these are members of Roggenkamp's own generation or younger, and so unable to remember the holocaust on their own account:  yet all of them have had their lives defined by the holocaust, primarily through the effect the experiences of it had on their mothers.   Survivor guilt is, perhaps, the most frequently recurring of the Leitmotiven identified in the interviews.   Prior to the volume's publication the interview-portraits had already been published individually in JÃ¼dische Allgemeine.\n\nParagraph 20: It is favored among beekeepers for several reasons, not the least being its ability to defend itself successfully against insect pests while at the same time being extremely gentle in its behavior toward beekeepers.

Beginning immediately in the 1930s with his ascension to the leadership of the TWU, he had made it a point not to tolerate any kind of racial discrimination under his watch. From the outset, the TWU vowed to support workers âregardless of race, creed, color or nationalityâ, making it an anomaly in the still racially segregated America and amongst other Trade Unions in New York City. The TWU matched their words with action in 1938 when the Union supported the rights of Black transit workers. At that time, Black workers could only work as either porters or cleaners, but the TWU forced the IRT to allow black workers to better positions within the company. In 1939 the TWU held the first desegregated trade union meeting in New Orleans since the Reconstruction era. In 1941 Quill pledged to fight to see that âthe color-line is wiped out . . . and that the Negro and white workers will have equal rights in this countryâ. Two years later he spoke at dozens of workplace meetings in New York, warning of the consequences for all workers of the wave of race riots then occurring in the US. In 1945 the TWU ran a nationwide campaign against lynching.  \n\nParagraph 22: Wilde transforms the dance from a public performance for his guests, as in the Bible, to a personal dance for the king himself. He gives no description of the dance beyond the name, but the idea of a series of veils has been connected to a process of unveiling. As Malik says, \"although Wilde does not describe Salome's dance or suggest that she remove any veils, her dance is invariably assumed to be one of unveiling, thus revealing herself.\" Wilde's play has even been proposed as the origin of striptease. Toni Bentley writes \"Wilde's bracketed brevity allowed for a world of interpretation. Can the invention of striptease be traced to a single innocuous stage direction in a censored play that could barely find a theater or audience? Can Oscar Wilde be considered the unlikely father of modern striptease?\"\n\nPlease enter the final count of unique paragraphs after removing duplicates.

Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: Art director Brentan Harron first began conceptualising the interior and exterior of a new Asgard ship for the episode as part of season 5, although at this stage the ship was intended for the half-human, half-Asgard character Odin. Eventually, after the story was redeveloped for the shows seventh season, Odin was replaced with a different character, a renegade Asgard named Loki. The production design team abandoned their original concept drawings and started fresh on a new Asgard ship in season 7. Art director Peter Bodnarus explained that the design for their new Asgard ship was \"something a little more organic\" than some of the more \"stark and compartmentalised\" technology and ships which had previously featured.  Production designer Bridget McQuire's principle idea was \"tooth-like pylons\", which Bodnarus and Robbins developed drawings of. These designs were then given to a company with a numerical control device which was used to precisely carve pieces of foam to form the ship. Bodnarus described the process of cutting pieces of foam from three different axes in order to form \"an extremely elegant shape from which to work\". Elements such as pylons and observational turrets were crafted, with the overall intention of creating something \"a race as advanced as the Asgard would have built\". For the Asgard probe onboard the ship, McGuire explained that they wanted to make \"something quite threatening and scary looking that could be suspended over a person\". The probe was originally only going to appear in flashback sequences, but eventually this was expanded, with it appearing in more scenes and thus it needed to be more detailed. Existing Asgard set pieces, such as the Asgard medical pod from \"Nemesis\", and other pieces from \"Small Victories\" were used to dress the Asgard laboratory, which was constructed on Stage 6 of The Bridge Studios.\n\nParagraph 2: In 1908 the school only had one male teacher â Art master, Alfred Bamford.  In January 1910 the School Hostel opened in rented premises under the care of a Mrs Smylie to allow students with long journeys between home and school to stay in Chelmsford during the week.  The school remained open throughout World War I, with forms being assigned \"shelter\" in a place away from windows or an outer wall. It also took in refugee students from Belgium and educated them. In June 1916 Winifred Picking became the School's first University success when she gained a First Class degree in the Natural Science Tripos at Girton College, Cambridge. The school's motto \"Vitai lampada ferimus\" or \" We carry the torch of life\" was chosen in 1923, which is part of the school crest.  In 1936 the School Hostel shut down due to lack of viability, due to improved transport around Chelmsford.  A year later, in 1937, the electric bell system was first installed. It was removed in 1999.  The school remained open during World War II, though this time the school was damaged several times in air raids. Fortunately the worst raid, when nearly every window in the school was broken, occurred during a school holiday. Maintaining examination conditions during air raids was also a problem: eventually exam candidates were given their own separate shelter.  Extensive building work was initiated in the 1950s and continued throughout the 1960s â in that time, the current caretaker's house, swimming pool, hall, canteen, art rooms, and library were built. In February 1962, HRH Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother arrived on the School grounds by helicopter to be guest of honour at the Senior Speech Day, which was held at Chelmsford Cathedral. The introduction of Technology, particularly IT, began in the 1980s.  In 1992, CCHS became a Grant Maintained school with control over its own funds, and a School Bursar was employed. Margaret Thatcher, along with the local MP Simon Burns, paid a brief visit to the school on 30 March 1992. Building work continued with the development of the new school Astroturf pitch in 2004, the extension of the sixth form common room in 2005, and new music centre in 2007, which has been built in the shape of an orchestra, including a fully equipped recording studio. The building was opened in January 2008 by Dame Evelyn Glennie.  In 2007 the School celebrated its Centenary, with HRH Sophie, Countess of Wessex.  The school converted to academy status on 1 January 2011. In 2013 the new Languages Centre was completed, which has brought language learning into the 21st century.  In 2015 and in 2020 the governors of the School voted unanimously to expand CCHS by 30 each time, increasing the intake to 180, the decision was taken in response to the ever-increasing demand for places at the School and a desire to offer the opportunity to be educated in a grammar school to even more girls.\n\nParagraph 3: In October 2002, the first international tournament in England was held in Chester, the British Isles Nations Futsal Cup. It was hosted by Tranmere Victoria, with four other teams representing Ireland, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Gibraltar. Shortly after the tournament Tranmere Victoria played a friendly match against Iran. In November 2002, an English Futsal Championship tournament took place and was won by Pendle Santos. Two weeks later a pilot national tournament was organised by the Sheffield Hallamshire FA. Ten teams took part and there was also a women's invitation match. Tranmere Victoria won the tournament and as a result were later chosen by the FA to be the first team to represent England in the UEFA Futsal Cup. Both the FA and FIFA had representatives at the tournament, there were also members of the British Universities Sport's Association present. The future of futsal in England was discussed and the FIFA representative stated that they would support the FA in developing the refereeing and coaching programmes necessary for the development of the game in England. The possibility of establishing a national team was also discussed. In early 2003 it was revealed that the first official national cup was to be organised by the FA and would take place during the summer. Regional qualifying leagues were set up independently of the FA in Sheffield, Pendle, Wirral, London, Cheltenham and Grimsby, with the winners and runners-up qualifying for the FA Futsal Cup. Prior to the tournament was the 2003 London Cup. The first FA Futsal Cup took place in July at the Army Physical Training Centre in Aldershot, with teams divided into two groups of six. An invitation was also extended to an Army team, as the Army Football Association. Sheffield Hallam won the cup and would enter as England's representatives in the 2004â05 UEFA Futsal Cup.\n\nParagraph 4: Orbit was a series of anthologies of new science fiction edited by Damon Knight, often featuring work by such writers as Gene Wolfe, Joanna Russ, R. A. Lafferty, and Kate Wilhelm. The anthologies tended toward the avant-garde edge of science fiction, but by no means exclusively; occasionally the volumes featured nonfiction critical writing or humorous anecdotes by Knight.  Inspired by Frederik Pohl's Star Science Fiction series, and in its turn an influence on other original speculative fiction anthologies, it ran for over a decade and twenty-one volumes, not including a 1975 \"Best of\" collection selected from the first ten volumes.\n\nParagraph 5: June 8 - at least four unrated probable tornadoes touched down in Ontario. The first probable tornado touched down in Hamilton, Ontario, uprooting trees, damaging roofs, and destroying a sailboat. A second probable tornado started near Rodney, Ontario where it destroyed the roof of the Binder Hotel before continuing through/near West Lorne, Ontario, Dutton, Ontario, Shedden, Ontario and Fingal, Ontario before ending in St. Thomas, Ontario where a roof of the Michigan Central Railroad was destroyed and nearly all trees on Wellington Street were damaged or destroyed. Damage in some of the nearby towns mentioned before could have been from the outer edges, more in the style of a downburst associated with the thunderstorm, but without proper record keeping as in the modern era, this can all be classified under one tornadic event. A third tornado touched down in Chatham, Ontario causing significant tree damage across the city. The tower of the Methodist church collapsed, the peak was knocked off the school, skylights were blown out, smokestacks of several local factories were also destroyed. Various houses were destroyed. This tornado likely dissipated before touching down again as the Rodney, Ontario to St. Thomas, Ontario tornado. In Sarnia, Ontario, a fourth probable tornado touched down destroying 150 square feet of roofing on a new lumber mill. Numerous trees were destroyed while a house was lifted off its foundation and tossed. Based on the damage reported, the tornado started near the St. Clair River causing damage along Christina Street, Johnston Street, and Queen Street before moving across Wellington Street and causing damage along Davis Street. The tornado began to weaken before causing minor damage on Russell Street. Additional damage was reported in Port Stanley, Ontario where a ninety-foot elevator tower collapsed and in Niagara Falls, Ontario. There is inconclusive information to determine the classification of the event in Port Stanley, Ontario and Niagara Falls, Ontario.\n\nParagraph 6: SADF electronic warfare operations intercepted FAPLA communications on 22 March which indicated that FAPLA wanted to retake the Chambinga heights. These high grounds lay east in front of the Tumpo triangle and the SADF positions. SADF decided to go ahead with the operation planned for 23 March. On the night of 22 March, around 21h00, the SADF units began to line up and prepare for the attack, which would begin the next morning. As they moved forward during the night, the columns became temporarily lost and then had to continue their advance with only one tank de-miner when the other overturned. Around 04h00 on 23 March, SADF G-5 artillery began to bombard the forward positions of the 25 Brigade. By 06h00 the SADF attack column was within 10Â km of the FAPLA positions but had soon stopped as they were delayed by bad terrain and one of the tanks had broken down. Once the repair was completed the attack resumed around 08h15. Not long after the attack column began moving again, a tank hit a mine and the de-miner tank sent forward to clear the minefield was itself permanently disabled by a mine, unable to be moved. The column halted and sappers were brought forward to clear a way through the minefield with their Plofadders, an automated rocket-fired explosive de-miner. They failed to work and they had to be manually detonated, which delayed the operation by three hours. Clearing of the minefields also attracted the attention of the Cuban artillery, which fired on the SADF column but was ineffective in hitting targets but slowed any progress they wished to make. During this time, UNITA fought a battle with elements of 38 Brigade on the high ground they captured earlier during the month, but they and the SADF forward observers were chased off it.\n\nParagraph 7: Daniel \"Dan\" T. Griswold (born 1958) is a senior research Fellow and co-director of the Program on the American Economy and Globalization at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. He was previously the president of the National Association of Foreign-Trade Zones, an organization based in Washington DC. Prior to NAFTZ, he served as the director of the Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies, where he authored numerous studies on trade and immigration policy. Before joining Cato in 1997, Griswold served as press secretary for Congressman Vin Weber of Minnesota, and later for 12 years as editorial page editor of the Colorado Springs Gazette-Telegraph. He has written for major newspapers such as The Wall Street Journal and the Los Angeles Times, appeared on CNN, PBS, C-SPAN and other national TV and radio networks, and testified before congressional committees. He was born in a small Midwestern town, graduated from the University of WisconsinâMadison with a bachelor's degree in journalism and economics, and received a master's degree in the Politics of the World Economy from the London School of Economics. Griswold has written extensively on such subjects as immigration reform and the U.S. balance of trade. He also authored the book Mad about Trade: Why Main Street America Should Embrace Globalization, published in 2009. He lives with his wife, Elizabeth, in Northern Virginia.\n\nParagraph 8: The Hidden Valley Kings are a neighborhood-based gang in Charlotte, North Carolina. It was formed in the late 1990s, as a branch of the Queen City Kings, which started in the Cedar Greene housing complex, east of Hidden Valley, near the streets of Craighead and North Tryon.  The Queen City Kings were formed by a People Nation member who moved to Charlotte from Chicago in the mid 1990s. He initially established a People Nation faction in the Cedar Greene Apartment Complex but as a way to be inclusive of the growing Folk Nation influence within the growing Supreme King Queen Nation, an agreement was made by all parties involved to change the name of the gang to the Queen City Kings, which played on the nickname of the City of Charlotte, which people dub the \"Queen City.\" The name, according to the Original Kings, was the gang's affirmation to the claiming of the city, stating: \"The Queen City is our bitch, which makes us the Kings.\" Shortly thereafter, he was incarcerated on an unrelated offense. A Cedar Greene Apartments resident named \"Korn,\" along with Korn's half-brother, was left in charge; Korn proved to be a very charismatic and dedicated leader, remaining loyal to the movement until his suicide, several years later. The Kings, which originally stood for Knowledgeable Islamic Nubian Gods, then renamed Krucial Islamic Nubian Gods,  was meant to be a Charlotte, home-grown version of the Chicago gangs. The Kings were structured similar to the Los Angeles gangs, but instead of \"Original Gangsta\" (OG) or \"Baby Gangsta\" (BG) the Queen City Kings used \"Original King\" (OK) or \"Baby King\" (BK). The Kings color is black but the Hidden Valley Kings wear the color green for their neighborhood, the Hidden Valley neighborhood sign is green and Hidden Valley Elementary school colors are green. Just as the nations in Chicago had different branches, or \"sets,\" the Queen City Kings had a number of small sets as well. These sets were actually small groups of members who lived in different Charlotte communities, who were dedicated to spreading the Kingz to each of these neighborhoods. Some of them were successful but many of them were unknown in their respective neighborhoods. Among the factions were the Wilmore Kings (WMK), Tuckaseegee Kings (TSK), Beatties Ford Kings (BFK), Maple Run Kings (MRK), North Side Jamaican Kings (NJK), Westside Kings (WSK) the Creek Town Kings (CTK or FOC), The Cedar Greene Kings (CGK), the Woodview Kings (WVK),  the Hidden Valley Kings (HVK) among others of these various sets, the Hidden Valley Kings became the most prominent.\n\nParagraph 9: In general short term fluctuations in the price of uranium are of more concern to operators and owners of mines and potentially lucrative deposits than to power plant operators. Due to its high energy density, uranium is easy to stockpile in the form of strategic reserves and thus a short term increase in prices can be compensated by accessing those reserves. Furthermore, many countries have de facto reserves in the form of reprocessed uranium or depleted uranium which still contain a share of fissile material that can make re-enrichment worthwhile if market conditions call for it. Nuclear reprocessing of spent fuel is - as of the 2020s - done commercially primarily to use the fissile material still contained in spent fuel. The commonly employed PUREX process recovers uranium and plutonium which can then be converted into MOX-fuel for use in the same light water reactors that produced the spent fuel. Whether reprocessing is economical is subject to much debate and depends in part on assumptions as to the price of uranium and the cost of disposal via deep geological repository or nuclear transmutation. Reactors that can run on natural uranium consume less mined uranium per unit of power produced but can have higher capital costs to build due to the need for heavy water as moderator. Furthermore they need to be capable of online refueling because the burnup achievable with natural uranium is lower than that achievable with enriched uranium - having to shut down the entire reactor for every refueling would quickly make such a reactor uneconomic. Breeder reactors also become more economical as uranium prices rise and it was among other things a decline in uranium prices in the 1970s that led to a decline in interest in breeder reactor technology. The thorium fuel cycle is a further alternative if and when uranium prices remain at a sustained high level and consequently interest in this alternative to current \"mainstream\" light water reactor technology is dependent in no small part on uranium prices.\n\nParagraph 10: Reaction to the album has been generally favorable. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 67, based on 6 reviews, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\". Slant Magazine critic Jonathan Keefe awarded the album three out of five stars and stated that Shout It Out \"is the trio's most ambitious project\" and that it \"includes a few moments of real inspiration.\" Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine also rated the album three out of five stars in a more mixed review. Erlewine remarked that, \"Hanson are sharp enough to keep things tight... but the music itself is too finely honed.\" A review from AbsolutePunk surmises that, \"Aside from the trio's penchant for maudlin and borderline campy lyrics, there's little about Shout it Out that isn't infectious\". The Entertainment Weekly review praised the album, claiming: \"Uptempo jams like Waiting for This shimmer with top-shelf songcraft; Motown vet Bob Babbitt even sits in on bass. But sometimes you wish these whiz kids would act their age\". QRO said the album \"may just be okay, but it's at the highest tier of okay. It's not a great album, but it's not trying to be either; it plays to its audience, and it does it well.\" Jonathan Keefe from Slant Magazine was, somewhat, favorable in his review, saying:\"What's encouraging about the record, though, is that Hanson's instincts are more or less on point. The effervescent brass sections, aggressive rhythm tracks, and AM-radio vibe they've incorporated are all logical and effective additions to their aesthetic. That Hanson has been around for well over a decade now makes it easy to forget that they're still a young band. And the elements that really work on Shout It Out suggest that they're only going to continue to get better\". Connor McKnight from Billboard was largely positive, writing: \"Long before the first Jonas Brothers album hit the shelves, another sibling trio reigned supreme. Hanson brothers Isaac, Taylor and Zac may still be widely known for their playful 1997 pop hit, \"MMMBop,\" but the trio's fifth studio album, \"Shout It Out,\" shows that the group continues to expand its musical roots. A colorful set that pays tribute to the funk, soul and R&B musical influences that shapes its sound, \"Shout It Out\" has a sunnier vibe than the group's 2007 predecessor, \"The Walk.\" \"Shout It Out\" still breaks into emotional territory with piano ballads like \"Use Me Up\" (featuring Zac on lead vocals), while Taylor's windy tenor shines on \"Carry You There.\" From the profoundly upbeat single \"Thinking 'Bout Something'\" to the heartfelt and introspective closer \"Me Myself and I,\" \"Shout It Out\" is a fun listen that beams with genuine talent and creative artistry\".\n\nParagraph 11: Founded as Leeds St. Johns in 1895 the club is now known as the Leeds Rhinos have a long history. In recent years the team has competed in several major finals. Under coach Graham Murray they competed in the first Super League grand final in 1998 but were defeated by Wigan Warriors. A year later Leeds won the Rugby League Challenge Cup, defeating London Broncos at Wembley in the last final held at Wembley stadium before its re-building. After several years without a trophy the appointment of Tony Smith of coach saw Leeds top the league at the end of the season and went on to be crowned Super League champions on 16 October 2004 after defeating arch rivals Bradford Bulls 16â8 at Old Trafford. In 2005 the Rhinos reached the final of both the Challenge Cup and the Super League but lost both games to Hull F.C. and Bradford Bulls respectively.  Leeds now hold the 2007 crown after thrashing former champions St Helens 33â6 in the Grand Final.  This was Coach Tony Smith's final game before leaving to be G.B coach and this win makes it two grand final trophies in four years. They won the next two super league grand finals, topping the regular season league table in the latter, setting a record for the most consecutive grand final wins. They also won the crown in 2011, coming from 5th place after the regular season rounds. The team reached the challenge cup final for the first time at the redeveloped Wembley Stadium in 2010, and then again in 2011, losing out 6â30 to the Warrington Wolves and then 18â28 to Wigan Warriors. Leeds Rhinos are the best supported Rugby League club in the United Kingdom, their Headingley ground holds up to 20,500 spectators and is regularly filled, with sell out's particularly common, at games against Bradford Bulls, St. Helens and Wigan Warriors. Leeds-based Tetley's Bitter, Leeds Building Society, Jet2 and Leeds Carnegie are all major sponsors of the Leeds Rhinos.\n\nParagraph 12: Between 1944 and 1951, Tierney was arrested over 12 times in Los Angeles for brawling, frequently for drunkenness which included ripping a public telephone off a wall in a bar, hitting a waiter in the face with a sugar bowl for refusing to serve him any more drinks, and attempting to choke a taxi driver.  He was jailed for three months for brawling in May 1947 and again in June 1949 and drunkenness in January 1949 and October 1950. His legal troubles included a 90-day jail sentence which he served from August to October 1951 for breaking a New York college student's jaw during another barroom brawl. He served 66 days in the city jail in Chicago, Illinois from March to May 1952 for drunk and disorderly charges. In October 1951, he was sent to a mental hospital in Chicago after being found disheveled in a church. In New York City, he was arrested for assault and battery of a barroom pianist in August 1953 and again in October 1958 for resisting arrest and assaulting two police officers in another barroom brawl. At the time of his October 1958 arrest outside a Manhattan bar, The New York Times reported that he had been arrested six times in California and five in New York City on similar charges.\n\nParagraph 13: Roxxon is revealed to be orchestrating the young superheroes being falsely outlawed by the public. Having acquired the dragons from War of the Realms event, their first step was to get rid of the high schooler Aliana Kabua. Although Kamala Khan got injured from saving Aliana, Roxxon begin to shift the blame to the Champions for the damage they never started. While forming a partnership with Senator Geoffrey Patrick and C.R.A.D.L.E., Roxxon manipulates them into unknowingly furthering their shady businesses, such as permanent imprisonment, brainwashing and unethical experimentation, as well as possibly kidnapping of the kids who oppose the unjust law. Viv Vision, who survived Roxxon's assault on Aliana, had been monitoring her fellow younger superheroes, but discovers that she is unintentionally selling her friends to C.R.A.D.L.E. and Roxxon. Once the Champions reveals Roxxon's conspiracy to Senator Patrick and the public, the senator finally begins to repeal the unjust law, ending the partnership with Roxxon, and clearing Kamala's name while re-evaluating his business dealings. Later, Miles Morales and Sam Alexander go undercover as interns, prior to being suggested to hire Kamala Kahn. While Roxxon attempts to cover up their illegal activity by releasing a social app called \"Roxx-On\", a Champion and a former prisoner of C.R.A.D.L.E.'s harassment, Snowguard rallies a group of mobs because they still openly do not trust Roxxon for their previous activities. Much worst, Roxxon already hired Ironheart's nemesis from Stark Unlimited, Andre Sims, in an attempt to collect data to dispose of those who are deemed threats to its business. He replaced young superheroes with his Chaperon robots to ensure the unjust Kamala's Law remains active. During Roxx-On concert, Roxxon lost its public trust thanks to Kamala's public speech about the company's ongoing shady business, thus repealing Kamala's Law and disbanding C.R.A.D.L.E.. However, Roxxon's reputation becomes worst when Andre attempts to dispose of young people like the Champions because of his personal issues, but is immediately stopped by Roxxon's higher-up Miriam Blakemoore. After that, Roxxon finally makes a public speech to apologize for their actions and takes responsibility for Andre's crime.\n\nParagraph 14: Prior to 1915, the state had no central authority governing construction and maintenance of roads. The governor, legislature, other road associations, and local governments all attempted to serve these tasks, leading to a lack of planning and management. In 1915, a State Highway Commission was created to organize transportation services. The original commission consisted of six volunteer members. As responsibilities of the commission grew, this became inadequate, and in 1919 the commission was replaced with three paid members. By 1922, roads in Tennessee were behind surrounding states. Governor Austin Peay created a new Department of Highways and Public Works and appointed J.G. Creveling, Jr. as the single commissioner. Peavy also implemented a tax of two cents per gallon to fund the new department. The collapse of the banking system in 1930 resulted in significant losses for the state and led to an inability to fund the department. All of its workers had to be released. However, in 1933 the New Deal projects gave $11 million of federal money for highway projects. Diversion of federal funds and military enlistment of personnel during World War II again crippled the department. Following the war, the construction of the new Interstate Highway system brought a massive boom to the department. In 1972, due to its expanding role in all modes of transportation, it was renamed the Tennessee Department of Transportation. In the 1980s, TDOT began the $3.3 billion Better Roads Program to clear a backlog of projects and improve aging roads. In 1989, the gas tax was set at 21.40 cents per gallon to help fund this project. Through the 1990s and early 2000s, the department began working on ways to improve efficiency and involve communities.\n\nParagraph 15: Left unprotected by Cincinnati in the 1992 MLB Expansion Draft, Hoffman was selected by the Florida Marlins with the eighth pick in the first round. In his first major league season in 1993, Hoffman learned by observing Marlins closer Bryan Harvey's balanced demeanor. After earning two saves in 29 appearances with the Marlins as an unknown rookie, Hoffman was traded midseason to the San Diego Padres during San Diego's 1993 fire sale. The Padres sent third baseman Gary Sheffield and pitcher Rich Rodriguez to the Marlins for Hoffman and pitching prospects JosÃ© MartÃ­nez and AndrÃ©s Berumen. Padres general manager Randy Smith said at the time, \"The only way to acquire quality players is to give up quality.\" The year before, Sheffield had won the NL batting title and made a run at the Triple Crown. Smith insisted that Florida include Hoffman in the deal. Padres fans, upset at the trade, booed Hoffman during his first several appearances. He allowed three runs in his one-inning debut with San Diego, eight runs over his first three outings, and blew his first save opportunity as a Padre. He pitched 39 games for San Diego, who finished the season with 101 losses, and ended his rookie season with 79 strikeouts in 90 innings with a 3.90 ERA and five saves.\n\nParagraph 16: During the conquest of southern Italy, Hollenbeck moved northward with the troops and was one of the first correspondents to begin broadcasting from Naples when the Army Signal Corps set up transmitters for the correspondents. But at Salerno he was stricken with malaria, then with jaundice and ordered back home:       The first big event for me in covering the news over there was at Salerno, just south of the town. I'll never forget it! We were on a headquarters ship and had put the commanding officer ashore, then for a while feared we couldn't get the rest of the people off. We were under heavy fire, so had to back off and spend that morning shuttling back and forth in the bay with German aircraft overhead and German '88' guns on shore, and behind us our own destroyers and cruisers bombarding the shore positions, so it was not a very pleasant cruise we had around the gulf of Salerno... I had a wire recorder with me and was on top of the landing craft trying to make some records at the time.       Asked what kind of protection there was after these forces had landed, Hollenbeck replied:       You hope there is air cover. We had difficulty that way because our forces were based in Sicily. They had to fly all the way, and it didn't give them very much gas to spend over our heads. We looked for those planes most of the time.       From Stars and Stripes September 20, 1943:       Don Hollenbeck of NBC sent back from Italy one of the most dramatic recordings we've ever heard. Against a backdrop of gunfire Don gave a vivid description of the bitter battle raging about him as he stood on the shore with microphone in hand and a portable recorder on his back. Interviews with the boys engaged in the fight were outstanding.  A wire recorder was used for this broadcast from the beach at Salerno. On the hair-fine thread of steel wound on that small spool every sound of battle was inscribed, then relayed to Algiers and short-waved to the United States on September 17. In such fashion history is chronicled today with complete fidelity even while in the making, and that in itself is history.\n\nParagraph 17: Indonesia is said to have the largest cassette industry in the world. Given the country's cultural and ethnic diversity, the recording industry, and the cassette industry in particular, has displayed great complexity in its structure and in how it serves the many ethnically distinct regions of the country. While the CD and the advent of digital technology has affected the production, dissemination and consumption of Indonesian popular music, cassette tapes remain the preferred source of recorded popular music for most Indonesians. The continued viability of the cassette medium in Indonesia springs from the fact that an audio cassette and the technology required to play itâ-a simple cassette player/recorderâ-are within the financial means of most Indonesians, including the peasant class. As cassettes and cassette players have penetrated the remotest villages in Indonesia, they have also become part of the vernacular. For example, in addition to the older word ngrekam (\"to record\"), contemporary Javanese now includes words for the process of recording onto a commercial cassette: \"Gendhing kuwi wis dikasetkz\" (\"That piece has already been recorded on commercial cassette.\"). Much of what is available can be classified as \"popular\" music,\" including pop Berat (Western pop) and pop Indonesia (Indonesian pop). Also in abundance is pop Daerah, or regional pop, which is found all across Indonesia. Virtually all genres of pop Daerah are dependent on the cassette medium for their audience. Some Pop Daerah genres are little more than cassette-company experiments, generating only a few performers and a handful of tapes, but others are firmly established, with many performers and steady production. Four genresâ-Pop Batak, Pop Minang, Pop Sunda, and Pop Jawaâ-are especially solid. In the case of these four, some of the production comes out of Jakarta, relying upon Jakarta-based musicians and Jakarta facilities for recording, printing and distribution. However, most of the other regional genres are produced in their home regions (or in the nearby big cities). As a result, the cassette industry is national, regional, and local in character. The broad marketing of cassettes has not led to a musical homogenization or a weakening of regional styles. Rather, local cassette industries have promoted regional styles because, rather than being large national corporations, they are regional \"backyard\" enterprises that record, dub, and market local music primarily for local consumption. Commercial cassettes have also shaped the reputations of popular music performers, significantly raising the prestige and earning power of some recording artists while lowering them for others. Scholars have noted a trend towards the equalization of status for genres and marginal traditions through the distribution of cassettes; the cassette industry is said to act as a leveler, blurring the older status distinctions that were still in place a generation ago.\n\nParagraph 18: The outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 disrupted mail service along the Butterfield Overland Mail's southern stagecoach route from St. Louis, Missouri via El Paso, Fort Yuma and Los Angeles and on to San Francisco via the Tejon Pass, which had begun its run in 1858. To compensate, the government contracted the Butterfield Company to carry mail between Los Angeles and San Francisco via the new wagon road over the Santa Susana Pass. The first overland mail stage run through the pass took place on April 6, 1861. The main route climbs through what is now Santa Susana Pass State Historic Park, with a branch in L.A. City Park 'Chatsworth Park South.' It was an important artery linking the Los Angeles Basin and inland Ventura County, and was part of the main route for travel by stagecoach between Los Angeles and San Francisco from 1861 until the opening of rail traffic between the cities in 1876. The Old Santa Susana Stage Road is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Part of the stage road is also a Historic-Cultural Monument of Ventura County and of the City of Los Angeles under the name 'Old Stagecoach Trail.'\n\nParagraph 19: Southwold has had a harbour since at least Saxon times, but its importance as a port began to decline during the 19th century. In an attempt to reverse the declining fortunes of the town, the Corporation promoted it as a holiday resort, where bathing in private was available on the wide beaches. They expected the East Suffolk Railway from  to  to pass through the town, but it was built further inland, due in part to the underlying geology of the area. Although there was a horse bus service which ran to  station once a day, this was not ideal, and a request was made to the railway company for a branch line to Southwold from Halesworth in 1855. The East Suffolk Railway were not prepared to build one, and several similar schemes were proposed over the next 20 years. The Southwold and Halesworth Tramway obtained an Act of Parliament in 1872, with the intention of building a steam tramway between the two towns, using the provisions of the Tramways Act 1870, but they failed to raise sufficient funds, and the project foundered. Still there were calls for a railway, and in October 1875 two public meetings were held. Mr Charles Easton of Easton Hall chaired one in Halesworth, and the Earl of Stradbroke, who lived at Henham Hall, chaired the other in Southwold. Both were local landowners, and they invited a civil engineer called Arthur C. Pain to speak, together with Richard C. Rapier, who was part of the engineering firm of Ransomes & Rapier. Both speakers suggested that a  gauge railway would be considerably cheaper to build than a standard gauge one, and the meetings resulted in the formation of the Southwold Railway Company. Colonel Heneage Bagot-Chester was appointed as chairman, the two speakers became engineers, and the secretary was a local solicitor called H R Allen.\n\nParagraph 20: The Northern Branch is a railroad line that runs from Jersey City to Northvale in northeastern New Jersey, and formerly extended further into New York State. The line was constructed in 1859 by the Northern Railroad of New Jersey to connect the New York and Erie Railroad's Piermont Branch terminus in Piermont, New York, directly to Erie's primary terminal in Jersey City, initially Exchange Place, later Pavonia Terminal. In 1870 the line was extended to Nyack, New York, and continued to provide passenger service until 1966. After the Erie's unsuccessful merger with the Lackawanna Railroad to form the Erie-Lackawanna, ownership of the line passed into the hands of Conrail upon its formation in 1976 from a number of bankrupt railroads (including the E-L).\n\nParagraph 21: Detection of pathogens using ELISA relies on the interaction between the antigen and specific antibodies and has become a popular and cost-effective means of routine detection. In an ELISA the solid phase can be coated with the sample of interest containing the antigen. The efficiency to which the antigen binds to the solid phase is dependent on temperature, length of exposure as well as concentration. Solid phases used include nitrocellulose membranes, paper, glass, agarose and polystyrene or polyvinylchloride microtiter plates. Microtiter plates are the most widely used solid phase because they are easy to handle, allow for automation and for analysis using microtiter plate readers. A drawback of these plates is that they are highly absorptive and this increases the incidence of non-specific binding of components used in the ELISA. Non-specific binding to the plates is reduced through the use of buffers containing proteins such as casein and non-ionic detergents such as Tween 20. After coating, excess sample is removed and the plate typically treated with a 1% casein containing solution. Subsequent to this the solid phase is treated with antibodies raised against the antigen of interest. After each incubation step the plate is washed with Tween 20 containing PBS. These washing steps are aimed to wash away any non-specifically bound components. Nonspecifically bound components are less strongly bound than the specific bound ones. Detection is achieved either through the addition of an enzyme-coupled antibody or the addition and detection of a biotinylated antibody. In a system using an enzyme-coupled antibody the subsequent addition of an appropriate substrate results in the formation of a colour proportional to the amount of antigen. Alternatively the plate can be coated with antibody followed by incubation with the sample that is to be detected. This, in turn, can be detected as described above and is then referred to as the double antibody sandwich (DAS) ELISA. Both of these systems, however, have a disadvantage in that coupling of the enzyme to the antibody may result in steric hindrance which in turn may result in a loss in function of the antibody and/or the enzyme. This may be overcome through the use of a biotin-avidin or biotin-streptavidin bridge. In this type of system biotin is coupled to the antibody. The biotin molecule has no influence on the working of the antibodies and is easily detectedusing avidin or streptavidin conjugated to a suitable enzyme. Streptavidin has an extremely high affinity for biotin which results in even a higher degree of specificity than a system in which the enzyme is coupled directly the antigen. To establish whether or not the antigen is present, a substrate specific for the enzyme used is added. The enzyme then converts the substrate to a coloured product and the colour intensity can be correlated to the amount of antibodies bound and thus the amount of antigen present. A DAS-ELISA has the advantage that it can increase the specificity of the ELISA and reduce the occurrence of non-specific binding. As a result, the DAS-ELISA principle is commonly employed in ELISAâs for the detection of plant pathogens in plant sap without prior purification of the pathogen.\n\nParagraph 22: Returning to the U.S. from Europe, he worked his way up in the food-publishing business in New York City, New York, as a contributor to Gourmet magazine and a food-product publicist, finally becoming the food editor of The New York Times in 1957. Claiborne was the first man to supervise the food page at a major American newspaper and is credited with broadening The New York Times'''s coverage of new restaurants and innovative chefs. A typical food section of a newspaper in the 1950s was largely targeted to a female readership and limited to columns on entertaining and cooking for the upscale homemaker. Claiborne brought his knowledge of cuisine and own passion for food to the pages, transforming it into an important cultural and social bellwether for New York City and the nation at large.\n\nParagraph 23: The idea to create a children's hospital was born in the 1970s. At this time the BiaÅystok Voivodeship had the lowest rate of hospital beds per 1,000 children as well as lack of academic pediatrics. At that time, the name \"clinical pediatrics center of BiaÅystok\"  was used. Efforts to start the investment were started by prof. Maria Rudobielska (head of the Institute of Pediatrics at the Medical University of Bialystok at that time). It involved the then city and voivodeship authorities, university authorities (Rector Konstanty WiÅniewski) and others. As a result, on November 1, 1974, the Social Committee for the Construction of the Provincial Child Health Center in BiaÅystok was established. Its main purpose was to collect social cash and work towards starting construction. The university also began to distribute donations among public institutions and organizations. During the year, PLN 6.5 million was collected from donations. In 1975, technical documentation was prepared and the location of the investment was determined. The construction works were to start in 1976, but the economic crisis in the country caused the investment to be removed from the investment plan of the Ministry of Health three times. The situation was not made easier by the fact that the university - also due to this crisis - had problems with completing the construction of the Collegium Pathologicum building at 13 Waszyngtona street. The cornerstone for the construction of the Institute of Paediatrics was finally laid during the inauguration of the academic year in 1981. While construction was planned to be completed within 3.5 years the target failed due to economic hardships in  Poland in the early 1980s and temporarily stopped. The breakthrough in the implementation of the investment happened in 1987-1990. On December 1, 1987, at the request of the then Rector of the Medical University of Bialystok, prof. Zbigniew Puchalski, the minister of health Janusz Komender appointed prof. Maciej Kaczmarski to the position of hospital director. The first stage of construction was completed on October 1, 1988. During the inauguration of the academic year 1988-1989, the Children's and Youth Outpatient Clinic was opened. Order of the Minister of Health, Izabela PÅaneta-MaÅecka, signed on December 22, 1988 formally established the University Children Clinical Hospital. The second stage of the investment implementation was performed by prof. Jan GÃ³rski. Buildings which were included in the original plan and were removed due to economic constrains were re-included and built (among them the Collegium Novum building at 15a Waszyngtona Street). Finally, in 2003, after 23 years of construction, the entire investment was officially completed. The last symbolic act was the opening of the Observation and Infection Clinic. In June 2021 an agreement was signed between the hospital and Minister of Health Adam Niedzielski on a general reconstruction of the hospital with a budget of 36 million zlotych with works due to finish by June 2023. In October 2022 the Psychiatric Center was opened, co-financed by the Podlaskie Voivodeship Marshal's Office and the central Polish government, and house a new day-hospitalization department for psychiatric care. The Center was constructed at 2 WoÅodyjowskiego Street, in the place of the former so-called the \"Swedish House\", which was once the seat of the hospital administration and demolished in 2017.\n\nParagraph 24: Sundari (Devika) a tribal beauty captured by Kalinga Bhupati Kamavardhanudu (Rajanala) when he tries to molest her, she kills him and escapes. The soldiers follow her and she was saved by a Prince, Jayachandra (N. T. Rama Rao). Jayachandra loves her at first sight, but he learns that she hates Kings. So, he acts as an ordinary soldier, takes her to the fort where he reforms her as a wise woman and marries her with the permission of his parents (Mukkamala & S. Varalakshmi). Meanwhile, Vahini (Vijaya Nirmala), a heavenly dancer arrives at earth who sees Jayachandra, falls for him and takes away. At earth, the King, Queen and Sundari are worried about the Prince's disappearance. In heaven, Jayachandra did not yield to the love of Vahini. After some time, he requests her to meet his wife for a night. So, she brings Sundari to heaven where both of them unknowingly drink the divine drink nectar Amurtham and sleep, when she awakes, she is back in the palace. Nobody believes her acquaintance with Jayachandra when she becomes pregnant and the King gives her the death sentence. Due to the nectar, she became immortal, as a result, soldiers could not kill and leave her in the forest where tribal people gives her shelter. After that, she gives birth to a baby boy and gives him away to King Udayarka (Dhulipala). Mohini (L. Vijayalakshmi) sister of Vahini also attracted towards Jayachandra. She sprays a medicine on him, by which Jayachandra forgets his past. After facing so many troubles, Sundari lands at a brothel house. Twenty years roll by, due to immortality, Sundari did not lose her beauty, but she protects her chastity and her child Balarka (Nagaraju) also grows up. Once he rescues Sundari and she recognizes him as his son. Balarka inquires about her and goes to meet her where he listens to the conversation of a cow & calf that a person in lust cannot recognize the relationships. Now Sundari could not face her son and jumps into the fire, but she was protected by a cowherd couple. In heaven, Jayachandra gets rid of Vahini & Mohini and returns. After reaching the earth, Jayachandra reveals the entire facts to his parents when they reply, Sundari has been sentenced but he remembers that she is immortal. At present, he is in search of her. Parallelly, Balarka finds out Sundari as his mother, so, he too goes moves. Finally, all of them meet in the forest and the movie ends on a happy note with the reunion of the family.\n\nParagraph 25: The Catholic Encyclopedia (1907â14) writes: \"The view that Bethulia is merely a symbolic name for Jerusalem or a fictitious town, has met with little favor, even among those who deny the historical character of the book. Bethulia is clearly distinguished from Jerusalem (; the references throughout the article being to the fuller Greek text), and the topographical details\" show that \"the story, even if it be only a pious romance, is connected with a definite place. Its site, however, is in dispute. Beside Sanur, MithilÃ®yeh or MisilÃ®yeh, Tell Kheibar and Beit-Ilfa, which have divided opinion for some time, Haraiq el-Mallah, Khirbet Sheikh Shibel, el-BÃ¢rid and Sichem (Bethulia being considered a pseudonym) have [as of the beginning of the 20th century] recently been proposed as sites of Bethulia.\" However, The Jewish Encyclopedia (1901â1906) considers \"fort SÃ¢nÃ»r\", GuÃ©rin's choice for Bethulia, to be too far south, which applies to a smaller degree also to MithilÃ®yeh (Misilyah), the only candidate with a name even slightly similar to that of the biblical town. The Catholic Encyclopedia further writes: \"The city was situated on a mountain overlooking the plain of Jezrael, or Esdrelon, and commanding narrow passes to the south (); at the foot of the mountain there was an important spring, and other springs were in the neighborhood (). Moreover it lay within investing lines which ran through Dothain, or Dothan, now Tell DothÃ¢n, to Belthem, or Belma, no doubt the same as the Belamon of , and thence to Kyamon, or Chelmon, \"which lies over against Esdrelon\" (). These data point to a site on the heights west of Jenin (Engannim), between the plains of Esdrelon and Dothan, where Haraiq, Kh. Sheikh Shibel, and el-BÃ¢rid lie close together. Such a site best fulfills all requirements. It lies between lines drawn from Tell DothÃ¢n to BelÊ½ema, probably Belma, or Belamon, and from the latter to el-YÃ¢mÃ»n, probably Kyamon; there are a number of springs and wells in the neighborhood, and nearby are the two passes of Kefr AdÃ¢n and BurqÃ®n, so narrow in places that two horsemen cannot ride abreast. One of the three above-named places is in all probability the site of ancient Bethulia. The other sites are all deficient in some essential requirement.\" The Jewish Encyclopedia also finds el-BÃ¢rid, a place west of Jenin, as a quite plausible candidate on topographical grounds.\n\nParagraph 26: In B-Pit, as Kenta, Benkei and Yu enters the shop, they found Masamune go back home, suffering an injury while brought a wounded Ryutaro. Masamune tells them that Sol Blaze is stronger than the group thought, and collapses before he can reach Kenta and the others. Ginga, enraged by this, is about to storm off to fight Helios, but Masamune tells him only the water symbol can beat Sol Blaze. From the WBBA headquarters, Ryo tells Gingka that Sol Blaze is the Orihalcon bey that destroyed Atlantis in the first place. Then, Ginga begins the trip to stop Sol Blaze, joined by Benkei, Masamune, Kenta, Madoka and Yu. They arrive in there by riding a helicopter. Then, Gingka convinces Helios to stop the rise of Atlantis, but Helios declines. Gingka tells him that Sol Blaze is the dangerous Orihalcon bey and Helios was convinced at first, but Bakin makes him declines once more. Then, Bakin commands Helios to crush them. Ginga was enraged a little, but Masamune says whatever you say, it will be useless. Then Masamune recklessly launches Ray Striker, but Helios defeats him with ease. Even he continues to attack Ray Striker. In order to stop Helios from attacking Ray Striker, Benkei, Kenta and Yu launch their beys. This doesn't help much as Helios uses his special move, Blaze Execution, thus almost burning Dark Bull, Flame Sagittario, Flame Libra and Ray Striker. Kenta begs Helios to stop. Then they were saved by Ginga who challenges Helios to a battle. Helios and Gingka start the battle. Gingka is seen stronger than before. Both bladers use their full power and command their special moves. Gingka uses his special move Galaxy Nova to defeat Sol Blaze. Helios is disappointed but Bakin tells him that he did  very well. Bakin says that he only needed Pegasus and Blaze to battle with their full power and the result didn't matter. Then Bakin explains his complete plan. His plan was to use Pegasus and Blaze's power to drop Adonis on earth which would destroy all civilizations on earth. Then he would rebuild Atlantis on it. Everyone including Helios was surprised to hear Bakin's plans. Helios is completely stunned to understand that what he believed throughout his life was not true. Gingka and co. tried to stop Helios' grandfather but they get surrounded by Bakin's bladers. Helios decides to stop his grandfather's evil intentions. He uses Sol Blaze to take out Bakin's bladers. Gingka and Helios respectively launch Galaxy Pegasus and Sol Blaze to fight against Bakin's bey Dark Poseidon. While Dark Poseidon was fighting against Galaxy Pegasus and Sol Blaze, Kyoya's Rock Leone appear out of nowhere. Kyoya tells Gingka and Helios to go to space and destroy Adonis. Kyoya's Rock Leone defeats Dark Poseidon. Meanwhile, Gingka and Helios takes a rocket to space. With the power of Pegasus and Blaze, Gingka and Helios destroys Adonis and save the earth.\n\nParagraph 27: In the autumn of 1943 the design bureau of the Stalin Ural Tank Factory No. 183, located in Nizhny Tagil (in the Ural Mountains, where most of the Soviet tank industry had been evacuated after Operation Barbarossa in 1941), started working on a vehicle that would have improvement opportunities in the future, under a direct order from Joseph Stalin. The intention was to retain the high mobility of the T-34 and provide it with heavier armour protection against modern tank guns. In November 1943, the chief designer, A. A. Morozov, presented the overall design of the vehicle and a model of the tank, which received the designation T-44 (Ob'yekt 136). The first prototype was completed by January 1944 and two more were completed in February. The first two prototypes were armed with 85mm D-5T guns and received the designation T-44-85, while the third prototype was armed with the 122mm D-25-44T tank gun and received the designation T-44-122. The D-25-44T tank gun was very similar to the basic D-25 field gun, but differed in some minor details including fixed single-piece ammunition to increase the rate of fire and a double-baffle muzzle brake. What allowed fitting such powerful armament in a medium tank weighing 30 tonnes was the construction of the hull with an innovative placement of the engine. Unlike most tanks, in the T-44 the engine was placed perpendicular to the axis of the tank. The hull was designed without sponsons. It was also much wider which made the crew compartment bigger and allowed the turret to be placed over the center part of the vehicle. This reduced the overall length of the vehicle. The thickness of the armour was 75mm on the front of the hull and 90mm on the front of the turret. The side armour was 45Â mm thick and could be reinforced by 30Â mm thick additional armour plate. All three prototypes were powered by the V-2IS diesel engine which developed 500Â hp (373Â kW). This first generation of prototypes featured a raised cast driver's hatch with an opening vision flap as well as mounting bolts in a ring around the base of the gun tube.\n\nParagraph 28: stated by the Church Committee to renovate the building. Approval was accorded by the then Chief Electrical Engineer, Janab M.Hayath, during his visit to Jog in the month of November 1948, for renovating the building, as it was required by rules. An appeal for funds, approved by His Lordship the Bishop of Mysore, was sent up all round. The Catholic workers of Jog, though poor, readily responded to the appeal by contributing their mite both by cash and free labour. The mound all around the Chapel was levelled by the voluntary labour of the Catholics, the cost of which was then estimated to about Rs. 1500/-. Then the mud walled Chapel was dismantled and the foundation for the Church was laid by His Lordship on 2 June 1948. The construction of the Church was entrusted to Government Contractor Sriyuths V. Lakkanna and Krishna lyengar, who did the work on most economic and concessional rates, and the work was completed by the end of 1949. During the construction of the Church, Mass was being said in Mr. D'Sa's Bungalow. The total cost of the building excluding free labour (free labour was estimated at about Rs. 2000/-) was about Rs.2500/- In the efforts were continued for collecting funds, both for the construction and maintenance of the Church. and Mr. & Mrs. DâSa along with the Committee members, paid personal interest in collecting funds both from and outside Jog. Mr. DâSa took keen interest in collecting funds even from Mangalore and other places, Mr. J.L.DâSa was in direct management of Church affairs, as the President of the Catholic Association, from the year 1945 to 1955 November, when he was transferred to Bangalore on promotion as the Chief Electrical Engineer. The Catholics of Jog gave grand party to D'Sa family, on the eve of the Parish Feast on 7 November 1955. The distinguished guests who graced the occasion were, Sri H.V.Narayana Rao, General Superintendent Jog (Presided),Rev. Father Aug F D'Souza, Parish Priest, Sagar, Father Joseph DâSouza, Parish Priest, Shimoga, Father AFernandes, Parish Priest, Hosanagar. A beautiful Picture of Christ the King, mounted in pure silver frame Was presented to D'Sa family, as token of love and gratitude from the Catholics of Jog. A farewell address both in English and Kannada was read on the occasion, at which Mr. D'Sa was requested to continue his patronage over the Catholic Community of Jog, by continuing to be the President (in absentia) of the Association. The following are some of the important works carried out by the Church Committee, during the direct management of Mr.D'Sa:\n\nParagraph 29: In the fall of 2009 the Institute of Medicine recommended updates and revisions to the school lunch and breakfast programs, at the request of U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The committee reviewed the current regulations for the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program Nutrition Standards and Meal Requirements. The planning model used to develop current nutritional standards and related meal requirements is based on legislation (USDA,1995) that provided specifications for use of 1995 Dietary Guidelines for American and the 1989 Recommended Dietary Allowances (NRC, 1989). To meet its task, the IOM committee also reviewed and assessed the food and nutritional needs of school-aged children in the United States using the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans set by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and USDA, as well as the IOMâs Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI). The committee recommends numerous revisions and that emphasis be placed on revised Meal Requirements rather than on nutrients per se. The committeeâs recommended new approach clearly focuses on providing meals that are consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The final report, School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children was released in November 2009.  The committee recommended that the USDA adopt standards for menu planning, including:\n\nParagraph 30: Traditionally, commands would be passed from the senior officer on the bridge to stations dispersed throughout the ship, where physical control of the ship was exercised, as technology did not exist for the remote control of steering or machinery. Helm orders would be passed to an enclosed wheel house, where the coxswain or helmsman operated the ship's wheel. Engine commands would be relayed to the engine officer in the engine room by an engine order telegraph that displayed the captain's orders on a dial. The engine officer would ensure that the correct combination of steam pressure and engine revolutions were applied. Weatherproof pilot houses supplanted open bridges so that the pilot, who was traditionally the ship's navigating officer, could issue commands from shelter.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nThe Church Committee renovated a building in Jog with the approval of the Chief Electrical Engineer in November 1948. Funds were raised through an appeal approved by the Bishop of Mysore, and the Catholic workers of Jog contributed both money and labor. The mound around the chapel was leveled by voluntary labor, and the mud-walled chapel was dismantled to make way for the construction of the church. The construction was completed by the end of 1949, with the total cost estimated to be about Rs.2500/-. Efforts to collect funds continued for both construction and maintenance of the church, with Mr. DâSa and the committee members taking an active role in fundraising. Mr. J.L. DâSa managed the church affairs as the President of the Catholic Association until his transfer to Bangalore in November 1955. On the eve of the parish feast in November 1955, a party was thrown to honor the DâSa family, and a silver-framed picture of Christ the King was presented as a token of gratitude. Mr. DâSa was asked to continue supporting the Catholic Community of Jog as the association's president, albeit in absentia. The church committee carried out various important works under Mr. DâSa's management.\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from.

{"group": "Passage Retrieval", "dataset": "passage_retrieval_en", "article": "Here are 30 paragraphs from Wikipedia, along with an abstract. Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: There is little written information about the people of GÄ§argÄ§ur in earlier days. One source of information is the Dejma list, which mentions GÄ§argÄ§ur in conjunction with Ä¦al Samudi (Madliena). In the Middle Ages, GÄ§argÄ§ur was most probably a very small rural community. An abbey was established in Ä¦al GÄ§argÄ§ur in the Middle Ages, in an area now called Tar-RÄ§ieb (Friars' (old Maltese) place). There is no evidence as to when and why this abbey was abandoned, but the reason could have been the constant pirate attacks on the village, which led to a severe depopulation of both GÄ§argÄ§ur and nearby settlements. During these raids, settlements were looted and those considered valuable enough were taken into slavery. Indeed, in this period houses in GÄ§argÄ§ur were built so as to allow the residents to lock themselves in. One feature of these houses was a secret room in which females used to hide during these attacks. Also, the old streets and alleys are planned in a way that would confuse visitors. These raids continued well into the years, even after GÄ§argÄ§ur became a parish. Indeed, on one occasion the residents of GÄ§argÄ§ur found refuge in the parish church and vowed that if they were unharmed, there would be an annual pilgrimage to the shrine of [MellieÄ§a]. Nobody was harmed or taken into slavery on that occasion, and thus the tradition of holding this pilgrimage was started.\n\nParagraph 2: Hundreds of holiday tourists on the Phi Phi Islands were washed out to sea. Tuk-tuk drivers were quick to offer assistance, driving victims to hospitals, higher grounds and away from the surging waters. The nearby Ko Lanta Yai, however, was not afflicted as badly. At some places in Phuket and Phang Nga provinces, elephants were used to move and lift heavy wreckage to search for victims and to clear roads. These included six male Indian elephants which had previously been used in making the movie Alexander. On a beach in Thailand, a man was leading an elephant to entertain tourists, when the tsunami came. The elephant's natural instinct to flee the sea saved the life of a young girl who was upon his back.\n\nParagraph 3: Jamal's sexuality is a point of contention very early on for him and his father, while his mother sees the signs and loves him anyway. Lee Daniels made a conscious effort to remove the \"stereotype\" from Jamal's sexuality. \"Look... there are all different types of gay people\" Daniels remarked. Smollett said the show is \"not shoving anything down your throat. It's not preaching, it's not telling you the way you should feel about a certain issue, but it is giving you options. Lee [Daniels] holds up the mirror to us as human beings.\" Thanks to his own experience as a gay man, Daniels is able to construct the world of Empire around Jamal who is written as a \"down-the-middle, well-mannered, even-keeled, guy-next-door type\". Daniels wanted to \"normalize\" gay romances, specifically between men of color. Show runner Ilene Chaiken said \"We're going to go places with Jamal that are unexpected and that you've never seen a television show go â certainly not on a broadcast television show â with a gay black character... Maybe not with any gay character, frankly.\" Daniels said \"Homophobia is rampant in the African-American community\" and using the character of Jamal, \"I wanted to blow the lid off it.\" \"We are behind closed doors in a family situation and trying to tell it as honestly as possible. The things my father said to me because of homophobia frightened the devil out of me.\" said Terrence Howard. He continued, \"What we're really trying to do... is give people an opportunity to see what they're doing is painful. It's crushing someone that could be beautiful.\" The scene in which Lucious throws a 4-year-old Jamal into a trash can after Jamal dresses up in Cookie's heels comes from actual events from Daniels own childhood. While Jamal's sexuality is known in his personal life, Ilene Chaiken explained that Jamal is \"coming out to the world which not everybody gets\". However, it would be very difficult for Jamal not only as an artist, but also as the son of someone with such fame. In addition, Jamal is black and he is a part of the hip-hop community. This is a \"very, very big deal and it's a huge story to tell\" Chaiken said. However, Jamal wants to come out on his own terms, and that causes some trouble for him. According to Smollett, Jamal changes his mind about coming out in episode 102, \"The Outspoken King\" because \"It just wasn't the right time for him, especially to do it in such a grand way â with the press conference and the performance. That was a show! That's not Jamal.\"\n\nParagraph 4: In addition to the army wagons, some 75 additional civilian wagons belonging to cotton speculators followed along behind.  General Steele had strongly instructed Lieutenant-Colonel Drake not to attempt a crossing of the Moro Bayou bottomâa few miles west of Marks Millsâafter nightfall.  According to Captain Samuel Swiggett of the 36th Iowa, as the supply train approached the bottom on Sunday afternoon, Drake was confronted with a nearly impassible road through the bottom due to flooding caused by recent heavy spring rainfall.  Additionally, according to Swiggett, the civilian teamsters tagging along behind were growing argumentative and hard to handle due to the slow pace.  Drake therefore ordered the train into encampment in a field on the side of the road west of Moro crossing at 2 pm, and meanwhile ordered several dozen Black contrabands accompanying the train forward as pioneers to begin cutting down timber and laying a corduroy road across the muddy bottom.  Others, including members of the 43rd Indiana, stated later that the train went into camp closer to 4pm. Regardless of the precise time, it is likelyâas Swiggett pointed outâthat the entire train could have crossed the Moro Bottom by evening. Union General Powell Clayton, in command at Pine Bluff, knew that Steele would be sending more wagons to Pine Bluff for additional supplies and he had posted some of his troops at Mount Elba, halfway between Marks Mills and Pine Bluff, to provide escort for any federal trains enroute Pine Bluff. It is Swiggett's contention, therefore, that had Drake pressed on that Sunday afternoon, the train would have successfully crossed Moro bottom and could have been well on its way up the Pine Bluff Road to Mount Elba by nightfall. Swiggett reported that as they lay in camp on the west bank of the Moro, all experienced a feeling or foreboding.  Swiggett's opinion is supported by the fact that the Confederate forces had crossed the Ouachita River well below Camden and made an all-night forced march of 52 miles on 24 April in order to get in front of Drake's command, and consequently the Confederates had just barely arrived at the ambush site in force early Monday morning and they were still sorting out their ambush plan when Drake's command crossed the Moro and continued up the road into the clearing at Marks Mills. Thus, had Drake pressed forward on Sunday instead of going into camp in mid-afternoon, it is very possible that the train would have been well ahead of the ambush site by 8:00 am on Monday morning and within range of Clayton's cavalry escort posted at Mount Elba.\n\nParagraph 5: In recent times, Eurostat publishes the \"business investment rate\" (also called the \"gross investment rate of non-financial corporations\") in its quarterly sector accounts for the EU27. This ratio is defined as gross fixed capital formation divided by gross value added, in other words the share of GFCF in gross product. It provides an indication of how much of the total factor income is reinvested in new fixed assets. Normally that ratio is about 20â23% of gross value-added. However, calling it the \"business investment rate\" or the \"gross investment rate\" is somewhat deceptive, since this indicator refers only to fixed investment, and more specifically, the net fixed investment (fixed assets bought, less disposals of fixed assets). The actual total funds which are spent by enterprises on investments, in gross terms, are much larger, both because enterprises invest in far more than fixed assets only (they also buy intermediate goods and services, and some financial assets), and because the total money they spend on buying fixed assets is larger than the same sum netted of asset disposals. The main reason why this Eurostat indicator is published is that it shows something about the longer-term expectations of enterprises. If business confidence is low, enterprises are less likely to tie up new earnings in additional fixed assets, which are usually held for a number of years. If, on the other hand, business confidence is buoyant, it is more likely that enterprises will spend more of their current earnings on longer-term investments in fixed assets. In turn, the rate at which enterprises invest earnings in longer-term assets is an indicator of business expansion â if the rate declines, then this typically lowers the rate of cumulative business expansion. For example, in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the ratio dropped to slightly below 20% in Q1 2010 from a high of 23% in Q2 2008. Although this 3% drop in the ratio may not seem so large, in reality it signifies a very large amount of money that was no longer spent. The reason is that the total gross investment and gross value-added for the European Union amount to trillions of euro's, while the total gross value-added also fell significantly in 2008-2010.\n\nParagraph 6: When bowling, Trumble made the most of his height, bringing the ball over the full extent of his right arm. His action was described by his team-mate and bowling partner, Monty Noble, as \"sidelong and insinuating, with his neck craned like a gigantic bird\". He bowled off spinners with an impeccable length at medium pace and was able to swing the new ball. He had a well-disguised slower ball, hoodwinking batsmen such as Stanley Jackson, who said, \"You old devil. You get me caught-and-bowled whenever you like but I'll pick that slow one sooner or later.\" He preferred English pitches, saying he hardly saw one on which he could not get some turn and the temperate weather allowed him to bowl all day. In Australia, Trumble had to work harder for his wickets on firmer pitches, relying on his change of pace and consistent accuracy; he claimed he could land the ball on a saucer  away five times out of six. Johnnie Moyes named him as an \"immortal of the art\" who succeeded by \"attacking the batsman's strength\". W. G. Grace called him \"the best bowler Australia has sent us\". While Trumble was able to score 1,183Â runs during the 1899 tour of England, the demands of bowling did not allow him to consistently score heavily. His long, prehensile fingers helped him make a reputation as a fine slips fieldsman and he was the first to take 20Â catches in an Australian season. English cricketer Johnny Douglas said, \"Trumble should not be allowed on the cricket fieldâhis natural place would be up trees in the bush.\" He practised slip fielding by catching a tennis ball thrown against a brick wall; he believed this practise trained him not to \"snatch\" at the ball but allow it to fall into his safe hands.\n\nParagraph 7: Operations against al-Qaeda linked terrorists continued in 2009 when on 14 September several U.S. Navy helicopters launched a raid in Baraawe against Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, killing him as well as five other militants. Also in 2009, Operators from the SAS and the SRR were deployed to Djibouti as part of Combined Joint Task Force â Horn of Africa to conducting operations against Islamist terrorists in Somalia; carrying out missions focusing on surveillance and targeting of terrorists, alongside their US counterparts, they have also been carrying out this role in Yemen. On 25 January 2012, two U.S. Navy SEAL teams raided a compound  north of Adow, Somalia, freeing two hostages while killing nine pirates and capturing five others. On 5 October 2013, American commandos from DEVGRU launched an amphibious raid on the town of Baraawe engaging with al-Shabaab militants and inflicting some casualties on them before withdrawing. On 5 March 2016, U.S. airstrikes carried out by aircraft and unmanned drones killed more than 150 Al-Shabaab terrorists at a terrorist training camp called \"Camp Raso\", located about 120 miles north of Mogadishu as they were completing \"training for a large-scale attack\" according to a Pentagon spokesman. The camp had been under surveillance for some time before the strike. In the early hours of 9 March 2016, U.S. special forces and Somali national army special forces killed between 1 and 15 Al-Shabaab terrorists in a heliborne-attack on the Al-Shabaab-controlled town of Awdhegele, as well as capturing an undisclosed number of high-value Al-Shabaab figures the militants were training for a major operation against coalition forces. On 11/12 April 2016, two U.S. airstrikes on Al-Shabaab targets in the town of Kismayo killed about a dozen suspected militants who posed an \"imminent threat\" to American troops in the country. As of May 2016, roughly 50 U.S. special operations troops operate at undisclosed locations across southern Somalia, with their headquarters at the airport in Mogadishu; advising and assisting, Kenyan, Somali and Ugandan forces in their fight against Al-Shabaab. Also in that month, U.S. personnel helped those forces plan an operation against illegal checkpoints. On 13 May, a U.S. strike targeted nine al-Shabab militants, three of them were allegedly killed. On 1 June 2016, the Pentagon announced that it had conducted an airstrike that killed a senior Al-Shabaab leader in Somalia on 27 May. On 3 August 2016, a contingent of elite American troops acting as military advisers assisted Somali commandos in an assault on an al-Shabaab checkpoint in Saakow, as the Somali-led force approached the checkpoint the militants opened fire, a gun battle ensued that resulted in 3 militants killed. On 29 September 2016, the Military Times reported that on 26 September a bomb-manufacturing network linked al-Shabaab attacked a small team of U.S. and Somali troops, who were conducting an operation near Kismayo, with small-arms fire. A Pentagon spokesman said the U.S. military \"conducted a self-defense strike to neutralize the threat and in doing so killed nine enemy fighters.\" Also on 28 September, near the town of Galkayo, a Somali army unit conducting counterterrorism operations nearby, when the Somali soldiers came under fire from al-Shabab militants. The Somali soldiers engaged them, then broke contact and rejoined with their nearby American advisers and soon afterwards the militants \"began to maneuver in an offensive manner\" so the U.S. conducted a self-defense airstrike, killing 4 militants.\n\nParagraph 8: In 1907, Thomas W. Lawson was under charter to the Anglo-American Oil Company (part of Standard Oil) and set sail on November 19 from the piers of Marcus Hook Refinery (20 miles south of Philadelphia) to London with 58,000 barrels of light paraffin oil. Two days before leaving, the new captain, George Washington Dow, had to hire six new men to the crew because six other seamen had quit their jobs due to payment problems. Those new men weren't able seamen and some didn't speak fluent English. Leaving the mouth of the Delaware River, on November 20, the large schooner set course for England under fair weather conditions. But the following day the weather turned considerably worse. The ship was not sighted for more than 20 days during its first transatlantic journey, which was quite horrible in extremely stormy weather. With the loss of most of her sails, all but one lifeboat, and the breach of hatch no. 6, causing the ship's pumps to clog due to a mixture of intruding seawater and the engine's coal in the ship's hold, the schooner reached the Celtic Sea northwest of the Isles of Scilly. On December 13, entering the English Channel, she mistakenly passed inside the Bishop Rock lighthouse. Her captain anchored between the Nundeeps shallows and Gunner's Rock, northwest of the island of Annet, to ride out an impending gale, refusing several requests of St. Agnes and St. Mary's lifeboat crews to abandon the ship. Captain Dow, trusting in his anchors, only accepted the Trinity House pilot Billy \"Cook\" Hicks from St. Agnes lifeboat, who came aboard at 5 p.m. on Friday 13. Both lifeboats of St. Agnes and St. Mary's had to return to their stations because of an unconscious crewman on the former and a broken mast on the latter. They cabled to Falmouth, Cornwall, for a tug which couldn't put to sea, unable to face the storm.\n\nParagraph 9: Towards the end of the Second World War he served in the Royal Corps of Signals. After a brilliant undergraduate career at Christ Church, Oxford (BA 1947) he studied for ordination at Westcott House, Cambridge. After his first curacy in Edinburgh, he worked for the Student Christian Movement. From 1961 to 1966 he was a member of staff of the World Council of Churches (Executive Secretary for Faith and Order). He returned from Geneva after being nominated (but not elected) as General Secretary of the WCC. In the event the post went to the Revd Eugene Carson Blake. During his service as an Anglican Bishop he was also chair of the Churches' Unity Commission and president of the Conference of European Churches. As Bishop of Oxford he presided over the beginning of an Area scheme which delegated functions from the diocesan to his suffragan or \"Area\" bishops, in order to decentralise the work of the diocese. In retirement he served as an assistant bishop in the Diocese of Edinburgh. In 1989, he published Songs in a Strange Land, a devotional book on praying with the Psalms.\n\nParagraph 10: In 1708 after realizing that Ivan Mazepa sided with Carl XII, Peter the Great order to destroy Baturyn and transfer capital to Hlukhiv. Here in November 1708 was elected a new Hetman of Zaporizhian Host Ivan Skoropadsky, while the Metropolitan of Kyiv, Halych and all Little Russia Ioasaf was forced to proclaim anathema onto Mazepa in the St. Trinity Cathedral (destroyed in 1962). Hlukhiv served as the capital of the Cossack Hetmanate in 1708-64 and until 1773 the administrative center of the Little Russia Governorate. Under the last hetmans of Ukraine, the town was remodeled in the Baroque style. Subsequently, it declined in consequence of frequent fires, so that very few of its architectural gems survived.\n\nParagraph 11: All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins joined the Warriors in 2018â19. While teammates with Curry and Thompson on the 2014 US FIBA Basketball World Cup team, he had joked that he was the third Splash Brother. At the time, he had made nine of his 61 three-point attempts (14.8%) in his four-year career, but had improved to 35.1 percent in the four years since. On October 29, 2018, against the Chicago Bulls, Thompson hit an NBA-record 14 threes to break Curry's former mark of 13.  Thompson scored 52 points in 27 minutes while making 14-for-24 of his threes. His 10 three-pointers in the first half tied Chandler Parsons' record set in 2014, and Golden State made 17 threes in the first half to set the NBA record for a half. With Curry having already scored 51 points in a game earlier in 2018â19, the Splash Brothers became the first NBA teammates to have each scored 50 or more points in a contest through their team's first eight games. In the 2019 playoffs, the Warriors eliminated the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round 4â2, but both Curry and Thompson suffered sprained ankles in Game 6, and they were questionable entering Game 1 of the conference semifinals against Houston. The series was tied 2â2 after four games, and the Splash Brothers were struggling with their 3-point shooting, combining to miss at least two-thirds of their attempts in five straight games, the longest streak in their postseason history. With the two struggling with their shooting, Kevin Durant had been the Warriors best player in the playoffs, averaging a team-leading 35.4 points entering Game 5. However, Durant left the game with 2:05 remaining in the third quarter after suffering a strained right calf; he was later ruled out indefinitely. Curry led the Golden State to a Game 5 win after scoring 16 of his 25 points after Durant exited, while Thompson had seven of his 27 during that stretch. The Warriors captured the series on the road in Game 6, when Thompson scored 21 of his 27 in the first half, and Curry collected all of his 33 points in the second half. Golden State lost 4â2 in the 2019 finals against the Toronto Raptors. Already without Durant, who returned and tore his Achilles in Game 5, the Warriors lost Thompson near the end of the third quarter of the deciding Game 6 after he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee.\n\nParagraph 12: The Tá»± Äá»©c Báº£o Sao or Äá»ng Sao (éé, billets of copper) were introduced by the Ministry of Revenue (æ¸é¨, Há» Bá») in the year Tá»± Äá»©c 14 (1961) for large transactions and taxes on behalf of stores of the government of Äáº¡i Nam, the introduction of the Tá»± Äá»©c Báº£o Sao marked the redefinition of the tiá»n or máº¡ch denominations and the quÃ n (strings of cash coins) where the quÃ n was made equal to 10 máº¡ch and the máº¡ch was made the equivalent of 60 zinc cash coins, under these exchange rates 1 quÃ n was worth a string of 600 zinc cash coins. The Äá»ng Sao series of cash coins was introduced as zinc cash coins were heavy in quantity to carry around for the payment of larger sums of money, to this end the government introduced a system of monetary units determined by their nominal value in zinc cash coins as opposed to their intrinsic market value, it is possible that this might have been inspired by contemporary Chinese coinage of the Xianfeng era in the Qing dynasty where large denomination coins from 4 up to 1000 vÄn circulated alongside each other with little to no difference in intrinsic value in a fiduciary system, this system was also used by the Vietnamese. When the Tá»± Äá»©c Báº£o Sao was first proposed the Mandarins of the imperial court of Äáº¡i Nam suggested to simply increase the weight of the brass Tá»± Äá»©c ThÃ´ng Báº£o to make them worth more relative to the zinc Tá»± Äá»©c ThÃ´ng Báº£o cash coins as 1 brass cash coin with a weight of 9 pháº§n was worth four zinc cash coins. The value of the Äá»ng Sao cash coins was indicated on the reverses of the coins expressed in their worth in zinc cash coins preceded by the character  (chuáº©n, regarded as equal to), despite the fact that Sao (é) means \"paper money\", though imperfectly the denominations of these coins attempted to take the respective value of brass and zinc cash coins into account which means that they can't be fully qualified as a fiat currency. The Ministry of Revenue of Äáº¡i Nam originally set the exchange rate between the brass Tá»± Äá»©c Báº£o Sao and zinc cash coins heavily in favour of the larger denominations which wasn't accepted by the market which resulted in the imperial court attempting to adjust the exchange rate more to the contemporary exchange values of brass and zinc cash coins that were in circulation. In January 1868 by decree the exchange rate between brass 9 pháº§n cash and zinc cash coins was fixed 1:4 replacing the early ratio of 1:2.67 that had been in place since 1858. The Tá»± Äá»©c Báº£o Sao was generally well received by the population of Äáº¡i Nam despite the fact that their circulation was reduced due to their high purchasing power relative to their intrinsic value until their weight was decreased, which was done by the government to conform to the new official exchange between brass and zinc cash coins.\n\nParagraph 13: Daring was en route from the Kiel Canal to Londonderry Port when she was redirected to the Mediterranean. She paused at Gibraltar, and went alongside at Malta. A new crew were flown out from UK in November 1956. To all of the engineering staff she was a completely new design with high pressure four drum boilers and two furnaces operating at 650psi and 850 F superheat. They had a very short period in which to acquaint themselves with the ship and machinery before setting off for the Suez during the Crisis of 1956. On completion of that tour she returned to the Western Mediterranean. She teamed up with three other 'Darings' and carried out exercises with them in the Golfe du Lion. One exercise was a high speed night maneuvering carried out at 30 knots+. Steaming in line abreast under complete blackout the four ships received a signal from Capt. 'D' to turn to starboard 90 degrees into line ahead. Daring was on the end of the line with HMS Diana on her starboard side. When the 'Execute' order was received, Diana failed to respond and Daring turned directly at her. The first lieutenant was on the bridge with the Capt. in the radar plot room. I was i/c 'B' boiler room and saw the repeater telegraph move to \"Full Astern\". This is an order which has to be obeyed immediately regardless of damage to machinery. The safety valves on my boiler lifted within seconds as the engine room responded shutting off steam to the ahead turbine. The pressure rapidly fell then as the astern maneuvering valves were opened, falling to 150psi before beginning to recover. Water in some quantity must have gone with the steam as several rows of the astern turbine were carried away. Fortunately, being the port engine in 'B' Unit, they managed to get the engine into reverse mode somewhat more quickly than the 'A' Unit which pulled the ship round to port very narrowly avoiding the almost inevitable collision.  The ship then made its way to Gibraltar on the one shaft where it spent three months in the dockyard refitting a new astern turbine.\n\nParagraph 14: The Zasuul (literally meaning a \"fixer\") of the wrestler is an on-field guide and coach of the wrestler. In lower round competitions when there are many wrestlers, most wrestlers don't have their own zasuuls. Successful wrestlers and those that get to the higher rounds get their own zasuuls. A Zasuuls' role is to hold the hat of his wrestler while he wrestles and give him encouragement and motivation on the field.  For instance, if the match is going slowly, a zasuul might slap the buttocks of his wrestler to encourage him to engage his opponent faster. Zasuuls are not technically coaches in the literal sense. They are usually an elder and a friend of the wrestler who is there on the field to serve as a guide and help set up a fair competition.  Also, unlike other grappling sports, a Zasuul does not have to be a former wrestler. When the match starts, the wrestlers are divided about  evenly into left and right sides, and sometimes a zasuul will sing a praise of his wrestler to open a challenge from that side in the higher rounds, and the other side's zasuul will also respond with his own praise of his wrestler. The poetic praise of a wrestler by his zasuul comes from the wrestler with the highest rank on that side.\n\nParagraph 15: Although Quintessence played many hundreds of concerts and festivals all over Europe, they turned down a U.S. record deal negotiated by Island Records' Chris Blackwell and did not play at a concert at New York's Carnegie Hall lined up in early 1972, or tour the U.S., because four of the band's members wanted a larger monetary advance. This disappointed Blackwell and he dropped the band from the record label. Quintessence then signed with RCA and recorded one album with Jones and Dev. Raja Ram then unexpectedly 'fired' the pair after that album was released. Jones and Dev went on to form the short-lived outfit called Kala, along with Davey 'Crabsticks' Trotter. Meanwhile, Quintessence played on into the 1980s before breaking up.\n\nParagraph 16: The team was formed in 1985 by brothers Leo and Richard Jackson. At the Daytona 500 that year, the team entered the No. 55 and No. 66 cars, sponsored by U.S. Smokeless Tobacco through its Copenhagen and Skoal brands and driven by another pair of brothers, Benny Parsons and his brother Phil. Benny finished 31st and Phil finished 29th, both suffering engine failure. Phil ran fourteen races with the team that year and posted three top 10s while splitting time with another ride, and Benny ran fourteen races as well and had six top 10 finishes running a limited schedule. The two returned for 1986, when BP had four top tens and won the team's first pole position. Phil ran a limited schedule himself and had five top-tens. After Benny left at the end of the year, his brother moved from the No. 66 to the No. 55. In his first year with the No. 55, Phil Parsons finished a then career-high fourth at Martinsville and finished 14th in points. The No. 66 ran only one race that year, with IndyCar driver Tom Sneva running at Daytona before dropping out with engine failure. In 1988, Parsons improved to a ninth-place finish in points, with the highlight of his year coming with his victory at the Winston 500 despite running out of fuel earlier in the race. In 1989 the team returned to a two-car operation, signing Harry Gant away from Mach 1 Racing with the Skoal sponsorship coming with him. The Jacksons also traded numbers with Mach 1 owner Hal Needham and ran the No. 33 alongside the No. 55. Gant won early in the season at Darlington Speedway and finished seventh in points, while Parsons, despite additional sponsorship from Crown Petroleum, only had three top-tens and dropped to 21st in points. At the end of the year, Parsons left for Morgan-McClure Motorsports.\n\nParagraph 17: The John P. Stevens award-winning theatre company has been an ongoing program in the school for many years now. Since the foundation of the company, several Broadway and off-Broadway shows have been performed; some notable include: Grease, Into the Woods, Pippin, The Wiz, Leader of the Pack and Urinetown: The Musical. The theatre company's production of Urinetown garnered several honorable mentions and nominations by the NJ Paper Mill Playhouse Rising Star Awards. Other productions by the company from the past include Macbeth, The Musical Comedy Murders of 1940, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown and Working among others. The theatre company put on a production of Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee's Inherit the Wind in November 2007. The company put on perhaps their most successful and lauded show ever: the Stephen Sondheim musical Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street in April 2008.  Since then, they have put on The Odyssey, Tommy, The Crucible, and Jekyll & Hyde. In the fall of 2010, the company performed the play, Metamorphoses. In 2011, the company performed the rock opera hit Rent and Our Town. In 2019, their musical was Chicago: The Musical and their Fall Play was A Midsummer Night's Dream. In the fall of 2019, their fall play was Vintage Hitchcock: A Live Radio Play. Their musical for the 2020 school year was The Addams Family, but the production was cut to two show nights due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Likewise, due to the pandemic, the company did not have a formal fall show, but opted to present a series of online one-acts under the title of \"Virtuality.\" In spring 2021, the company's spring musical was The Theory of Relativity, a musical about the importance of relationships and connectivity, teaching lessons that everyone needed to hear amidst a global pandemic. The fall play for the 2021-22 school year was Almost, Maine by John Cariani, and the musical was Mamma Mia!.\n\nParagraph 18: Max apologises to Danny for treated him poorly and says he believes in his diving ability but Danny refuses to let Max train him again. Danny and Shane arrange their own training sessions and Danny enters a local competition, which he wins. Max is not pleased and he later tells Maria coaching was his thing and he is no longer needed. Maria tells Max to move on and says they have more time to be a couple. Max supports Danny when he is wrongly accused of robbing Carol Brown (Merrin Canning) and confronts her about the accusation but later admits he thinks Danny is guilty. He catches Danny sneaking out to meet with his friend Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan) and almost strikes him. The boys run away and Maria feels Max was too hard on Danny, and Max appears not to care if Danny returns home. When Maria asks Max why he does not love Danny as much as Shane, he says he was never sure Danny was his biological son; after demanding the truth from her, Maria tells Max he is not. Maria was afraid to tell Max in case it worsened his relationship with Danny. Max realises Maria became pregnant during a brief separation and tells Jim he never thought she would do that to him. Jim suggests Max speak to Maria but he refuses. Max later tells Maria he will never come to terms with Danny not being his son; he tells Maria their marriage is over and he moves into a bedsit. Max is visited by an old school friend Nick Burman (Vic Hawkins), who says he has feelings for Maria. Nick takes Max to the pub and insists Max drives them home but they are involved in an accident and Max is charged with drink-driving. \n\nParagraph 19: She had a small part in Sullivan's 1977 softcore sex comedy Come Play with Me, alongside Alfie Bass and Irene Handl. Although critically panned, the film was highly successful, running continuously for four years at one London cinema. It then became one of the first British films to sell in large numbers on the new VHS format. This was followed by a larger role in The Playbirds (1978), in which she was cast as a policewoman working undercover as a nude model. Although her lack of acting training was evident, The Playbirds was a commercial success. Like Come Play with Me it was extensively trailed in Sullivan's magazines. She made many public appearances at this time, promoting her films in regional cinemas, opening shops and restaurants, and raising money for the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals. At the height of her fame she was also working behind the counter in Sullivan's sex shops, mainly in the Whitehouse shop in Norbury. She continued working as a call girl, which she had done since her early modelling days. She then made a cameo appearance in Confessions from the David Galaxy Affair (1979), which was a flop, and played the title role in Queen of the Blues (1979). She appeared in other sex movies such as Eskimo Nell (1975), Intimate Games (1976) and Derek Ford's What's Up Superdoc! (1978).\n\nParagraph 20: Joe Mott insists that he will soon re-open his casino. The English Cecil \"The Captain\" Lewis and South African Piet \"The General\" Wetjoen, who fought each other during the Boer War, are now good friends, and both insist that they'll soon return to their nations of origin. Harry Hope has not left the bar since his wife Bess's death 20 years ago. He promises that he'll walk around the block on his birthday, which is the next day. Pat McGloin says he hopes to be reinstated into the police force, but is waiting for the right moment. Ed Mosher prides himself on his ability to give incorrect change, but he kept too much of his illegitimate profits to himself and was fired; he says he will get his job back someday. Hugo Kalmar is drunk and passed out for most of the play; when he is conscious, he pesters the other patrons to buy him a drink. Chuck Morello says that he will marry Cora tomorrow.  Larry Slade is a former syndicalist-anarchist who looks pityingly on the rest. Don Parritt is a former anarchist who shows up later in the play to talk about his mother (Larry's ex-girlfriend) to Larry; specifically her arrest due to her involvement in the anarchist movement.\n\nParagraph 21: In 1997, the television show 20/20 featured an exposÃ© on hazing in the sorority system that included a hazing by three members of Kappa Kappa Gamma at DePauw University in Greenpaw, Indiana, and a local sorority Lambda Delta Sigma at Concordia College in Saint Paul, Minnesota. The three members of Kappa Kappa Gamma, on November 6, 1997, were accused of branding three pledges with cigarettes in a family hazing rite after a night of heavy drinking. After being burned, the pledges were encouraged to streak across campus and to grovel for cigarettes at a fraternity house. The result was severe enough to send one of the pledges to the hospital with minor burn injuries. The discovery of the incident caused investigations by the sorority and campus to be launched. The members who were involved with the incident were not charged by the state of Indiana with criminal recklessness under the hazing statute, as had been reported. They did, however, face a possible trial for alcohol possession but due to difficulty proving who provided the alcohol, the members were given community service instead. DePauw's reaction to the hazing for the chapter was to put the chapter on social probation until Fall 1999 and cut its pledge class in half for two years. The thirteen members who had either been involved with the incident or had known about it were given one-semester suspensions and social probation for their participation, and were voted by their chapter to retain membership within the chapter.\n\nParagraph 22: In England, the common law of private international law applies the lex fori or encores any provision of the lex causae if the area of penal, even, and other public laws. This is a matter of justiciability, and not merely jurisdiction. That is to say, not only does the English court hold that it has no jurisdiction in the matter, it is unable to hear matters relating to penal, revenue, or other public laws as the recognition of foreign states is one of statecraft and is a power retained by the sovereign, not with the courts. The reasoning of the court in Australia through the spycatcher case was that complying with friendly foreign government decisions placed the courts in difficult positions in the future to determine matters which derived from the sovereign. This was confirmed in the UK through The Barakat Galleries v Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The identification of foreign penal laws or foreign revenge law is relatively straight forward, a foreign penal law is a law which imposes a fine and is paid to the state. English law considers this lex fori. Payment to a private individual is unlikely to be considered penal, even if the payment is seen as a penalty or deterrent. By contrast, a revenue law is one which a party cannot opt out of, enforcement cannot be by action in the English courts. The English courts determine a foreign revenue law on the ground that a party may receive a hand back as evidence that the obligation to pay the state is not a foreign revenue law. The third category of 'other public laws' is traditionally one which relate to a claim in action in which only a state can claim, such as tort damages and costs of quashing a rebellion/revolution. Any claim which is founded on a right which is uniquely governmental will not be adjudicated.\n\nParagraph 23: Record companies put forth huge sums of money to produce, release, and promote an album. Recording time, manufacturing, packaging, photos, distribution, marketing, and music videos are just some of the areas where the label must spend money on an act it has signed. The label usually absorbs these expenses, but in some artists' contracts, some of this money may be due back to the label, unless otherwise worded. Advances (upfront money that is paid directly to a recording artist) are normally always owed back to the label. Once (and if) the advance has been paid back from record sales, the artist then begins to see royalty payments for additional sales. Advancing an act money is a risk the label endures as it does not know how well the act's album will sell. Capitol Records suspended Linda Ronstadt's contract in the early 1970s, as Capitol had spent more money on Ronstadt then it had yielded. She continued to tour partly to pay Capitol back for her 1960s deal, and a string of hits in the mid-1970s allowed her to finally clear the debt. Record companies expect to make a profit, and little concern themselves with a given performer's lack of business or financial savvy, as artists such as George Michael have discovered. \"Walking out\" on a deal is very difficult or nearly impossible, as is attempting to strike a new deal without completing an old one. Donna Summer signed a new deal with Geffen Records in 1980, and released an album on Geffen. She was then told by her previous label, Polygram Records, that she owed them another album, per her agreement. She recorded and delivered an album to Polygram that the label released, and it became a hit. Summer then went back to recording for Geffen Records for her next project. The Mamas & the Papas were forced into a reunion, years after their 1968 breakup, by the letter of their Dunhill Records contract, which required one more album to be completed -which became 1971's People Like Us.\n\nParagraph 24: All parts of the plant have a strong garlic odour. The underground bulb is 1â2Â cm diameter, with a fibrous outer layer. The main stem grows to 30â120Â cm tall, bearing 2â4 leaves and an apical inflorescence 2â5Â cm diameter comprising a number of small bulbils and none to a few flowers, subtended by a basal bract. The leaves are slender hollow tubes, 15â60Â cm long and 2â4Â mm thick, waxy texture, with a groove along the side of the leaf facing the stem. The inflorescence is a tight umbel surrounded by a membranous bract in bud which withers when the flowers open. Each individual flower is stalked and has a pinkish-green perianth  long. There are six tepals, six stamens and a pistil formed from three fused carpels. Mixed with the flowers are several yellowish-brown bulbils. The fruit is a capsule but the seeds seldom set and propagation usually takes place when the bulbils are knocked off and grow into new plants. Plants with no flowers, only bulbils, are sometimes distinguished as the variety Allium vineale var. compactum, but this character is probably not taxonomically significant.\n\nParagraph 25: Unnimaya (Mohini), a young girl is married to Palakunnath Namboothiri (Jagannatha Varma), a man in his sixties. She is his fourth wife. Unnimaya is an educated girl hailing from Kizhakkedath Mana, a progressive family in Kerala. Due to various social and economic factors, she is compelled to marry Palakunnath Namboothiri, a rich gentleman. Coming from a progressive household, Unnimaya finds it hard to adjust with the severe orthodox practices at her new home. The sudden death of her husband brings her face-to-face with the customary rituals practiced among Namboothiri community towards widowed women. She realizes that her widowhood makes her almost a shunned individual - one who cannot participate in any celebrations, or even attend any music/dance events or performances. Kunjunni Namboothiri (Manoj K. Jayan), the elder son of Palakkunath, is the only person who shows compassion and support towards her. Kunjunni is actively involved in reformation among the Namboothiris and is considered as a rebel among the orthodox community. Unnimaya meets Madhavan (Vineeth), an upcoming Kathakali artist, and falls in love with him. They share some intimate moments, and later Unnimaya realizes that she is pregnant. The orthodox Namboothiri community is shocked when it learns about her pregnancy and decides to excommunicate her through Smarthavicharam. A group of senior Namboothiris, under the leadership of Moothedath Bhattathiri (Thilakan), conducts a series of rituals, first to extract the name of the one who impregnated her, and then later, to throw her out of the community. Unnimaya expects Madhavan to come save her, but he is unable to muster the courage to rescue her. Realizing that he is a coward and that she cannot expect him to deliver her out of the situation, Unnimaya decides to stand up to the orthodox Namboothiris. She answers their questions with clarity and confidence, angering them further. Ultimately, the decision is made to excommunicate her, and all the necessary rituals are completed. Kunjunni arrives as her savior. He gives her shelter at his home. The progressive Yogakshema Sabha, that he is part of, finds his ways too bohemian and dismisses him from the group. Madhavan, realizing his mistake, arrives to accept Unnimaya, but now she shows him the door declaring that he is not the father of her unborn child and that the fathers are Arjuna, Bhima, Nala (the heroic characters performed by Madhavan as part of his dance performances). Unnimaya involves herself in social service and becomes a Congress volunteer deciding to do something for the downtrodden society.\n\nParagraph 26: Featuring Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant as The Doctor. This fortnightly magazine and trading card game partwork from GE Fabbri lasted over four years, with five sets of cards being released within that time. The first set, \"Exterminator\", featured 275 cards including characters from both the first and second series, as well as the 2005 Christmas special. The second set, \"Annihilator\", included 100 cards featuring characters from the second series and the 2006 Christmas special. The third set, \"Invader\", included 225 cards featuring characters from the third series. The fourth set, \"Ultimate Monsters\", included 225 cards and was the first set to venture back into Classic Who, featuring monsters and villains featured with all ten doctors. The fifth and final set, \"Devestator\", included 250 cards featuring characters from the 2007 Christmas special and the fourth series. In addition to these 1075 cards, a further 31 cards were produced â an exclusive 18 card \"Daleks vs. Cybermen\" mini-set, issued with issue 18; an exclusive 10 card \"Sarah Jane Adventures\" mini-set, issued with issue #62; the 'Dalek Blaster' bonus card, issued with the Invader launch issue; the 'Psychic Paper' bonus card, issued with the very first issue; and 'Super Rose', the ultimate \"Gold\" card, found in only 1 in every 1000 packs of cards.\n\nParagraph 27: In late 1983, Party Secretary of Shenzhen Mayor Liang Xiang led a team to Singapore to study its mass transit system. Upon returning it was decided that  on each side of Shennan Avenue should be protected as a green belt, and to set aside a  wide median reserved for a light rail or light metro line. In 1984, the \"Shenzhen Special Economic Zone Master Plan (1985â2000)\" pointed out that, with the growing population and traffic in Shenzhen, a light metro system would not have sufficient capacity to meet future demand. Instead the report proposed a heavy rail subway line to be built along Shennan Avenue. The project was finally approved by the Central Planning Department in 1992.\n\nParagraph 28: After the Civil War, the area began to grow as coal production escalated in the state of West Virginia and abundant water made the generation of power inexpensive.  In the early part of the 1900s, a dam was constructed across the river from Glen Ferris.  Trains operated on both sides of the river, carrying passengers as well as coal.  In 1917, Union Carbide purchased a small hydro electrice plant in Glen Ferris, the brick remains of which can still be seen on the edge of the Kanawha River and which is being presently renovated.   While continuing to operate this small plant, in 1929-30, Carbide built a much larger ferro-alloys plant at Alloy, a few miles downriver from Glen Ferris, which, at that time, was the world's largest ferro-alloys plant, employing some 2800 people, during its heyday from the time of its construction through the early 1960s. In order to generate power for the larger plant by diverting water from the New River, the company had a 3-mile long tunnel built through the mountain at Hawks Nest. The rock through which the tunnel was built consisted of 98% pure silica and caused acute silica poisoning among hundreds of unprotected workers, many of whom died.  Many who died were buried close by in mass graves on the property which is now the Hawks Nest Country Club.  At the time, the nearby town of Gauley Bridge became known as \"the town of the walking dead\".  The disaster became the focus of Congressional hearings in Washington, D.C., in the mid-thirties, and acute silicosis was identified as an occupational illness for the first time.  The town of Glen Ferris followed the pattern already set by mine companies in the area.  Union Carbide built a majority of the homes in Glen Ferris, as well as in other towns in the Upper Kanawha Valley and leased them to workers and their families.  During its heyday, Union Carbide also provided a recreation hall in the upper end of the village.  A post office/general store, an elementary school, a tennis court, a bowling alley, and a playground also served the residents.  After the 1950s, as plant production declined, Union Carbide began to sell the houses to their occupants.  In the 1970s, several homes were constructed on the mountainside above Glen Ferris in the north end of town; these would be Glen Ferris' largest homes and lead to its continued development as a place where people chose to live, primarily for its scenic views and in contrast to surrounding towns along Route 60.  In recent years, several even larger homes have been built on the northern edge of Glen Ferris, close to Gauley Bridge.  The elementary school was closed in 1961; the apostolic church stands there now. Nearby whitewater rafting on the New River Gorge has brought many tourists to the town.\n\nParagraph 29: Deoli Fish Farm, (15Â km from New Bilaspur township towards Mandi just below the Shimla-Mandi Road). Comprising 4.4 hectares comes in existence 1962. It consists of two big brood stock tanks and 14 nursery ponds. The total outlay on setting up this hatchery was 3.68 lacks. In beginning the farms activities were limited to meet the seed stocking requirements of Gobind Sagar reservoir, but its targets were increased year to year and research, training, technique and demonstration brought under the farm programmed. During 1978 fish species being record at the farm were demonstrated to the people by constructing a small aquarium. During 1989 a training center and Hostel were constructed within the farm premises so that training course be imparted to the departmental personnel and interested fish farmers. Now training camps are being conducted with modern fish breeding and culture technique training are imparted. This farm has not only historic importance but is can be known as a center breeding excellent training in fish culture and research programmed. Keeping in view the commendable work done in the field of breeding, the Punjab University extended its recognition for undertaking research work at this farm. The Deoli fish farm has played a major role in breeding fish population in Gobind Sagar reservoir, income of the reservoir fishermen and their lives prosperous. For the first time Silver Carp fish was stocked in Gobind Sagar reservoir from Deoli farm. Every year 30-40 lacks mirror carp fingerlings are being produced at the farm and these are stocked in Gobind Sagar reservoir and other water bodies in the State and distributed to the private fish farms. Due to regular stocking in Gobind Sagar reservoir for the last decade at has a unique capacity of fish production per hectare in the country and this credit goes to Deoli farm. The scientists of ICAR and State Fisheries Department initiated a joint research project viz. 'Genetic Rejuvenation of Fish Stock in HP'. The 'Bio-Science Department' started this project entire funded about 18.00 lacks. A quality strain of fish is being reared under this project and distributed to the fish farmers. Under this technique demonstration programme a new scheme namely 'Fish Culture in Running Water' was introduced for the first time at the farm. This scheme was observed suitable especially in high altitude of Himachal Pradesh on the basis of success of this technique the Govt of India incorporated this scheme under the Centrally Sponsored Fish Farmers' Development Agency subsidy programme. The NABARD Bank has also approved this scheme namely 'Fish Culture in Running Water' which resulted in setting up of about 1000 units in the State. In recent years sport fisheries is fostering in the Gobind Sagar reservoir which clearly indicates vast potential of attracting tourists. The Deptt regularly organizes angling completions every year. In Gobind Sagar and Mahseer fish which is an important fish of this reservoir. As the breeding of Mahseer fish is not an easy job hence the Punjab University and State Fisheries Department jointly prepared a project of Rs. 19.00 lacks it was got approved from ICAR. Present hatchery set up at the Deoli farm has been constructed under this scheme. Under this scheme matured Mahseer fish would be brought from his habitat and bred in comfortable situation.\n\nParagraph 30: Baum described The Sexual Brain as engaging and readable, and ideal for educated laypeople. However, he criticized LeVay for being unaware of some relevant research, and making a number of factual errors, such as that orgasm is caused by the neurotransmitter oxytocin, that female rats fail to display maternal behavior after hypophysectomy, that lesions of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus reduce presentational behavior displayed by female monkeys, that antiandrogenic drugs block the masculinization of the sexually dimorphic subdivision of the medial preoptic area in male rats, and that vaginal olfactory cues are the primary determinants of masculine sexual arousal in male primates. Publishers Weekly described the book as an \"expert, drily written, often technical account of the biological basis of human sexual behavior and orientation\" and predicted that it would be equally as controversial as LeVay's \"1991 Science article describing a difference in the hypothalamic brain structure of homosexual and heterosexual men.\"The Sexual Brain has been criticized by authors such as the queer theorist Robert McRuer, the philosopher Timothy F. Murphy, the biologist Steven Rose, the classicist Bruce Thornton, the psychiatrist and medical historian Vernon Rosario, and the philosopher Edward Stein. McRuer compared The Sexual Brain to the political scientist Charles Murray and the psychologist Richard Herrnstein's The Bell Curve (1994), arguing that just as Murray and Herrnstein presented inequality as inevitable rather than the consequence of economic institutions that could be changed, LeVay failed to question the institution of heterosexuality. Murphy maintained that LeVay failed to show conclusively that the differences in brain structure he found between gay men and straight men were not due to AIDS. Rose criticized the publicity that surrounded the publication of The Sexual Brain, arguing that LeVay over-stated the importance of his findings, behavior which Rose considered similar to that of researchers such as the geneticist Dean Hamer. Rose noted that the sexual orientation of the men in LeVay's hypothalamus study was presumed rather than demonstrated. Thornton questioned the value of LeVay's work, writing that while LeVay asserted that the future would bring progress in understanding the development of sexuality, it was uncertain what good such knowledge would accomplish. Rosario accused LeVay of biological determinism and reductionism. Stein criticized LeVay for failing to discuss social constructionism, despite its relevance to his topic.Kirkus Reviews wrote in 2010 that The Sexual Brain was \"well received, but soon out of date\" because of subsequent scientific research.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nThe text explains that there is limited information about the people of GÄ§argÄ§ur in earlier times. One source of information is the Dejma list, which mentions GÄ§argÄ§ur in connection with Ä¦al Samudi. It suggests that during the Middle Ages, GÄ§argÄ§ur was likely a small rural community. An abbey was established in Ä¦al GÄ§argÄ§ur during this time, but it is unknown when and why it was abandoned. It is speculated that constant pirate attacks on the village may have led to a decline in population. During these raids, houses were built with secret rooms for residents, particularly females, to hide in. The streets and alleys were also designed in a way to confuse invaders. The pirate raids continued even after GÄ§argÄ§ur became a parish. On one occasion, the residents sought refuge in the parish church and vowed to hold an annual pilgrimage to the shrine of MellieÄ§a if they were unharmed. Since nobody was harmed or enslaved on that occasion, the tradition of the pilgrimage began.\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from. The answer format must be like \"Paragraph 1\", \"Paragraph 2\", etc.\n\nThe answer is: ", "input_tokens": 9595}
