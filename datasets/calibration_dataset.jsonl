{"article": "You are given a meeting transcript and a query containing a question or instruction. Answer the query in one or more sentences.\n\nTranscript:\nProject Manager: Excellent . So um I sent you the agenda , it was on the {disfmarker} in the project documents . I don't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it . Anyway , it's {disfmarker} the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's {disfmarker} we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Right .\nProject Manager: Okay . Um , do you wanna start again ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager: Let me {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Right s {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: we've got forty minutes .\nIndustrial Designer: so I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} You haven't made a PowerPoint , okay .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , I I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um mm , {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Let's hope the pen holds out . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: okay , so basically I'll start off by {disfmarker} uh {vocalsound} I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay , so uh I'll start again with a brief introduction to {disfmarker} connect that anyway {disfmarker} brief introduction to the insides of a remote control\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components . Yeah . Okay , so w what you see here is {disfmarker} so {vocalsound} this is the outside of the remote , right ? If you open it , you have a circuit board here , right ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and this is the chip that I was talking about last time . This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here , which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here . If you flip the printed circuit board , and this is th the most important point here ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh {vocalsound} everything else is kind of {disfmarker} Okay , so if you flip the circuit board , this is what it looks like . So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ and uh\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: on pressing this button I {disfmarker} a circuit completes , the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes goes out through there . {vocalsound} So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make , you can ge get them printed as you want to ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so w we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost , the way we want to have . Right ? So that's the important point here ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: so these are the different options that we have . Okay . So the batteries , I'll start with the battery , right ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our {disfmarker} uh the cells , yeah ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh thes these are the kind {disfmarker} different kind of batteries that the company makes , right ? So . And dynamos . Um {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Does that mean like a wind-up one ?\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} A wind-up remote .\nIndustrial Designer: So uh I don't know if {disfmarker} even if you want to consider this ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: but these are the different things that the company makes , so th they'll they'll {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: since uh they'll come internally from the company , they'll be eas uh cheaper , uh all these options .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So {vocalsound} the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones .\nMarketing: You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching T_V_ .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: And charging their remote ,\nMarketing: Yeah , and stop worrying about the whole R_S_I_ from the remote thing , 'cause that's just {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , it's a good option .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} So what was what was this k ka\nIndustrial Designer: The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nProject Manager: Uh yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . For a remote , 'cause you {disfmarker} Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: And the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also {vocalsound} made by the company .\nMarketing: Yay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Environment friendly . Okay {vocalsound} um so I'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective .\nProject Manager: Yeah {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: There are different cases that can be provided . They can be {disfmarker} basically the shape of the cases , they can be flat , they can be curved with uh one-sided curved and one side flat ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: and they can be curved with {disfmarker} on both the sides .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} These are the three options , right ? Um {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control , yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , would it be flat on both the sides , would be curved from one side , or whatever {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: mm-hmm . Yeah , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: uh there were different kind of supplements available , um like it can be in plastic , rubber , wood , or titanium , right ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Wo wo wood .\nMarketing: Did you say wool ?\nProject Manager: Wood , wood .\nMarketing: Wood . Oh right .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} Not wool . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} A fluffy remote . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah , you'll understand why when we get to my presenta {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: Oh really ? {vocalsound} Okay . Um the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Huh .\nIndustrial Designer: so uh we can use even um {vocalsound} a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh {vocalsound} uh some space design equipment , so it's kind of um uh it'll be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company , but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface . If we choose this , we cannot use titanium . For for these two we can use titanium , wood , rubber , or plastic .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh okay , the interface options now . So {vocalsound} we can have push-buttons , like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push-buttons .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Ooh . Uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Sony .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Sony Ericsson mobile phones has it .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah , something like that .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} So , and they have {disfmarker} they can even have an an integrated uh push-button inside the scrolling thing .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: The scroll plus push . So this is something that has been recently developed by the company , um {vocalsound} in the last decade , so not too recent . And L_C_D_s , we can have L_C_D_s . So these two are recent and and this is q quite old .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} The various electronic options are um uh {vocalsound} so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at uh {disfmarker} so there's there's a chip behind this one , right ? The P_C_B_ is uh inexpensive , so we can put put in uh whatever we want , but the various integrated circuit options are , we have either a simple one\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: or a regular or advanced . And uh the price goes up as we go down , obviously .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um {vocalsound} okay , so the good thing about uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that L_C_D_s can only come with the advanced chip .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um the {disfmarker} we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels . Right ? Um {vocalsound} and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Uh besides this in electr under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender , which is {vocalsound} {disfmarker} did not explained what i what it was , but I'm guessing that uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker . So I'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know , as soon as you press a button , it it mm uh give gives you feedback , one five or whatever . Yeah , on .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Um {vocalsound} and uh I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not , but anyway .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So , these are the different options that we have . Okay , so {vocalsound} th that's that's basically {disfmarker} now now uh I think that uh we can integrate um {vocalsound} uh you know , uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that , keep uh taking out things from this and uh underlining things that are important , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Excellent . Do you wanna stay somewhere near the board , so that if we need to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , yeah , sure . Sure . Yeah .\nProject Manager: you can sit down , but just {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we might need you to leap up .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nProject Manager: What are you , PowerPoint , or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Um I have some PowerPoint , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay .\nUser Interface: Oh . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand ?\nUser Interface: 'Kay .\nProject Manager: Some sort of radiation ?\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: No it's got its little camera in there , {vocalsound} plug it in {gap} .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , it should should do it . Yeah .\nMarketing: 'S a\nProject Manager: Right , interface concept .\nUser Interface: Okay . Um to be honest actually , I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the {disfmarker} this talk um this time , I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk .\nProject Manager: That's fine .\nUser Interface: So um yeah , this time um I might not have them on the slides but I {vocalsound} I can just mention them aw again .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Okay . So um I thought um I would also include the definition of user interface um so it's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um and and which {disfmarker} uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data . So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well , and colour , and so on .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Um um the method I {vocalsound} employed this time was {vocalsound} a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness and {vocalsound} also um {vocalsound} whether their appearance was was pleasant . Um {vocalsound} and then um {vocalsound} this uh this um {vocalsound} this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: So some findings um {vocalsound} um . So in in the case of many user interfaces , they're just so full of buttons that it's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and it's just confusing , it takes y know time to learn . Um {vocalsound} okay , and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found . Okay , some of them are here .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Um {vocalsound} well the picture is not very clear , but as you can see , there are actu oi , oh oh oh , {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: sorry for that . 'S go back .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's nice one .\nUser Interface: Ah , no , please . Okay , so yeah , they're quite big and have many many buttons . Actually {vocalsound} of the {disfmarker} of all these I personally p prefer this one , because it's it's the smallest and and with with least {disfmarker} uh with the smallest number of buttons as well . And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice .\nMarketing: Ugly .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Um okay . So let's carry on with this . Um {disfmarker} So uh um o other findings {disfmarker} um some new things um used , uh some of them were mentioned already by our Technical um Designer uh . {vocalsound} Our own company has developed a new in user interface {disfmarker} uh wait , no this is not the one . Okay , there is a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we can uh include voice recognition and um it allows {disfmarker} i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the L_C_ display .\nProject Manager: It's {disfmarker} yeah .\nUser Interface: Um s another new development is a scroll button , which was also th also already mentioned . And uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed {vocalsound} a new um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh programmable speech uh {vocalsound} mm sorry uh speaker unit I guess it's {disfmarker} it should be .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Um and this means that um once uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition , but it's {disfmarker} once once the mm {vocalsound} um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker , there can be a um pre-programmed answer , for example , you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever .\nProject Manager: Uh-huh , hi {vocalsound} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: So {vocalsound} I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh sorry , uh can you go back for a second ? Um {vocalsound} uh are you sure wha what this means , a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display ? Uh {vocalsound} oh yeah are th\nProject Manager: It's like the {disfmarker} like you said , no ? The scroll scroll wheel .\nMarketing: Yeah , you can't {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: No no , the scroll button is a different thing . I I have a picture if you {vocalsound} {disfmarker} just a moment , I'll {vocalsound} I'll show you . I wasn't completely sure myself , but I think it's just like um {vocalsound} it's it's a wheel , it's like not separate buttons .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Oh okay , the iPod thing , yeah .\nUser Interface: Look , this one here .\nMarketing: Oh , it's like the iPod .\nUser Interface: But I'm I'm not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round ,\nMarketing: G yeah , no , you can .\nUser Interface: it's like you press this or this or {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Uh it's the iPod uh kind of uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: It's like it's like where you {disfmarker} you know how you have your your mouse , and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: Alright , right . Okay , okay .\nMarketing: and it {disfmarker} yeah . It is {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: So instead of going down you just spin {disfmarker} yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: You just go round\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: and it is a bit weird at first , but it's actually very like fast .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh-huh .\nMarketing: I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: so it's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: Do you know , if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you're looking for something at T_ , then it's a lot faster than the wheel ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: but you've got a lot less control over it .\nIndustrial Designer: Right . So maybe I should include that here as well ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Mm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: L_C_D_s um plus spinning .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: Okay , and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: It {vocalsound} it has to be small , simple . Okay , we decided to include voice recognition , so to have the standard uh major buttons like on , off , um ch the channels and and then um volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen . Um and I I also thought uh {vocalsound} if we want to keep it small and nice um and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button , I thought it could be for for voice like , I dunno , it mm like on a um i like it used to be on Walkmans or something . There is {vocalsound} uh I think there is no reason why we couldn't use something like this for for the remote control .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: So yeah , that's uh that's it .\nProject Manager: Excellent . Okay , straight to trends , and then we can discuss it all at once .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: Okay , I've put the copy of the presentation in um the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: The project documents .\nMarketing: yeah .\nProject Manager: Excellent . If you two could both do that as well , in case we need to refer to it .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Cool .\nProject Manager: Here it comes . Okay .\nMarketing: Fabulous . Okay , cool . Um so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Okay . Right . Now , the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect , which is twice as important as the third a aspect . So , I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Okay .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: which I think given the target group is what you would expect , really .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Um , you know , people want something new , something technologically innovative and different , so the whole idea with the L_C_D_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like , quite the thing to go for .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: And um , yeah it wants to look fancy , fancy look and feel .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: So um {vocalsound} uh maybe uh as you're discussing things , is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here ?\nMarketing: So {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah , yeah , sure . Yeah .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right . So mm uh so it {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: That's over on the interface ,\nIndustrial Designer: {disfmarker} yeah ,\nProject Manager: if if you could put {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: so probably voice recognition is is kind of important , right ?\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Um and an\nProject Manager: And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: yeah . Okay , I I have a point about L_C_D_ ,\nProject Manager: so that means we need an advanced thing .\nIndustrial Designer: I dunno if it is the right point to take it up . W uh L_C_D_s are basically for feedback , right , to the user who's pressing buttons ,\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: and the feedback can come through television itself , so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote ?\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Depends how fast your television runs , really , don't don't you think ? I mean we've got one of those um Telewest boxes\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: and you put the number in the remote and then you wait and then it goes to the T_V_ and then you wait , and then it comes , so i it actually takes quite a long time . And if you get the number in wrong , then it's a bit of a pain ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Right . {gap}\nMarketing: so I think , you know , a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that . But like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen ,\nMarketing: You know ? Yeah .\nProject Manager: so if you're watching something {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: That's true , yeah , that's also {disfmarker}\nMarketing: And i it would be like {disfmarker} I mean if you could make it integrate with the T_V_ then it could come up with new information about what's on , and you could just see that on the remote rather than {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah . Rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: But um I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone , you know , like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screen's protected so it doesn't actually get scratched .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control , you know or like a minimalist remote control .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: So you got your buttons one to nine , your on and off and your volume on that\nIndustrial Designer: Mm right .\nMarketing: and then if you want to mess about with it , you flip it open and ,\nProject Manager: And then you can flip it open .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nMarketing: yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go because of style and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah , I think so .\nMarketing: Yeah , so that kind of decides your whole chip thing .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: You you agree ? Maarika , yeah ?\nUser Interface: Yep , yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Right .\nIndustrial Designer: So L_C_D_s , yeah , definitely .\nMarketing: Okay ?\nIndustrial Designer: Go on .\nMarketing: Cool . Okay , apparently , fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Sorry , I discovered clip art . {vocalsound} Um so these will be an important feature for clothes , shoes and furniture . So I mean , I'm taking this to mean , you know , curviness . Do you know ? 'Cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables . You know ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: and possibly even uneven ,\nMarketing: Yeah , bit of asymmetry and stuff .\nProject Manager: like not not symmet yeah .\nMarketing: But that would be a good way to to get in the whole um R_S_I_ issue in there ,\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: because {disfmarker} I mean if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand ha right hands\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: so you wanna {disfmarker} you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the right hand .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: Um yeah\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: , I'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Something a bit squishy and {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , we we have\nMarketing: but I mean y you have to {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: So it could be like a rubbery {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: we have rubber ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} yeah , uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: but there is a problem that I forgot to discuss with the {disfmarker} um with using {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Well I suppose you wouldn't get a remote uh {disfmarker} an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: Yeah , and it'd help if you drop it , it protects it as well .\nMarketing: Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: To some degree .\nIndustrial Designer: So if if we use uh latex cases , they won't allow us to use solar cells , as an energy source that is the constraint ,\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: so um we could use {vocalsound} titanium , wood or plastic uh or uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Or if we want to use the the latex , then we have to go with one of the other um power things .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , w energy source .\nMarketing: If it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} From {vocalsound} from bouncing it .\nMarketing: you could just {vocalsound} bounce it up and down {vocalsound} .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , tap it on the desk , yeah . {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: You can have it as like a little ball to bounce , that flips open . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} Um so yeah , um okay .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Mm . So probably double curved surface is the way to go , yeah , {gap} .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Or or curved at one end and flat on the top , because I I'm not sure if it is flat on both both the sides , then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons , etcetera . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: You have to have a certain element of flatness , I think .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: It it depends on the whole ergonomics of it , you know , it's like how you put your hands so y it's the least movement basically .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Yeah , singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much , does it ?\nProject Manager: Uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: It uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: No , I d I don't think it makes a lot of difference . I I have one of those s slidey phones and I mean the back is essentially straight ,\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: but it's curvy , so .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh I think uh {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah , 'cause the {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Besides , you have four sides to a thing , so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: and , you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing ?\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh\nProject Manager: Dunno .\nIndustrial Designer: because um {vocalsound} according to the information that I have , I think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is {disfmarker} are these three . Uh eith either we have uh a flat surfaced uh case or a curved surfaced case .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: It does not say anything about uh whether technically , you know , this this stuff is available at all .\nProject Manager: Nothing to {vocalsound} open them .\nMarketing: Yeah . Uh it's it's more about the protecting the L_C_D_ , which I think is where it came from .\nIndustrial Designer: Right , yeah , yeah .\nMarketing: But no , my research didn't tell me anything , which is why we have all the pictures ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nMarketing: 'cause I had nothing better to do with my time .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Okay .\nMarketing: Okay , cool .\nProject Manager: Anything else ? What've we got ?\nMarketing: Uh combine style with a level of functionality , um beauty and practicality and a thing of beauty and p function .\nIndustrial Designer: Cool , thanks .\nProject Manager: Okay , so .\nMarketing: Okay ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Thanks\nProject Manager: Looking at what we've got , we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . Let's let's try to r rub off things and {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah , rub off some of those .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , so um {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: hand dynamos are definitely out , right ? {vocalsound} You you got a wind {gap} dynamo , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Yeah ,\nUser Interface: Yeah uh-hum yeah .\nProject Manager: it's not {disfmarker} that's not streamlined and sexy , {vocalsound} having a having a wind up .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Um {vocalsound} kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal ,\nProject Manager: I think tha\nIndustrial Designer: but uh {vocalsound} it's {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} It's about the practicality of it really , isn't it ? You know ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . As against a watch , which constantly keeps moving ,\nMarketing: I mean if {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: this this thing will have to be tapped every time , which which might be very frustrating for the user .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Depends how much how much movement it really needs .\nIndustrial Designer: Kinetic energy it needs {disfmarker} I don't have too much technical information on that ,\nProject Manager: Pr presumably if they're suggesting it , then we could use it .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah , right . Okay , let's keep it option uh keep an option ,\nProject Manager: I'd I'd keep it on .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah . Um {vocalsound} the flat co completely flat case is definitely out , right ? It has to be at least curved from one side , yeah .\nProject Manager: We don't want that\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah\nProject Manager: it's no {disfmarker} it's not not vegetable .\nUser Interface: it's {disfmarker} yeah . {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Um {vocalsound} okay , we still have all all the options . Wood , do you think wood will be a good idea ?\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: N wood is {disfmarker} I can't n {vocalsound} how do you uh I mean you can't keep it really small uh\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nUser Interface: you can't make it like thin and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: I can't imagine a m wooden remote control .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nUser Interface: The wood thing . Because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in , so I mean if the case {disfmarker} you add the case and it it becomes a bit bulky\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah {vocalsound} if if it is really thin if it is really thin it it's likely to break ,\nUser Interface: wi mm-mm yeah .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: it's it's much more uh {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah , and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences , I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: U yeah wood is not really {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: Well it's not very cleanable either ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} That's true .\nMarketing: do you know .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: It's it's not {vocalsound} a practical {disfmarker} I mean it's it's alright for a table , but for a remote control , you know .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nMarketing: And splinters and stuff and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: okay {vocalsound} wood is out .\nMarketing: It just m doesn't make any sense , I think is the thing with wood .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nUser Interface: Yeah , yeah , in the case of remote control not really .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay , now for the really interesting stuff , the interface .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right , so uh the the push-buttons is is our expertise uh in the industry ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: but uh it seems to be {vocalsound} out of trend , you know , nobody seems to be {disfmarker}\nMarketing: You have to have some push-buttons , don't you ?\nUser Interface: Yeah , but you {disfmarker} um I think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them , wouldn't you ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm right .\nMarketing: G yeah , yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , so for channel numbers but {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh , if if we have L_C_D_ displays , that opens up a whole world , you know , if you have an L_C_D_ display , then mm you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display .\nUser Interface: But I th yeah but {vocalsound} I think the L_C_D_ display is kind of {disfmarker} yeah , it's faster\nProject Manager: Just for fast {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: with a m yeah and w if we dis and when we s um {vocalsound} discussed that we might like this flipping open thing , then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: but if you do want to use L_C_D_ , then you flip it open ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: but it's it it's more time-consuming .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made , where , you know , the buttons that people use all the time , you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm right .\nProject Manager: And it {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nProject Manager: yeah {vocalsound} L_ {disfmarker} L_C_D_ .\nIndustrial Designer: So uh in in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options . Do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine ? Or do we have just uh channel plus , channel minus , just to just to scroll ?\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} No , no , I mean mm we we definitely need the the numbers ,\nIndustrial Designer: The numbers .\nUser Interface: because it's {disfmarker} uh otherwise people don't want to flip through all the channels . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as L_C_D_ ?\nIndustrial Designer: Or {vocalsound} on the L_C_D_ we can , you know {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nMarketing: G yeah ,\nUser Interface: Yeah , I would say buttons ,\nMarketing: I would think buttons , yeah .\nProject Manager: Buttons .\nUser Interface: because it's {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay .\nMarketing: It's it's the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: So mm {disfmarker}\nMarketing: I think the thing is , so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel , then it should be easier to use than any other remote ,\nUser Interface: I\nProject Manager: Mm . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: and then if someone wants to , you know , change the contrast on their T_V_ and {disfmarker} they should be able to do that and it should be accessible ,\nIndustrial Designer: Alright .\nMarketing: but , you know , I mean most of the time {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: I mean there's a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the T_V_ , I think is the the the issue there .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay , so buttons definitely in but {disfmarker} oh shall we uh try to draw a prec um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I think that's what {vocalsound} you guys are gonna do next ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Uh okay .\nProject Manager: so if we put down the key um {vocalsound} things that we want .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay , okay , so the components .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right , so uh what about the the scrolling uh ?\nUser Interface: Yeah but n I I'm not completely um completely clear uh I {vocalsound} yeah , about the spinning wheel . So I think it {vocalsound} it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound} E either or {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: it's uh {disfmarker} you can al include everything in the spinning if you\nMarketing: G yeah .\nProject Manager: Just spinning and not scrolling , I would say .\nUser Interface: {disfmarker} yeah , yeah ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel ,\nUser Interface: in that case .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: so you have to decide whether {disfmarker} you you know , you want to be going so fast or not . But I mean the the thing with this whole {disfmarker} if y you're planning on making it out of rubber , on the basis that it's spongy , then I'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work .\nProject Manager: Hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: But if you've got a {disfmarker} if if you've got a flipped thing , effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side , but you folded it in half .\nUser Interface: Ah , but I mean you can {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side .\nProject Manager: Th {vocalsound} that would be on one side , uh-huh .\nIndustrial Designer: I'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber . {vocalsound} Uh i it {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: No , I think it's just the casing rubber on the outside .\nUser Interface: Yeah , I um I think so too , I mean the case would be {disfmarker}\nMarketing: You want an outside of rubber\nUser Interface: yeah the case would be rubber and the the buttons ,\nMarketing: and then open it up and {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Or or at the corners , edges , just the edges covered by rubber or something like that .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nUser Interface: rubber buttons , but then {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nMarketing: Or maybe like interchangeable cases .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: 'Cause I know like we're going back to iPods again n the whole spinning wheel , but I have like a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know , obviously my iPod's not made of rubber , but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it\nIndustrial Designer: Right , right .\nMarketing: and I can change the colour , theoretically , to match my outfit .\nProject Manager: Mm .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Right ,\nProject Manager: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: okay , so so that gives us a more trendy look as well . Um {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now .\nIndustrial Designer: Right . Yeah , and uh we're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway , right ?\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} That's right ,\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: that's what they're after .\nIndustrial Designer: So I'll rub that out . {vocalsound} And uh colours can be provided with the case rather than {disfmarker} Um but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such , you know , just keep it black , or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nUser Interface: Yeah I think we {disfmarker} um it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company , so would it be like yellow , grey and black or something , or {disfmarker}\nMarketing: That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though .\nProject Manager: I guess .\nUser Interface: Yeah , does {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Bananas . {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Yeah . Banana's yellow , {vocalsound} yeah , definitely .\nMarketing: Yeah , but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote {vocalsound} the colour like vegetable colours , do you know ? So you could have like {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple\nProject Manager: Green . Yeah .\nMarketing: and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it .\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Okay . Um {vocalsound} okay , if you g go over to uh the integrated circuits . Uh since we're having L_C_D_s there there's no way that we're will be able to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} We need the advanced {disfmarker} yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: um what we do need to consider , however , is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering , but since L_C_D_s seems to be uh a definite yes ,\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: so {vocalsound} it seems to be one area where we would want to spend .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: So I'll rub off the other two .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: So are we discounting solar energy because rubber's gonna be used in there somewhere or {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: That was the {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Oh is {disfmarker} oh the constraint was uh {disfmarker}\nMarketing: {vocalsound} If {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: We can't have solar panels with rubber , so .\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nMarketing: solar panels with the rubber .\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah . So {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah , okay , so we lose that I think .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} Shall we go for {disfmarker} if we're going for rubber , we think uh on {disfmarker} as our case , and then {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} And the buttons as well , I think . Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: I think uh {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: We've got five more minutes .\nIndustrial Designer: we'll have uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} uh using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one , I mean , a although it does seem uh interesting .\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: But it does not hold any advantages as such for a {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: It's just a gimmick .\nProject Manager: Yeah ,\nIndustrial Designer: yeah .\nProject Manager: mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay . Uh okay , so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback , right ? It it says uh the things that you type in or something like that , so {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm . Yeah . I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then I'd put them in ,\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Ye yeah , {vocalsound} we we don't have too much information about it , um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: but if it's {disfmarker} Yeah .\nUser Interface: Yeah , but it it {disfmarker} I think it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company , yeah .\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} It's from the company , so {disfmarker}\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah , okay , so so th this is in as well then , the sample speaker .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: Okay . And the case is curved on one side , but then flat flat , so it's flipped into each other .\nIndustrial Designer: Flat on the top . Yeah .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Okay .\nProject Manager: Can I pull the {vocalsound} thing out the back of your computer ?\nMarketing: Yeah , sure j\nProject Manager: Just so we can {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Sorry , do you want me to {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Nothing , it's right , I'm just {disfmarker} There we go .\nMarketing: What does um I_C_S_ mean ?\nIndustrial Designer: I_C_s ? Uh integrated circuits .\nMarketing: Okay , cool . So it's advanced integrated circuits ?\nIndustrial Designer: Yeah .\nProject Manager: Uh oh now I've gone too far .\nIndustrial Designer: Uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s , mm .\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nProject Manager: Yeah . We're on our way . Okay . {vocalsound} So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery , the advanced chip\nIndustrial Designer: Right .\nProject Manager: and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , um made out of rubber\nIndustrial Designer: Yep .\nProject Manager: and the buttons are also rubber . We're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel , and we're incorporating voice recognition . That's our overall concept ,\nUser Interface: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: and it's gonna look sort of vegetable ,\nMarketing: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: {vocalsound}\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nProject Manager: {vocalsound} and be in bright vegetable colours .\nUser Interface: Uh-huh . So {vocalsound} w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the L_C_D_ , or would it be on the outer {disfmarker}\nMarketing: Imagine it would be inside .\nProject Manager: I think it's on the {disfmarker}\nUser Interface: Okay .\nMarketing: So um actually that could like really cut down your thing ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm .\nMarketing: so you've got your outside , which is like minimalist , and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel , which you can incorporate buttons into .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm . Yeah , okay .\nMarketing: Um so you've still not got like a lot of stuff in the {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: Mm-mm .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: Yeah .\nMarketing: You've maybe got , you know {disfmarker} {vocalsound} like if you're modelling on iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel ,\nProject Manager: On the {disfmarker} Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: and four of the buttons are in the wheel , and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel ,\nProject Manager: In the centre ,\nMarketing: yeah .\nProject Manager: yeah , sure .\nUser Interface: Mm yeah .\nProject Manager: Okay , so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting . In the meantime , the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design ,\nIndustrial Designer: Mm-hmm .\nProject Manager: which I'll presume he'll work out what that means . Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation . And as well as that , the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nIndustrial Designer: Cool .\nProject Manager: Is that all okay ? And anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder , it would be good just so {disfmarker} in case we have to refer to it .\nUser Interface: Yeah .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , okay .\nUser Interface: Mm-hmm .\nMarketing: Cool , I'm gonna go and sit on my own .\nProject Manager: Y ah nobody wants to talk to you .\nMarketing: {vocalsound} I know , I'm hated .\nProject Manager: Unplug yourself .\nIndustrial Designer: {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Hmm . {vocalsound}\nMarketing: I've got a bit tangled up in all this {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: So but {disfmarker} shall I move away first or shall I stay here with {disfmarker}\nProject Manager: I dunno , maybe I would car\nUser Interface: we need to {disfmarker}\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: What did Industrial Designer think of the scroll wheel when presenting the user interface?\nAnswer:", "summary_gt": "", "input_tokens": 9023, "output_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 9023, "source_file": "qmsum.jsonl"}

Radio two . Hmm . Radio two .\nGrad E: Hello ?\nProfessor A: Wow .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm . Hi ?\nPhD B: Blow into it , it works really well .\nGrad F: Channel B .\nProfessor A: People say the strangest things when their microphones are on .\nPhD D: Channel four . Test .\nPhD C: Uh - oh .\nPhD D: OK .\nPhD C: Radio four .\nGrad E: Hello ?\nProfessor A: So everybody everybody 's on ?\nPhD D: Today 's\nProfessor A: Yeah . So y you guys had a {disfmarker} a meeting with uh {disfmarker} with Hynek which I unfortunately had to miss . Um and uh somebody\nPhD C: Mmm .\nProfessor A: eh e and uh I guess Chuck you weren't there either , so the uh\nPhD B: I was there .\nProfessor A: Oh you were there ?\nPhD B: With Hynek ?\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: So everybody knows what happened except me . OK . {vocalsound} Maybe somebody should tell me .\nPhD C: Oh yeah . Alright . Well . Uh first we discussed about some of the points that I was addressing in the mail I sent last week .\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: So . Yeah . About the um , well {disfmarker} the downsampling problem .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh and about the f the length of the filters and {disfmarker} Yeah .\nProfessor A: What was the {disfmarker} w what was the downsampling problem again ?\nPhD C: So we had {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: I forget .\nPhD C: So the fact that there {disfmarker} there is no uh low - pass filtering before the downsampling . Well .\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not uh the best w m\nProfessor A: Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah .\nPhD C: Well . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: So you could do a {disfmarker} you could do a stricter one .\nPhD D: System on\nProfessor A: Maybe . Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah . So we discussed about this , about the um {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: Was there any conclusion about that ?\nPhD C: Uh \" try it \" . Yeah .\nProfessor A: I see .\nPhD C: I guess .\nProfessor A: Yeah . So again this is th this is the downsampling {vocalsound} uh of the uh {disfmarker} the feature vector stream\nPhD C: Uh .\nProfessor A: and um Yeah I guess the {disfmarker} the uh LDA filters they were doing do have um {vocalsound} uh let 's see , so the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so uh the question is how far down they are at fifty {disfmarker} fifty hertz . Uh . {vocalsound} Um .\nPhD C: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Sorry at twenty - five hertz since they 're downsampling by two . So . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ?\nPhD C: We don't have yet\nProfessor A: Oh OK .\nPhD C: um {vocalsound} So , yeah .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: We should have a look first at , perhaps , {vocalsound} the modulation spectrum .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Um . So there is this , there is the um length of the filters . Um . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So the i this idea of trying to find filters with shorter delays . Um . We started to work with this .\nProfessor A: Hmm - hmm .\nPhD C: Mmm . And the third point um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} was the um , yeah , {vocalsound} the on - line normalization where , well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation {vocalsound} is a filter with some kind of delay\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: and that 's not taken into account right now . Um . Yeah . And there again , yeah . For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , \" we can try it but {disfmarker} \"\nProfessor A: Uh - huh .\nPhD C: Um .\nProfessor A: Try {disfmarker} try what ?\nPhD C: So try to um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} um take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: Mmm . And this {disfmarker} we 've not uh worked on this yet . Um , yeah . And so while discussing about these {disfmarker} these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's uh , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that {vocalsound} in the very low frequency , these filters don't {disfmarker} don't really remove a lot . {vocalsound} compared to the {disfmarker} to the uh standard RASTA filter . Uh and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it {disfmarker} it ,\nProfessor A: Right .\nPhD C: yeah , it removed this mean . Um . Yeah , but perhaps everything could {disfmarker} should be {disfmarker} could be in the filter , I mean , uh the {disfmarker} the mean normalization and {disfmarker} Yeah . So . Yeah . So basically that was {disfmarker} that 's {vocalsound} all we discussed about . We discussed about {vocalsound} good things to do also uh well , generally good stuff {vocalsound} to do for the research .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: And this was this LDA uh tuning perhaps and {vocalsound} Hynek proposed again to his uh TRAPS , so .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD C: Yeah ,\nProfessor A: I mean I g I guess the key thing for me is {disfmarker} is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides\nPhD C: um .\nProfessor A: cuz {disfmarker} because um\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: uh I was talking with Hynek about it later and the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} sort of had the sense sort of that {disfmarker} that neither group of people wanted to {disfmarker} to bother the other group too much . And {disfmarker} and I don't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things but I think that {vocalsound} you were sort of waiting for them to {vocalsound} tell you that they had something for you and {disfmarker} and that {disfmarker} and expected that they would do certain things and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: and {vocalsound} they were sort of waiting for you and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and uh we ended up with this thing where they {disfmarker} they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves , and they just had hadn't thought of that . So . Uh . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I mean it 's true that maybe {disfmarker} maybe no one really thought about that {disfmarker} that this latency thing would be such a {disfmarker} a strict issue\nPhD C: Yeah . Well , but . Yeah . Yeah . Well {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: in {disfmarker} in uh {disfmarker} the other {disfmarker}\nPhD C: Yeah I don't know what happened really , but\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: I guess it 's {disfmarker} it 's also so uh the time constraints . Because , {vocalsound} well , we discussed about that {disfmarker} about this problem and they told us \" well , we will do all that 's possible to have enough space for a network \" but then , yeah , perhaps they were too short with the time and\nProfessor A: Then they couldn't . I see .\nPhD C: uh yeah . But there was also problem {disfmarker} perhaps a problem of communication . So , yeah . Now we will try to {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: Just talk more .\nPhD C: Yeah , slikes and send mails .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: u s o o Yeah .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh . OK .\nProfessor A: So there 's um {disfmarker} Alright . Well maybe we should just uh I mean you 're {disfmarker} you 're bus other than that you folks are busy doing all the {disfmarker} all the things that you 're trying that we talked about before right ? And this {disfmarker} machines are busy and {vocalsound} you 're busy\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor A: and\nPhD C: Basically .\nProfessor A: Yeah . OK . Oh .\nPhD C: Um .\nProfessor A: Let 's {disfmarker} let 's , I mean , I think that as {disfmarker} as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that uh there {disfmarker} there will be {vocalsound} uh in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly uh uh do something about noise\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: in addition to the uh other things that we 're talking about and that 's probably the best thing to do . And there was that one email that said that {vocalsound} it sounded like uh uh things looked very promising up there in terms of uh I think they were using Ericsson 's {vocalsound} approach or something and {vocalsound} in addition to {disfmarker} They 're doing some noise removal thing , right ?\nPhD C: Yeah , yeah . So yeah we 're {disfmarker} will start to do this also .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD C: Uh so Carmen is just looking at the Ericsson {disfmarker} Ericsson code .\nPhD D: Yeah . We modif\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD C: And\nPhD D: Yeah , I modified it {disfmarker} well , modifying {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I studied Barry 's sim code , more or less . to take @ @ the first step the spectral subtraction . and we have some {disfmarker} the feature for Italian database and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD D: But we haven't result until this moment .\nProfessor A: Yeah , sure .\nPhD D: But well , we are working in this also\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD D: and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I don't {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's {disfmarker} it 's just that it 's in process or that you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it finished and it didn't get a good result ?\nPhD D: No . No , no n we have n we have do the experiment only have the feature {disfmarker} the feature but the experiment have\nPhD C: Yeah .\nPhD D: we have not make the experiment\nProfessor A: Oh . OK .\nPhD D: and maybe will be good result or bad result , we don't know .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah .\nPhD C: Yeah .\nProfessor A: OK . So um I suggest actually now we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we sorta move on and {disfmarker} and hear what 's {disfmarker} what 's {disfmarker} what 's happening in {disfmarker} in other areas like {vocalsound} what 's {disfmarker} what 's happening with your {vocalsound} investigations {vocalsound} about echos and so on .\nGrad F: Oh um Well um I haven't started writing the test yet , I 'm meeting with Adam today\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: um and he 's going t show me the scripts he has for um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: Uh {vocalsound} I also um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} haven't got the code yet , I haven't asked Hynek for {disfmarker} for the {disfmarker} for his code yet . Cuz I looked at uh Avendano 's thesis and {vocalsound} I don't really understand what he 's doing yet but it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it {disfmarker} it sounded like um {vocalsound} the channel normalization part {vocalsound} um of his thesis um {vocalsound} was done in a {disfmarker} a bit of I don't know what the word is , a {disfmarker} a bit of a rough way um {vocalsound} it sounded like he um he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it wasn't really fleshed out and maybe he did something that was {vocalsound} interesting for the test situation but I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure if it 's {vocalsound} what I 'd wanna use so I have to {disfmarker} I have to read it more , I don't really understand what he 's doing yet .\nProfessor A: OK . Yeah I haven't read it in a while so I 'm not gonna be too much help unless I read it again ,\nPhD D: It 's my\nPhD C: Oh yeah ?\nPhD D: I know this is mine here .\nProfessor A: so . OK . Um . {vocalsound} The um {disfmarker} so you , and then {vocalsound} you 're also gonna be doing this echo cancelling between the {disfmarker} the close mounted and the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} what we 're calling a cheating experiment uh of sorts between the distant {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Uh I I 'm ho Right . Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} or I 'm hoping {disfmarker} I 'm hoping Espen will do it .\nProfessor A: Ah ! OK .\nGrad F: Um\nProfessor A: F um\nGrad F: u\nProfessor A: Delegate . That 's good . It 's good to delegate .\nGrad F: I {disfmarker} I think he 's at least planning to do it for the cl close - mike cross - talk and so maybe I can just take whatever setup he has and use it .\nProfessor A: Great . Great . Yeah actually um he should uh I wonder who else is I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing uh a different cancellation . Um . {vocalsound} One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner {vocalsound} close - miked recordings . So uh this is especially true for the lapel but even for the close {disfmarker} close - miked uh cases um we 'd like to be able to have {vocalsound} um other sounds from other people and so forth removed from {disfmarker} So when someone isn't speaking you 'd like the part where they 're not speaking to actually be {disfmarker} So {vocalsound} what they 're talking about doing is using ec uh echo cancellation - like techniques . It 's not really echo but {vocalsound} uh just um uh taking the input from other mikes and using uh {vocalsound} uh a uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that uh other speech . So . Um what was it , there was {disfmarker} there was some {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some point where {vocalsound} eh uh Eric or somebody was {disfmarker} was speaking and he had lots of {vocalsound} silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else uh {vocalsound} which was in the background and it was not {disfmarker} it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech {vocalsound} on the close {disfmarker} {vocalsound} close mike .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPhD B: Oh the {disfmarker} What we talked about yesterday ?\nProfessor A: Yes .\nPhD B: Yeah that was actually my {disfmarker} I was wearing the {disfmarker} I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me ,\nProfessor A: Oh you {disfmarker} it was you I was Yeah .\nPhD B: and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . So they would like clean channels . Uh and for that {disfmarker} mmm uh {disfmarker} that purpose uh they 'd like to pull it out . So I think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to uh work on that . So . OK . Right ? Um . {vocalsound} And uh I don't know if we 've talked lately about the {disfmarker} the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning uh I don't remember if we talked about that last week or not , but {vocalsound} maybe just a quick reprise of {disfmarker} of what we were saying this morning .\nGrad E: OK .\nProfessor A: Uh .\nGrad E: Um . {comment} So continuing to um extend\nPhD B: What about the stuff that um Mirjam has been doing ? And {disfmarker} and S Shawn , yeah . Oh . So they 're training up nets to try to recognize these acoustic features ? I see .\nProfessor A: But that 's uh uh all {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} is a {disfmarker} a certainly relevant {comment} {vocalsound} uh study and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding . We have this problem with the overloading of the term \" feature \" so\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: uh {vocalsound} what are the variables , what we 're calling this one , what are the variables that they 're found {disfmarker} finding useful\nPhD C: Hmm .\nProfessor A: um for {disfmarker}\nPhD B: And their {disfmarker} their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features .\nProfessor A: Right . And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that but uh um so um So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying , do you ha still have that {disfmarker} ? Yeah .\nGrad E: Oh yeah .\nProfessor A: There 's those {vocalsound} {pause} that uh yeah , some of {disfmarker} some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on {disfmarker} on uh {vocalsound} what \" good features \" are and {disfmarker}\nPhD B: What does {disfmarker} what did um Larry Saul use for {disfmarker} it was the sonorant uh detector , right ? How did he {disfmarker} H how did he do that ? Wh - what was his detector ? Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Oh , OK . Mm - hmm . So how did he combine all these features ? What {disfmarker} what r mmm classifier did he Hmm . Oh right . You were talking about that , yeah . I see .\nProfessor A: And the other thing you were talking about is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is where we get the targets from . So I mean , there 's these issues of what are the {disfmarker} what are the variables that you use and do you combine them using the soft \" AND - OR \" or you do something , you know , more complicated um and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ? The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels {vocalsound} from somewhere and then uh doing the transformation . But then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why don't you tell us again about this {disfmarker} this database ? This is the {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Hmm !\nProfessor A: And then tell them to talk naturally ? Yeah , yeah .\nPhD B: Pierced tongues and Yeah . You could just mount it to that and they wouldn't even notice . Weld it . Zzz .\nProfessor A: Maybe you could go to these parlors and {disfmarker} and you could , you know {disfmarker} you know have {disfmarker} have , you know , reduced rates if you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if you can do the measurements .\nPhD B: Yeah . I That 's right . You could {disfmarker} what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know , transmitters in them and things\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah , be cool and help science .\nPhD B: and Yeah .\nProfessor A: OK .\nPhD B: Hmm ! There 's a bunch of data that l around , that {disfmarker} people have done studies like that w way way back right ? I mean {vocalsound} I can't remember where {disfmarker} uh Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of {disfmarker} Yeah . I remember there was this guy at A T - andT , Randolph ? or r What was his name ? Do you remember that guy ? Um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features . I can't remember what his name was . Dang . Now I 'll think of it . That 's interesting .\nProfessor A: Do you mean eh {disfmarker} but you {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker} Mar\nPhD C: Well he was the guy {disfmarker} the guy that was using {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: you mean when was {disfmarker} was Mark Randolph there , or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD B: Mark Randolph .\nProfessor A: Yeah he 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker} he 's at Motorola now .\nPhD B: Oh is he ?\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Oh OK .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD C: Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD B: I can't remember exactly what he was using , now . But I know {disfmarker} I just remember it had to do with you know {vocalsound} uh positional parameters\nPhD C: What {disfmarker} Yeah .\nPhD B: and trying to m you know do speech recognition based on them .\nPhD C: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Yeah . So the only {disfmarker} the only uh hesitation I had about it since , I mean I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's {disfmarker} it 's {vocalsound} continuous variables and a bunch of them . And so\nPhD B: Hmm .\nProfessor A: I don't know how complicated it is to go from there {disfmarker} What you really want are these binary {pause} labels , and just a few of them . And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it and it 's e but it {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , whereas um {vocalsound} if you did something instead that {disfmarker} like um having some manual annotation by {vocalsound} uh you know , linguistics students , this would {disfmarker} there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with {disfmarker} with John before\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: And then there would {disfmarker} it would really be uh this uh uh binary variable . Course then , that 's the other question is do you want binary variables . So . I mean the other thing you could do is {vocalsound} boot trying to {disfmarker} to uh get those binary variables and take the continuous variables from {vocalsound} uh the uh {vocalsound} uh the data itself there , but I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Could you cluster the {disfmarker} just do some kind of clustering ?\nProfessor A: Guess you could , yeah .\nPhD B: Bin them up into different categories and {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: Yeah . So anyway that 's {disfmarker} that 's uh {disfmarker} that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at . Um . {vocalsound} Um . {vocalsound} I mean in general it 's gonna be {disfmarker} for new data that you look at , it 's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to {vocalsound} wear the pellets and {disfmarker} Um . So .\nGrad E: Right . Right .\nPhD B: So you 're talking about using that data to get uh instead of using canonical mappings of phones .\nGrad E: Right .\nPhD B: So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the true mappings are for each phone ?\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: I see .\nGrad E: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Yeah . So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in {disfmarker} in my mind , I guess , is that um {vocalsound} we 're looking at different ways that we can combine {vocalsound} uh different kinds of {disfmarker} of rep front - end representations {vocalsound} um in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions . And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from {vocalsound} uh multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have {vocalsound} a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} one um articulatory feature . The question is is can we learn from that {vocalsound} to change some of the other methods we have , since {disfmarker} I mean , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that {disfmarker} that it {disfmarker} it um {disfmarker} the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on uh a {disfmarker} a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than {vocalsound} um just assuming {vocalsound} that you should train e e every detector uh with equal strength {vocalsound} towards uh it being this phone or that phone . Right ? So it {disfmarker} so um {vocalsound} he 's got these um uh uh\nPhD B: Hmm .\nProfessor A: he \" AND 's \" between these different {vocalsound} features . It 's a soft \" AND \" , I guess but in {disfmarker} in principle {vocalsound} you {disfmarker} you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR 's \" across the different {disfmarker} soft \" OR 's \" across the different uh {vocalsound} multi - band channels . And um {vocalsound} the weight yeah , the target for the training of the \" AND \" {disfmarker} \" AND ' ed \" things {vocalsound} is something that 's kept {vocalsound} uh as a hidden variable , and is learned with EM . Whereas what we were doing is {disfmarker} is uh {vocalsound} taking {vocalsound} the phone target and then just back propagating from that\nPhD B: So he doesn't have {disfmarker}\nProfessor A: which means that it 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's uh i It could be for instance {vocalsound} that for a particular point in the data {vocalsound} you don't want to um uh train a particular band {disfmarker} train the detectors for a particular band . You {disfmarker} you wanna ignore {vocalsound} that band , cuz that 's a {disfmarker} Ban - band is a noisy {disfmarker} noisy measure .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: And we don't {disfmarker} We 're {disfmarker} we 're still gonna try to train it up . In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well {disfmarker} well as it can at predicting . Uh . Maybe that 's not the right thing to do .\nPhD B: So he doesn't have to have truth marks or {disfmarker} Ho\nGrad E: F right , and uh he doesn't have to have hard labels .\nProfessor A: Well at the {disfmarker} at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's {disfmarker} where it 's sonorant . But he 's {disfmarker} but what he 's - but what he 's not training up {disfmarker} uh what he doesn't depend on as truth is\nGrad E: Right . For the full band .\nProfessor A: um I guess one way of describing would be if {disfmarker} if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ? Is it sonorant in that band ?\nGrad E: Right .\nProfessor A: Is it sonorant in that band ? i It 's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant . So\nPhD B: Mm - hmm . OK .\nProfessor A: then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band {vocalsound} towards making your decision . And um {vocalsound} uh we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should {disfmarker} you should use everything {vocalsound} uh with {disfmarker} with uh equal strength .\nPhD B: I see .\nProfessor A: And uh because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities , if we had {vocalsound} uh enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the {disfmarker} if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can . But um this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from {disfmarker} from the beginning and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the {disfmarker}\nPhD B: So where did he get his {disfmarker} uh his tar his uh high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ?\nGrad E: From uh canonical mappings {comment} um at first\nPhD B: OK .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nGrad E: and then it 's unclear um eh\nPhD B: Using TIMIT ? or using {disfmarker}\nGrad E: using TIMIT\nPhD B: Uh - huh .\nGrad E: right , right .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nGrad E: And then uh he does some fine tuning um for um special cases . Yeah .\nProfessor A: Yeah . I mean we ha we have a kind of {vocalsound} iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi , uh so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data but it 's {disfmarker} it 's not {disfmarker} I think it s doesn't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this {disfmarker} cuz then whatever {vocalsound} that alignment is , it 's that for all {disfmarker} all bands .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate {disfmarker} tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did . Um . But it 's still {vocalsound} not quite the same because then it 's {disfmarker} it 's um setting targets based on where you would say {vocalsound} the sound begins in a particular band . Where he 's s this is not a labeling per se . Might be closer I guess if we did a {vocalsound} soft {disfmarker} soft target uh {vocalsound} uh embedded {vocalsound} neural net training like we 've done a few times uh {vocalsound} f the forward um {disfmarker} do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those . Mmm . Uh what 's next ?\nPhD B: I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with .\nProfessor A: Oh . You 're playing ?\nPhD B: I um Huh ?\nProfessor A: You 're playing ?\nPhD B: Yes , I 'm playing . Um {vocalsound} so I wanted to do this experiment to see um {vocalsound} uh what happens if we try to uh improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things . And so I had this um {disfmarker} I think I sent around last week a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} this plan I had for an experiment , this matrix where {vocalsound} I would take the um {disfmarker} the original um the original system . So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then uh optimize the b HTK system and run that again . So look at the difference there and then uh do the same thing for {vocalsound} the ICSI - OGI front - end .\nProfessor A: What {disfmarker} which test set was this ?\nPhD B: This is {disfmarker} that I looked at ?\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: Uh I 'm looking at the Italian right now .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So as far as I 've gotten is I 've uh {vocalsound} been able to go through from beginning to end the um full HTK {vocalsound} system for the Italian data and got the same results that um {disfmarker} that uh {vocalsound} Stephane had . So um I started looking {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} and now I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to {disfmarker} uh to improve it . So . One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use {vocalsound} the same number of states for all of the models\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and so I went on - line and I uh found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits . Um you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a {disfmarker} an HMM system is that you use {vocalsound} um three states per phone and um {vocalsound} so then the {disfmarker} the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Um . {vocalsound} Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use {vocalsound} uh models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . They 've got those initial and final null states . And so um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five {vocalsound} which um , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: And so they had sixteen . So that 's pretty close . Um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} but for the {disfmarker} most of the words are sh much shorter . So the majority of them wanna have nine states . And so theirs are s sort of twice as long . So {vocalsound} my guess {disfmarker} uh And then if you {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I printed out a confusion matrix um {vocalsound} uh for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that {vocalsound} you know , if you assume a fixed {disfmarker} the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really um have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh you 've got {disfmarker} you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So {vocalsound} it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's {disfmarker} because you have so many states , you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . So um I 'm going to try to um create more word - specific {vocalsound} um uh prototype H M Ms to start training from .\nProfessor A: Yeah , I mean , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the {disfmarker} for the longer word ,\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: but .\nPhD B: Yeah so I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just um you know create {vocalsound} uh models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: And as part of that um I wanted to see sort of how the um {disfmarker} how these models were coming out , you know , what w {vocalsound} when we train up uh th you know , the model for \" one \" , which wants to have nine states , you know , what is the {disfmarker} uh what do the transition probabilities look like {disfmarker} in the self - loops , {comment} look like in {disfmarker} in those models ? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can {vocalsound} calculate the expected duration of an HMM just by looking at the transition matrix\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: you know , the long ones versus the short ones . I d I did {disfmarker} quickly , I did the silence model and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and um that 's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the {vocalsound} string of digits .\nProfessor A: Wow . Lots of silence .\nPhD B: Yeah , yeah . And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I {disfmarker} I haven't calculated that for that one yet , but um . So they basically {disfmarker} their {disfmarker} {vocalsound} their model for a whole digit string is silence {vocalsound} digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end . And so .\nProfessor A: Are the SP 's optional ? I mean skip them ?\nPhD B: I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are . Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's {disfmarker} it 's not gonna hurt a whole lot\nProfessor A: I see .\nPhD B: and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own {disfmarker} um It doesn't require its own training data ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: it just shares that state .\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So it , I mean , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , but um i So I wanna play with that a little bit more . I 'm curious about looking at , you know {vocalsound} how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wanna compare that in the {disfmarker} the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of {disfmarker} just from looking at the {vocalsound} durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening .\nProfessor A: Yeah , I mean , I think that uh , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: The premise is kind of you have a {disfmarker} a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ?\nPhD B: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: And uh\nPhD B: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th um {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . So they 're fairly , you know , hefty models . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , {vocalsound} you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . So in fact what we may want are simpler models .\nProfessor A: Could be .\nPhD B: And compare how they perform to that . But {vocalsound} you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have .\nProfessor A: Right . And that , I mean , at the moment that 's not the limitation , so .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: I mean , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was um where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . You know , so .\nPhD B: Yeah . Right .\nProfessor A: Uh {vocalsound} that 's another parameter , right ? that {disfmarker} that maybe , you know , uh {disfmarker} you really want three or nine or {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing {disfmarker} I mean , if I {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if I start um reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models {vocalsound} that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians .\nProfessor A: Right .\nPhD B: So in a sense it 'll be a simpler system .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . But I think right now again the idea is doing just very simple things\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor A: how much better can you make it ? And um since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: um so\nPhD B: Right . Right .\nProfessor A: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor A: Doesn't have to go down .\nPhD B: Yeah . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet ,\nProfessor A: Mm - hmm , OK .\nPhD B: I was just gonna change the {disfmarker} the t\nProfessor A: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah .\nPhD B: yeah , just look at the length of the models and just see what happens .\nProfessor A: Yeah .\nPhD B: So .\nProfessor A: Cool . OK . So uh {vocalsound} what 's uh I guess your plan for {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you guys ' plan for the next {disfmarker} next week is {vocalsound} just continue on these {disfmarker} these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and\nPhD C: Yeah , I guess we can try to {vocalsound} have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . with all these minor things {vocalsound} {vocalsound} modified . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and {vocalsound} retry the MSG and things like that .\nProfessor A: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah we {disfmarker} we have a big list .\nPhD C: Big list ?\nProfessor A: You have a big list of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of things to do . So . Well that 's good . I think {vocalsound} that after all of this uh um confusion settles down in another {disfmarker} some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and {vocalsound} hopefully it 'll have some effect from something {vocalsound} that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that has uh been done by our group of people but uh e even if it doesn't there 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} there 's go there 'll be standards after that . So .\nPhD B: Does anybody know how to um {vocalsound} run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it {vocalsound} s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ?\nGrad E: I {disfmarker} I think uh Mike tried it\nPhD B: Yeah ?\nGrad E: and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave .\nPhD B: Octave .\nGrad E: Octave is the um UNIX clone of {disfmarker} of Matlab which you can batch .\nPhD B: Ah ! OK . Great . Thanks .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD B: I was going crazy trying to do that .\nProfessor A: Huh .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD C: What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ?\nGrad E: What 's that ? Uh , Octave ?\nPhD C: Yeah .\nGrad E: Yeah it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's free . I think we have it here {comment} r running somewhere .\nPhD B: Great !\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD C: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad E: Um {vocalsound} {comment} i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that {comment} Matlab went to these like um you can have cells and you can {disfmarker} you can {comment} uh implement object - oriented type things with Matlab . Uh Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab um four point something or .\nPhD B: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff\nGrad E: The basic stuff , right .\nPhD B: that 's perfect .\nGrad E: Yeah .\nPhD B: Great !\nProfessor A: OK , guess we 're done .\nGrad E: OK .\nGrad F: Well , although by the way .\n\nNow, answer the query based on the above meeting transcript in one or more sentences.\n\nQuery: Summarize the meeting\nAnswer:", "summary_gt": "", "input_tokens": 8222, "output_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 8222, "source_file": "qmsum.jsonl"}
{"article": "Here are 30 paragraphs from Wikipedia, along with an abstract. Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: A wrench in International Broadcasting's application was a concurring proposed merger between Shreveport's two major daily newspapers, the Shreveport Times and the Shreveport Journal. On December 4, 1953, the FCC Broadcast Bureau reversed a hearing examiner's decision and approved KTBS Inc.'s request to subpoena International Broadcasting/KWKH for a \"merger\" agreement between the Times and the Journal, contending that the testimony of KWKH president William H. Bronson in respect to the agreement alone was insufficient and that the agreement be submitted for review in judging the KWKH application. KTBS Inc. respesentatives contended the agreement was relevant \"because the [Times Publishing Company and the Journal Publishing Company, the newspapers' respective owners] publish the only major newspapers in Shreveport\" and because Times Publishing would be the business agent for both newspapers and exert control of KWKH. On June 16, 1954, FCC Hearing Examiner Basil Cooper issued an initial decision looking to grant the construction permit application for channel 3 to KTBS Inc. The FCC Broadcast Bureau granted exclusive rights to the permit to Shreveport Television Company on February 16, 1955, formally denying KRMD and Southland Television's respective bids, finding that KTBS Inc. was a more qualified permittee due to its local ownership, integration of ownership and management, and had more extensive participation by its ownership in local affairs.\n\nParagraph 2: Since the early 20th century, most accounts of archaeological methodology have accepted the data that is uncovered by the archaeologist is subsequently interpreted through a theoretical viewpoint. Nevertheless, the archaeological community is divided over the extent to which theory pervades the discipline. On one side, there are those who believe that certain archaeological techniques – such as excavation or recording – are neutral and outside of the bounds of theory, while on the other are those who believe that these too are also influenced by theoretical considerations. Archaeologist Ian Hodder, a prominent advocate of the latter view, criticised the alternate approach by highlighting that methodological decisions, such as where to open a trench, how diligently to excavate a stratigraphic layer and whether to keep every artefact discovered, are all based on prior theoretical interpretations of the site, and that even excavatory techniques could not therefore escape the realm of theory. Those who take the former approach have sometimes tried to separate the raw data from the theoretical interpretations in their publications, but have come under criticism from those, such as Hodder, who argue that theoretical interpretation pervades the entire archaeological methodology, and therefore cannot be separated from the raw data.\n\nParagraph 3: Elton's early career was influenced by Alexander Carr-Saunders, Victor Ernest Shelford and Gordon Hewitt. In 1922 Alexander Carr-Saunders wrote The Population Problem: A Study of Human Evolution, where he outlines how the influence of overpopulation in humans has cascading effects on plant and animal life around the world. Elton later applied these ideas of fluctuation to animals. Victor Ernest Shelford wrote Animal Communities in Temperate America in 1913, where he outlines three main principles of ecology: (1) emphasis on the importance of studying the physiology of the organism, rather than the physiology of a specific organ; (2) evaluation of the \"phenomena of behaviour and physiology\" in relation to the natural environments; and (3) relation of the ecology of plant life to that of animal life. In Gordon Hewitt's 1921 book The Conservation of the Wildlife of Canada, Elton noticed the Canadian lynx and snowshoe hare population cycles, and developed greater understanding of population fluctuations in Arctic vertebrates with the Hudson's Bay Company.\n\nParagraph 4: By the mid-1980s, Zerby began to issue religious edicts of her own: following allegations of sexual abuse within the organization, she forbade sexual activity in 1984 for new members until they had been in the group for six months and in that same year began the taping of cassettes with music, which provided an additional source of income. In 1986, she forbade sexual contact between adults and minors; later, it became an offense that could lead to excommunication. Throughout the 1980s, she dictated and enforced elements of discipline, ending, for instance, a training program for children she deemed too harsh. With David Berg's health declining in the late 1980s, Zerby essentially took over the leadership position in 1988. After Berg's death in 1994, she married Steven Kelly, another group leader, and assumed the spiritual leadership of the group.\n\nParagraph 5: The operation started on the evening of 1 April with engagement to start shortly after midnight. The lagoon crossing (marked in advance though not too successfully by Combined Operations Pilotage Party 2 and M Squadron, Special Boat Service), took far longer than planned due to the exceptionally low water level and exceptionally muddy lagoon bottom, which was as deep as chest high. The Commandos struggled through the muddy waste all night, manhandling their boats, and eventually reached the Spit at first light, over 4 hours behind schedule. Exhausted and covered in glutinous slime they pressed home their attacks. Nos. 2, 40 and 43 Commandos all made their objectives relatively as expected although the Germans succeeded in blowing-up one bridge before it was captured by No.2 Commando. No. 9 Commando initially made good progress until No. 5 and No. 6 Troops (especially 5 Troop), became seriously pinned down across a killing ground while attempting to capture the enemy position 'Leviticus', (all physical references were given biblical names in this operation). 1 and 2 Troops made good progress down the centre of the Spit and when advised of the situation of 5 and 6 Troops, bypassed Leviticus in order to turn about. They laid smoke, and conducted a bayonet charge, from the southeast. The German position was overrun despite the smoke clearing too quickly exposing the Commandos during the last 150 metres. Routed German defenders who had fled north, fell into the waiting Bren guns of 6 Troop. The bayonet charge was accompanied by 1 Troop’s piper playing ’The Road to the Isles’.\n\nParagraph 6: In 2005, the Standards in Public Office Commission received a complaint regarding an advertisement for the Operation Freeflow system which outlined traffic and travel arrangements in Dublin in the pre-Christmas period, and which featured a photograph of Callely, then Minister of State. The complainant was of the view that the Minister's appearance in the advertisement was a direct contravention of section 2.2.3 of the Code of Conduct for Office Holders as outlined above. The Standards Commission wrote to the complainant advising that they did not consider that the inclusion of a photograph of an office holder in an advertisement relating to a matter which encompassed his functions as an office holder was necessarily inappropriate. However, it also considered that the provisions of the code were insufficiently clear so as to distinguish between the appropriate use of a photograph of an office holder as part of a necessary advertising campaign and an inappropriate raising of profile in the context of a general election. The Standards Commission wrote to the Taoiseach and requested that the provisions of section 2.2.3 of the Code of Conduct for office holders be reviewed in order that office holders are provided with clear guidelines as to the circumstances in which public resources can be used in a way which avoids the inappropriate raising of profile in the context of a general election.\n\nParagraph 7: The ideal-type method developed by Max Weber is a useful tool in contemporary public administration theory development because the method takes into account the culture of a society that is then integrated into a theory. Weber referred to it as cultural science or interpretive sociology, which, is to understand ideas and practices from within their own intellectual and cultural horizon and on the basis of categories that are grounded in a meaningful social and historical context. According to Margaret Stout, Ideal-type methods are used to frame observation and analysis and to evaluate what is found. Weber's method must be developed using value judgments that direct our empirical observations and then guide our interpretation of those observations. Through this theory building method, Weber insisted that all interpretations of meaning must remain at best \"a peculiarly plausible hypothesis\", as opposed to a claim of relevance of a theory. Weber's purpose for using this method is to clarify the importance of values in sense making, but how they are also extremely important for the conduct of meaningful social science. Weber’s interpretive sociology employs a type of functional analysis that begins with the whole, proceeds to the parts, and then goes back from the parts to the whole. His ideal-type method is thereby simultaneously useful in both the study of social structure and social action. Social action is linked to subjective meaning at the individual level of analysis, and structural forms are a consequence or construction of social action. This combination is particularly valuable to public administration because the manner in which administrative action and the social structures of governance interrelate requires an approach that considers both. On the one hand, ideal-types enable consideration of things like alternative meanings of important concepts or alternative motivations held by social actors. On the other hand, they enable analysis of associated or resulting social structures. In this way, an ideal-type can concurrently help interpret the meaning of the administrative role as well as critique the institutions of governance.\n\nParagraph 8: Under NCLB, school success and failure is linked to performance on standardized tests. However, this measure subjects English Language Learners (ELLs) \"to critical assessments without adequate preparation.\" The lack of preparation is due to the fact that NCLB caps funding for bilingual education programs at half of what it had been and does not require that any bilingual education programs undergo periodic evaluation, a measure required by the Casteñada v. Pickard court case. And yet, despite this lack of preparation, ELLs performance on standardized tests can jeopardize a school's access to funding. In essence, \"This turns the question of whether or not a school receives a failing label into a question of how many ELLs attend.\" Because the impact of NCLB on ELLs has significant implications on ELLs and their communities' access to education, NCLB is in conflict with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in that it denies \"access to a federally funded program based on their skin color or race.\" The changes in the BEA under NCLB created a grant program that attempted to enhance English language acquisition. The ruling placed ELL students in a similar classroom environment as their peers for whom English is not a second language. The law did not require schools to provide bilingual programs and placed them against the rigorous content standards put in place by State Education Agencies. When ELLs were tested with the same state assessments or the National Assessment for Educational Progress (NAEP), it was shown that compared to their fluently English-speaking peers the ELL students displayed larger deficits in both reading and math. The 2007 NAEP test, showed increased deficits in both math and reading following a surge of the ELL population in the United States. By 2005 the number of English-learners throughout the US had risen 57% over the prior decade to approximately 5.1 million students.\n\nParagraph 9: Vivas served as the head coach of the Fresno State women's volleyball team from 1991 to 2004, becoming the school's all-time winningest coach in that sport in the process.  Vivas today remains the winningest coach in Fresno State women's volleyball history with a 263-167 overall record and .612 overall winning percentage.  In eight of her 14 seasons at Fresno State, her teams won more than 20 games, including 24 wins during the 1997 campaign.  Six times, her teams finished in the top three of the Western Athletic Conference standings, and three times she was named the WAC Coach of the Year.  Vivas lead Fresno State to the school's best single-season winning percentage of .767 during the 2002 season when the Bulldogs finished 23-7 overall.  Three times under her leadership, Fresno State reached the NCAA Tournament (1991, 1998, 2002) and three times (1992, 1994, 1995) the Bulldogs reached the National Invitational Volleyball Championship (NIVC) in Kansas City, Mo.  Three times under Vivas, the Bulldogs reached the American Volleyball Coaches Association Top 25 national poll.  On November 9, 2003, the Bulldogs' home match versus the University of Hawaii drew 4,708 fans—a new school record—shattering the previous mark of 1,982 fans versus UH on Nov. 23, 1996.  That crowd of 4,708 remains the largest home crowd in Fresno State volleyball history through the 2008 season.  On December 6, 2004, Vivas was fired from the Fresno State head coaching position amid Title IX problems. Vivas filed with the U.S. Department of Education Office over alleged gender based discrimination related to the firing and sued the university.  Following a court trial, on July 9, 2007, a jury of her peers agreed unanimously with Vivas, and she was awarded $5.85 million for back pay and expenses.\n\nParagraph 10: Raised in Birmingham, Alabama, Worthington played baseball at the University of Alabama before becoming a professional. Acquired by the Giants in 1953, he began his career with the ballclub as a starter, pitching two shutouts in his first two major league games. After spending most of 1954 and all of 1955 in the minor leagues, he became a full-time starter again in 1956. During 1957–58, he split his time between the rotation and the bullpen, and by 1959 he was almost exclusively used as a relief pitcher. He split 1960 between the Red Sox, the minor leagues, and the White Sox, retiring with about a month left in the season because the White Sox were engaged in ruses to steal opposing team's signs, and he could not play for the team with a clear conscience. He completed his degree at Howard College, then decided to return to baseball and spent two years in the minor leagues for the White Sox. The Reds acquired him in 1963, and Worthington posted a 2.99 earned run average (ERA) out of the bullpen for them that year. He began 1964 with Cincinnati, was sent to the minor leagues, and had his contract purchased by the Twins, whom he would spend the rest of his career with. Sports Illustrated called his 1.37 ERA with the team that year \"impressive.\" In 1965, Worthington had a career-high 21 saves and a career-low 2.13 ERA, also winning 10 games. From 1966 to 1967 he saved 32 games, and in 1968 he led American League (AL) relievers with 18 saves. In a 14-year career, Worthington compiled a 75–82 record with 834 strikeouts, a 3.39 ERA, and 110 saves in  innings pitched.\n\nParagraph 11: Fernandez insisted on a rematch, but Ring Magazine writer Al Buck pointed to Fernandez's two fights with Rocky Kalingo as a reason why Fullmer would be foolish to fight Fernandez in Communist Cuba; \" Fighting Fernandez in Cuba hardly would be an enjoyable experience except for another Cuban, a Russian, or a Red Chinese. A Fernandez-Yankee battle in Havana would be put in a military atmosphere and amid turmoil. It was recalled that one Rocky Kalingo knocked out Fernandez in one round in Caracas and then let the Cuban have a return fight in Havana. Kalingo knocked Fernandez down in the first and appeared to be headed for another victory. The mob wouldn't have it. Kalingo was threatened to the point at which he was scared into near-paralysis. He was stopped.\"\n\nParagraph 12: Some signs of this English presence have vanished, like the small dell in the cemetery where there were once some hundred graves. Some of these, such as those of Lord Arthur Somerset or Richard John Meade, bore testimony to the aristocratic nature of the community. Other vestiges remain, like the fountain near the new public library in a square shaded by a plane tree. The inscription reads: \"In loving memory of Marianne Stewart who died on 18 August 1900. She laboured many years in the cause of mercy to animals. Her last wish was that a drinking fountain should be set up for them in Hyères\".\n\nParagraph 13: In August 2017 the 15th anniversary of the Rouge was intensely celebrated by the fans and all the former members. The following month, the official profile of the \"Tea House of Alice\", show published a pink banner with the words: \"If alone they already cause, imagine together.\" The image caused an uproar among fans, who began speculating that the group might be the theme of one of the parties. On September 12, the profile released a pink and glittery image, alluding to the cover of the first album and promising an official statement the next day. The show not only marks the 15 years of the group, but also the return of Luciana Andrade. On September 13 was announced the return of the group with the original formation on October 13. On September 14, tickets were put up for sale and sold out in a minute. But as there were problems with some purchases, it was still possible to get some tickets. After three hours, the organization of the event announced that the five thousand tickets had been exhausted and an extra show was scheduled for the following day. The show reverberated and was so intense that the group decided to announce a new tour of the main capitals of Brazil in 2018. And on October 15, one day after the second session of the Tea Rouge in Rio de Janeiro, Karin Hills announced in his Instagram teaser of #RougeDoc, documentary containing the backstage of the show. On October 26, sales for the São Paulo show began on November 25, and just as in Rio, the 7,000 tickets offered for sale sold out in just over 3 hours. The site responsible for the purchase of the tickets did not withstand such high demand and remained out of the air for a few minutes. According to the company responsible, about 240,000 people accessed the site at the same time. The virtual queue has reached almost 20,000 people. Which caused a great inconvenience with the public. A new extra show was scheduled for December 2, and was sold out the same day. In October 2017, it was confirmed that Rouge had returned definitively.  On November 29, the group signed again with Sony Music Brasil and on December 1, 2017 their complete discography was made available for sale and streaming on digital platforms. After the digital release, the four albums reached the Top 10 of the Brazilian iTunes charts, seven songs being in the Top 100 singles, in addition to seven songs entering Brazil's Spotify Top 200.\n\nParagraph 14: In joint work with Giovanni Peri, Ottaviano investigated the relationship between linguistic diversity across U.S. cities and local productivity over 1970–90; together, they find that wages and employment density of U.S.-born workers were systematically higher, all else equal, in cities with higher linguistic diversity, especially for highly educated and for white workers, and that the relationship was strengthened the better non-native speakers were assimilated in terms of language skills and duration of residence. Further research by Ottaviano and Peri on the value of cultural diversity - as proxied by the diversity of countries of birth of U.S. residents - suggested that US-born citizens living in metropolitan areas with increasing shares of foreign-born residents experienced significant growth in wages and housing values. Their thinking about the effects of immigration on natives' wages turns around the notion that natives and foreigners are inherently imperfectly substitutable even within the same skill group. Using this framework, they showed that immigration to the U.S. in 1990-2006 had small negative short-run effects on native high school dropouts (-0.7%) and average wages (-0.4%), while raising the wages of native high school dropouts and average native wages in the long run by 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively, but depressing the long-run wages of previous immigrants by 6.7%. Another study by Ottaviano with Peri and Greg Wright observed that manufacturing industries with a larger increase in exposure to globalization (through offshoring or immigration) saw improvements in terms of native employment growth relative to less exposed industries. They explain this finding through a model wherein natives, immigrants and offshore workers differ systematically in their ability to apply complex skills and wherein jobs vary in the degree to which their performance requires complex skills. In this framework, the productivity effect related to more efficient task assignment - producers hiring natives, immigrants and offshore workers for different tasks according to their respective comparative advantage - may offset the displacement effect of immigration and offshoring on natives' employment. Finally, with regard to the labour market effects of immigration to Western Germany during the 1990s, Ottaviano - together with Peri and Francesco d'Amuri - found that immigration had a sizeable adverse effect on previous immigrants' employment and a small adverse effect on their wages, while having very little adverse effects on native wages and employments; the authors explain this divergence through the higher substitutability between different groups of immigrants relative to that between immigrants and natives.\n\nParagraph 15: After his discharge from the Army, Shawcross moved with Linda from Oklahoma to Clayton, New York. Linda would soon divorce him, after which he began committing crimes such as arson and burglary. Shawcross's offenses earned him a five-year sentence at Attica Correctional Facility, and later Auburn Correctional Facility. After serving 22 months, he was granted an early release in October 1971, in part due to his role in the rescue of a correctional officer during a prison riot. Shawcross returned to his hometown of Watertown, New York, eventually getting a job with the Watertown Public Works Department and marrying for the third time.\n\nParagraph 16: It was a sister station to CIHF-TV-2 in Saint John. Both stations were branded as MITV (Maritimes Independent Television), and their schedules were almost identical. However, the stations offered separate newscasts to their respective provinces and opportunities for advertisers to buy ad space on one or both stations. Furthermore, although the Saint John station's callsign made it appear that it was a rebroadcaster of the Halifax station, both stations were separately licensed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). At the time, MITV was the only over-the-air independent television station in the area, with studios and main operation centre in Halifax, and all other functions in Saint John. As MITV shared owners with CHSJ-TV, a popular joke in the Maritimes was that MITV stood for \"More Irving Television\".\n\nParagraph 17: Over the past 18 years, Tourettes has changed venues repeatedly, moving to Oakland where it started at The Stork Club, then finding its current home where \"every month, throngs of fans descend upon the Oakland Metro Operahouse, a chilly warehouse with mottled, tar-spattered cement floors, to witness one of Oakland's strangest attractions. Tourettes Without Regrets is a raunchy, attention-deficit vaudeville extravaganza.\" The show \"combines variety show with game show for a balanced and rhythmic flow of high-energy scenes: the slam judges introduced themselves by mimicking psychotic animals; two previous \"dirty haiku\" champions faced off in three rounds; a sick beatboxing duo gave a perfectly timed set; a surreal burlesque/performance group combined a flute, some high-flown language, and a Snow White strip-tease, etc.\" Called \"one of the wildest and most creatively raw variety shows in the Bay Area\" by SF Weekly, the show has spawned a series of spinoff events, such as the annual Game of Thrones Show, where \"the crowd is segregated into Starks and Lannisters and crazed interactive games ensue. You help kill off favorite characters and rewrite the ending of the show yourself.\" The show includes \"a local \"choose your own adventure\" band whose live show involves twelve-sided dice the size of beach balls. As per the night's theme, the group will perform new material inspired by Game of Thrones.\" The Holy Sh*t Show, lampoons Scientology, and the yearly XXX Show, started in 2012 at the Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell Theater. In DeWolf's own words about Tourettes, \"If you've never been to a rap battle, if you've never been to a poetry slam, if you've never seen burlesque, if you've never seen stand-up comedy, or dirty haiku, or freakish, inventive contests—then that's what the show is for, to put all of those elements into one show. What makes 'Tourettes' individual and unique is throwing all of these elements together and seeing what happens.\" \"It's Psychotic vaudeville. It's taking highbrow and lowbrow and making them collide in this demolition derby.\" The show has won \"The Best of the Bay\" multiple times from The East Bay Express, SF Weekly, and the San Francisco Guardian since its inception.\n\nParagraph 18: Coming from the Olympic disappointment, Stekic again had very successful season in 1977, recording his best long-jump of the year of 8.27 m to again top the rest of the world. He won the gold medal at the World Student Games at Sofia and again produced many long-jumps over 8 m, winning the Yugoslav Championships with a leap of 8.14 m. Stekic was chosen to represent Europe at the first World Cup held in Düsseldorf, but there he again showed inconsistency when he reached modest 7.79 m to place him 4th. Stekic topped the world for the third time in previous four years in 1978 when he recorded the long-jump of 8.32 m on 16 September at Rovereto. If he produced it one week earlier, he would be a European champion, but in the long-jump final at the continental Champs in Prague, Stekic managed to jump 8.12 m to earn another silver medal, 6 cm behind the gold medalist, Jaques Rousseau (France). He competed at similar level in 1979 and produced 4th best long-jump of the year when winning his fifth Balkan title at the Games in Athens. Stekic also successfully retained his Mediterranean title when winning on home soil at Split in a championship record of 8.21 m. In his preparation for the 1980 Olympic Games at Moscow, Stekic won his only medal (silver) at the European Indoor Championships at Sindelfingen and his sixth and final gold at the Balkan Games at Sofia with his season's best of 8.11 m. Sadly, Stekic injured himself in his very first jump in qualifying round at the Olympics, but continued to compete for a decade after that despite far from the form from the '70s. He finished 5th at the 1982 European Championships in Athens and had rather solid season in 1983, winning the European B Cup at Prague with 8.04 m and finishing creditable 5th at the inaugural World Championships at Helsinki with a leap of 8.09 m. He did not qualify for another Olympic final in 1984, and won his final Yugoslav title in 1985. Stekic did not compete at the 1986 European Championships in Stuttgart despite producing season's best of 8.19 m and then competed only sparingly until 1991. In the late '80s, Stekić amassed the most jumps over the 8 m mark (later surpassed by Larry Myricks). He is one of the most decorated athletes from former Yugoslavia.\n\nParagraph 19: In 1881 at 41 years of age William Aplin returned to his rural roots and purchased the huge Southwick pastoral station of . It was advertised as:\"Southwick and Reedy Lake Stations, 100 miles west of Townsville in the North Kennedy District containing 422 sq miles of splendid basaltic country permanently watered by frontage of 35 miles to Fletchers Creek, 35 miles to Allingham Creek and 15 miles to Burdekin River, together with 7,000 breeding cattle, amongst them a stud herd of 300. There is a good home station with a paddock of 2,000 acres besides 2 out-stations with sets of yards, 50 horses and station plant given in.\"The property was described by a station manager in the late 1860s as:a rough life, with fever, blight and the constant danger from blacks who infested the 'Basalt Wall', a peculiar formation running for miles parallel with two running creeks, the Fletcher and Sandy, both of which abounded in fish. The Wall was a veritable stronghold for the blacks, who realising the security it was, were very bold and daring. During my stay on 'Reedy Lake' station, I had one of my shepherds killed and lost a number of sheep, many of which were driven away in mobs of 50 at a time. I can safely say that life was never safe and the wise thing to do on seeing a black, was to shoot and shoot straight, otherwise he would certainly spear you. I had several narrow escapes.\"William Aplin managed a large Aboriginal camp on Southwick and employed many of them as stockmen and some of the women as housemaids. After his death, under the Protection of Aboriginals Act 1897 the Government  established Southwick Reserve, comprising  there in 1901. Aplin raised fine herds of Shorthorn cattle, up to 15,000 head and improved the breed by using his stud Shorthorn bulls. The cattle would roam wild over unfenced Southwick land and across adjacent properties. They were mustered in their hundreds on boundary camps where the cattle were drafted (known colloquially as cut out) between the different stations. This was difficult work involving around 12 stockmen, including his adult sons Harry Aplin and Arthur Aplin. Five stockmen were assigned to keep the herd on camp, one to mind the drafted cattle and six to ride here, there and everywhere in the herd and chasing wild bullocks by galloping at top speed with stockwhips volleying vicious reports. After the first 20 cattle were drafted off and steadied, the work proceeded more rapidly but sometimes a rogue (known colloquially as a gunner) bullock would charge and bore in on the stockhorse, sending horse and rider crashing to the ground. William Aplin diversified into horse breeding and raised fine herds of up to 500 head of stockhorses. They were mostly the progeny of the thoroughbred sire Exeter (by dam Panic), and the remainder by the grey sire Kelpie. The British Indian Army horse buyer and Townsville warrior, Robert Gordon (1866-1944), used to buy 12 horses each year from Southwick. Also Harry Aplin accompanied some good horses on Company ships to Madras (now Chennai), India, where he sold them direct to the British Army. However the pastoral business did not run to plan and Aplin lost a fortune during the economic cepression of the 1890s, that bottomed with the Bank failures in 1893, compounded by a long drought from 1895, that became the Federation Drought of 1903–1905. In addition cattle herds became infected with redwater fever transmitted by ticks and died in large numbers in the district in 1895 and 'Southwick' lost half of its huge herd. As ill fortune often comes in threes, the Banks then tried to close the station and sell off the assets. William Aplin was described by a bushman as a cheery man who in his heart was always a bushman, with the love of wide open spaces, the brave horses, the flocks spreading over the open downs, or the dash to deal with rowdy cattle, or cut off a mob in a moonlighting expedition. He was a friend of explorer and pastoralist William Hann of Maryvale pastoral station near Charters Towers and travelled with him to attend the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in London in 1886. Around that time Aplin's interests increasingly turned to business in Townsville and politics in Brisbane and he was seldom at home on the range.\n\nParagraph 20: A study published in 2011 by Franco, Turin, Mershin and Skoulakis shows both that flies can smell deuterium, and that to flies, a carbon-deuterium bond smells like a nitrile, which has a similar vibration. The study reports that drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), which is ordinarily attracted to acetophenone, spontaneously dislikes deuterated acetophenone. This dislike increases with the number of deuteriums. (Flies genetically altered to lack smell receptors could not tell the difference.) Flies could also be trained by electric shocks either to avoid the deuterated molecule or to prefer it to the normal one. When these trained flies were then presented with a completely new and unrelated choice of normal vs. deuterated odorants, they avoided or preferred deuterium as with the previous pair. This suggested that flies were able to smell deuterium regardless of the rest of the molecule. To determine whether this deuterium smell was actually due to vibrations of the carbon-deuterium (C-D) bond or to some unforeseen effect of isotopes, the researchers looked to nitriles, which have a similar vibration to the C-D bond. Flies trained to avoid deuterium and asked to choose between a nitrile and its non-nitrile counterpart did avoid the nitrile, lending support to the idea that the flies are smelling vibrations. Further isotope smell studies are under way in fruit flies and dogs.\n\nParagraph 21: On June 2, 2010, Schneider signed a two-year, $1.8 million contract extension with the Vancouver Canucks. Assistant general manager Laurence Gilman asserted that the new deal should establish him as Luongo's backup and garner more exposure to potentially facilitate a trade to another NHL team. He made his first start of the 2010–11 season on October 18, 2010, against the Carolina Hurricanes. He stopped 32 shots in a 5–1 win, marking his first NHL victory since December 14, 2008. Later in the season, he recorded his first NHL shutout, stopping 26 shots in a 3–0 win against the Anaheim Ducks on March 6, 2011. Nearing the end of the regular season, the Canucks were leading the league in team GAA, putting Luongo and Schneider in contention for the William M. Jennings Trophy. However, with a week remaining in the regular season, Schneider was two appearances short of the 25-game minimum to qualify for the Jennings (had he not reached the requirement, Luongo would have been awarded the trophy by himself). While head coach Alain Vigneault initially dismissed the notion of playing Schneider for the sole purpose of sharing the award with Luongo, he sent Schneider in relief of Luongo with 28 seconds remaining in the third-last game of the season, a 2–0 loss to the Edmonton Oilers for Schneider's 24th appearance. Two games later – the Canucks' last contest of the regular season – Schneider was given the start against the Calgary Flames. Needing to allow seven goals or fewer to secure the Jennings, he helped Vancouver to a 3–2 overtime win. It marked the first time in the trophy's history that it was awarded to Canucks goaltenders. Luongo and Schneider's combined GAA of 2.20 was 0.10 better than the Boston Bruins' second-place goaltending tandem of Tim Thomas and Tuukka Rask. Schneider completed his NHL rookie season with a 2.23 GAA and .929 save percentage in 25 games (22 starts), as well as a 16-4-2 record. His GAA tied for fourth in the league, while his save percentage ranked third and set a single-season Canucks record.\n\nParagraph 22: The story is about the relationship between freelance photographer Kouhei Morioka and Hazuki, a young girl who descends from a royal vampire lineage. At the beginning of the story, Kouhei travels to a castle in Germany to take photographs of paranormal phenomena for his friend Hiromi, who is the editor of an occult magazine. At the castle, Kouhei meets Hazuki, who feeds on Kouhei's blood and claims him as her unwilling servant. Although this \"blood pact\" is supposed to bind Kouhei to Hazuki as her obedient slave, her act has no effect on Kouhei. Following an action-packed sorcerers' battle in which Kouhei and his cousin manage to free Hazuki from her captivity in the dreary castle, Hazuki travels to Tokyo, and takes up residence with Kouhei in his grandfather's house in Japan. Hazuki claims that, because she fed on his blood, Kouhei is now her servant, but Kouhei continually refuses to obey her, especially when he thinks her requests are unreasonable. Despite their fighting, the relationship between the duo progresses over time—even in the face of repeated attacks by opposing vampires—until Kouhei becomes determined to protect Hazuki from the vampire servants of her family, who are determined to retrieve her by whatever means necessary.\n\nParagraph 23: Scottish newspaper Aberdeen Evening Express extolled \"[the] haunting strains\" of \"Wicked Game.\" Grant Walters from Albumism praised the song as a \"pristine union of Isaak's aching vocal and the desolate wail of James Calvin Wilsey's '65 Stratocaster.\" He added, \"Underneath, the brushed drum loop, simple bass line, and muted background vocals create a simmering atmospheric buzz.\" Steve Huey from AllMusic described it as a \"shimmering,\" \"spare,\" and \"moody masterpiece.\" Larry Flick from Billboard called it \"[a] delicious treat.\" Alaister Moughan from Dazed wrote, \"Some songs are masterpieces, some represent moments in time, and others are simply good jams. Chris Isaak's \"Wicked Game\" is all three.\" Joe Rhodes from Entertainment Weekly stated that this is \"perhaps the album's darkest mood piece,\" noting its \"otherworldly\" opening guitar line. Pan-European magazine Music & Media described it as \"[a] laid-back C&W tinged song featuring Isaak's Orbison-esque vocals.\" Duncan Holland from Music Week felt that its \"dexterity and panache is something rarely heard. The touches of Roy Orbison only make it stronger and given the right airplay, Isaak should score a significant, if unpredictable hit.\" A reviewer from Sunday Life complimented it as \"[a] brooding ballad, image-laden, and worthy of Roy Orbison in his heyday.\"\n\nParagraph 24: In September 1952, a CIA intelligence report noted the difficulty in continuing to support the Tibetan resistance when the Chinese Communist government and the massive People's Liberation Army (PLA) fully occupied the country. As a result of this Chinese domination over the Tibetans, direct diplomatic relations between Tibet and India ceased. A daily Hindi newspaper reported that this move had ended 16 years of direct contact between the governments of India and Tibet. India was able to have direct communications until that point because China's authority in Tibet was still limited. In the final paragraph of the article, the newspaper writes, \"The Chinese occupation of Tibet a year ago has changed this relationship. The cause was inevitable, and India had no choice but to accept this arrangement because the Chinese Communists now have complete control of the foreign affairs of Tibet\". Previously, India had provided a link for United States' support to the Tibetan resistance. Later that year (December 1952), the CIA produced an Information Report (Classification: Secret) containing two items in the subject line: 1) Anti-Communist Activities, Tibet, and 2) Chinese Communist Activities, Tibet. The document shows that the agency was closely scrutinizing both Tibetan and Chinese groups and individuals at the time, as well as any other obtained intelligence. The report defines the anti-Communist Tibetan People's Party and identified geographic areas where the Party's support was strongest. A 36-year old leader, Lhopto Rimpochhe was named as the leader of the \"warrior monks.\" The document goes on to report on intelligence regarding a petition sent to the Chinese authorities in Lhasa by Ragashar Shape, Tibetan Defense Minister, that went ignored. The Shape petition included the following points: the Dalai Lama should continue to rule unchallenged; monastery estates should not be confiscated; Tibetans should thank the Chinese for liberation but kindly ask them to leave and, in return, the Tibetan people would never ask for military assistance from the Chinese; and persuading the Chinese to \"please buy the [Tibetan] wool.\" The document then proceeded to provide intelligence on various undesired actions taken by the Chinese including forcing the Dalai Lama to give a  speech the threat of death, kidnapping over 200 children for the purpose of retraining them (one was even beheaded as a warning to the others not to cry and complain), and the installation of a puppet governor at Kham. Next, the document listed nine names of Tibetans acting as informers against the Chinese. Lastly, Chinese forces in Tibet were addressed—numbers of troops, names, and leadership transition information.\n\nParagraph 25: The following year, Olympiacos had a top-class roster with players like Roy Tarpley, Žarko Paspalj, Dragan Tarlać, Panagiotis Fasoulas, Giorgos Sigalas, Milan Tomić, Franco Nakić and Efthimis Bakatsias, and reached the FIBA European League Final Four in Yad Eliyahu Arena, Tel Aviv for the first time in their history. After an impressive run in the top 16, achieving significant away wins for the first time in the European history of the club against Real Madrid Teka (58–57 in Palacio de Deportes) or against Benetton Treviso (79–73 in Palaverde) and a newfound home victory by 18 points difference against FC Barcelona Banca Catalana (82–64), the \"Reds\" qualified as group winners (11–3 record) for the quarter-final playoffs where they faced the ranked fourth of the group B, the Italian champions Buckler Beer Bologna of Yugoslav superstar Sasha Danilović and eliminated them hardly with 2–1 wins. In the Tel Aviv Final Four which was looked like an Athenaic-Catalan tournament demonstration, they faced their arch-rivals Panathinaikos in the semi-final (by the way the other semi-final was FC Barcelona Banca Catalana vs 7up Joventut), beating them 77–72 and becoming the first Greek team to ever play in the Euroleague Final. Paspalj scored 22 points and Tarpley recorded a double-double against Panathinaikos, scoring 21 points and grabbing no less than 16 rebounds for Olympiacos. The \"Reds\", despite being strong favourites to win the European crown, lost 57–59 to 7up Joventut in the final after a dramatic ending. Domestically, they had a very successful season, as they managed to celebrate the Double, winning an extremely competitive Greek Championship with 3–2 wins against PAOK Bravo of Bane Prelević, Walter Berry and Zoran Savić -who had been crowned FIBA Korać Cup champions two months earlier- and the Greek Cup as well, beating Stiebel Eltron Iraklis 63–51 in the final in SEF.\n\nParagraph 26: Hampton University is a private, historically black, research university in Hampton, Virginia. Founded in 1868 as Hampton Agricultural and Industrial School, it was established by Black and White leaders of the American Missionary Association after the American Civil War to provide education to freedmen. The campus houses the Hampton University Museum, which is the oldest museum of the African diaspora in the United States and the oldest museum in the commonwealth of Virginia. First led by former Union General Samuel Chapman Armstrong, Hampton University's main campus is located on 314 acres in Hampton, Virginia, on the banks of the Hampton River. \n\nParagraph 27: To catalogue early Chinese stamps is complicated. The first postage stamps in China were, in fact, issued by the western nations occupying special concessions, known as 'Treaty Ports', which had been snatched from Imperial China by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. The first Treaty Ports stamp was issued in 1865 by the Shanghai Municipal Post, with additional Local Posts followed in sixteen other Treaty Ports. The postal services were taken over by the Qing government in November 1897 after it established the Imperial Chinese Post. After the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty in 1911, central authority was broken apart. During the period of the Republic of China (1912 - 1949), ongoing conflict between the Beiyang government, the Nationalist's Guomindang government, the Communist party (about 1930 - 1949), the remnant Northern warlords government, and the Empire of Japan all further fragmented China's postal system. Without a unified central government, the semi-autonomous regional governments issued their own stamps at various times to meet postal needs; Japan had issued \"Occupation\" stamps through their puppet governments, and the Chinese Communist Party had issued \"Liberated area\" stamps. The designation \"Liberated Areas\" refers to areas the Communists \"liberated\" from the Nationalists and / or the Japanese. The Liberated Areas alone already issued an estimated more than 500 sets of stamps with over 2,300 values. As these stamps are printed under war conditions, done mostly underground, and most of the stamps are coarsely printed using the simplest printing techniques on sub-standard equipment, and made use of any raw material available at the time.  In fact, the first stamps issued by the new Nationalist government simply utilized remaining stocks of Imperial stamps, overprinting them with the words, 'Republic of China' until they could print new stamps. Outside of the Liberated Areas, co-existing provisional governments also find themselves difficult to unify their monetary system with the central authority of the time. Disparities and devaluation of local currencies from the ever-changing National Currency (oftentimes value had to be recalculated in a matter of hours) only promoted speculation on stamps. Such complicating factors demanded an unusual varieties of overprints (to restrict their use in a designated region so to stop speculators from profiting) or surcharging (charging extra money in National currency to make up for the difference in value). Moreover, as the central printing is done in Beijing or by externally contracted printers, the stamps are often delayed and rendering the value printed on the stamps useless. At times of an urgent need for postage stamps quickly, stocks of old issue stamps are simply overprinted by the local Post Masters, which often resulted in minor differences in design and colour variations occurring between official printers. After such a long period of complicated factors, coupled with other secret markings and numerous printing errors in between had all made it very difficult to distinguish and to document every early Chinese stamp, comprehensively or by chronological order alone.\n\nParagraph 28: There are two principal facies of lower Paleozoic rocks in Nevada.  In the eastern part of the state, a north-trending fossil-rich carbonate shelf of Ordovician to Devonian age, termed the carbonate or eastern assemblage, gives way westward to a contemporaneous expanse of siliceous sedimentary deposits and minor mafic volcanic rocks termed the siliceous or western assemblage. Crafford assigned these two facies respectively to the shelf domain and the basin domain.  The dark color of the western assemblage, the scarcity of carbonate rocks, and a near absence of shelly fossils, are generally interpreted to indicate a relatively deep-water depositional environment.  The western assemblage also differs from the eastern assemblage in its components of bedded chert, basalt bodies, barite deposits, and sulfide deposits. The nature of the two assemblages and their relation to one another are critical for an understanding of the Antler orogeny.  The western facies assemblage is generally thought to be displaced from the west and to constitute the upper plate of an extensive thrust fault—the Roberts Mountains thrust.  The eastern facies assemblage is thought to extend westward under the thrust plate.  The basis for this belief is that the western facies domain is dotted with anomalous blocky exposures of contemporaneous eastern facies shelf strata, some of mountain size, surrounded by exposures of western facies rocks. These have been interpreted almost universally as exposures of the carbonate shelf facies in windows of the Roberts Mountains thrust sheet, and to prove the existence of that thrust sheet.\n\nParagraph 29: The Crimson Tide has appeared in ten post-season Tournaments for the NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship, including an eight-year streak of consecutive appearances in the tournament stretching from 1992 to 1999. In ten NCAA tournament appearances, Alabama has advanced to the \"Sweet Sixteen\" six times and the \"Elite Eight\" and the \"Final Four\" in 1994. The most successful season was 1996–1997 when the Tide finished second in the Southeastern Conference (10–2 record) and had a mid-season national ranking of No.2 in polls by the AP and USA Today (November 12, 1996); they finished with a 25–7 overall record. The University of Alabama Women's Basketball program shares the national record with Duke University for the most total points for both teams when Alabama defeated Duke 121–120 (in four overtimes) in 1995 in the NCAA tournament, a game that ESPN has declared as one of the best all-time women's basketball tournament games. Seven former players for the University of Alabama have made rosters of teams of the WNBA. Alabama has had an active player in the WNBA through every year of its existence. The current head coach for the Crimson Tide is Kristy Curry. The team played its first season of 1974–75 in Foster Auditorium, but moved to what is now Coleman Coliseum the following season. After Foster Auditorium was extensively renovated in a project that began in 2009, the Tide returned to their original home on February 13, 2011.\n\nParagraph 30: Boulevard Puerto Aéreo metro station is a station of the Mexico City Metro in Venustiano Carranza, Mexico City. It is an underground station with two side platforms served by Line 1 (the Pink Line) between Balbuena and Gómez Farías stations. It serves the colonias (neighborhoods) of Moctezuma, Santa Cruz Aviación, and Valentín Gómez Farías. It lies below Puerto Aéreo Boulevard, from which it receives its name, and it is near Calzada Ignacio Zaragoza. The station's pictogram features a silhouette of an air vent below a road bridge, in reference to a landmark found at the intersection of both avenues. The station is partially accessible for people with disabilities.\n\nThe following is an abstract.\n\nThis text discusses the changing relationship between Tibet and India in the 1950s due to Chinese occupation. It highlights that direct diplomatic relations between Tibet and India ceased after the Chinese Communist government and the People's Liberation Army fully occupied Tibet. Previously, India had provided a link for US support to the Tibetan resistance. The CIA produced an information report closely scrutinizing Tibetan and Chinese groups, including the anti-Communist Tibetan People's Party. The report also mentions a petition sent by the Tibetan Defense Minister to the Chinese authorities, which went ignored. It reveals various undesired actions taken by the Chinese in Tibet, such as forcing the Dalai Lama to give a speech under threat of death and kidnapping children for retraining. The document also includes a list of Tibetans acting as informers against the Chinese and provides information on Chinese forces in Tibet.\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from.

Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.\n\nParagraph 1: I wrote the initial idea for 'One Sweet Day' with Walter, and I had the chorus...and I stopped and said, 'I really wanna do this with Boyz II Men,' because...obviously I'm a big fan of theirs and I just thought that the work was crying out for them, the vocals that they do, so I put it away and said, 'Who knows if this could ever happen, but I just don't wanna finish this song because I want it to be our song if we ever do it together. [The] whole idea of when you lose people that are close to you, it changes your life and changes your perspective. When they came into the studio, I played them the idea for the song and when [it] was finished, they looked at each other, a bit stunned, and told me that Nathan \"Nate\" Morris had written a song for his road manager who had passed away. It had basically the same lyrics and fitted over the same chord changes. It was really, really weird, we finished the song right then and there. We were all kinda flipped about it ourselves. Fate had a lot to do with that. I know some people won't believe it, but we wouldn't make up such a crazy story.\n\nParagraph 2: The U.S. estimated that as many as 25,000 Americans citizens were in Lebanon, but the number finally evacuated was approximately 15,000. After hostilities began on July 12, 2006, media reports hinted that U.S. Navy ships from the Iwo Jima Expeditionary Strike Group could be moved from exercises in the Red Sea to an offshore position in Lebanon. Shortly after, the U.S. announced and began executing a plan to evacuate its nationals using military assets, as well as a chartered cruise ship, the Orient Queen, under guard by the destroyers Gonzalez (DDG 66) and Barry (DDG 52). According to Joint Task Force Lebanon/Task Force 59 spokesperson Navy Commander Darryn C. James, since hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah militants began on July 12, 2006, the \"sea bridge\" and \"air bridge\" provided by U.S. Central Command and U.S. European Command assets helped nearly 15,000 American citizens safely depart Lebanon—one of the largest evacuations in U.S. military history. Dubbed Operation \"Strengthen Hope,\" Department of Defense (DoD) assets such as HSV-2 Swift were also instrumental in assisting in the distribution of millions of dollars (of a U.S. pledged 230 million) in humanitarian aid to the Lebanese people. Task Force 59 personnel, led by Marine Corps Brigadier General Carl B. Jensen, were the first to arrive in the \"joint operation area\" (JOA) region on July 16 where DoD assets evacuated 21 American citizens out of Beirut by helicopter on the first day. On July 21, DoD assets moved more than 3,000 people and brought the total of American citizens evacuated that week to more than 6,000. Sailors and Marines from the Iwo Jima (LHD 7) Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG) including Nashville (LPD 13), Whidbey Island (LSD 41), Trenton (LPD 14) and the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (24th MEU) arrived on station July 20 and began using utility landing craft (LCU) to safely transport American citizens wishing to depart Lebanon to avoid the hostilities. By July 24, more than 12,000 American citizens had been pulled out of Lebanon. Most of the American citizens were transported to the island nation of Cyprus. The transfer in military responsibility to the organization that would become JTF Lebanon led by Navy Vice Admiral John \"Boomer\" Stufflebeem, continued the DoD mission to protect American citizens, support the American Embassy in Beirut, assist the people of Lebanon through humanitarian aid, and help the multinational effort to provide lasting regional stability.\n\nParagraph 3: In the early 1980s, Jackie Chan began experimenting with elaborate stunt action sequences in films such as The Young Master (1980) and especially Dragon Lord (1982), which featured a pyramid fight scene that holds the record for the most takes required for a single scene, with 2900 takes, and the final fight scene in which he performs various stunts, including one where he does a back flip off a loft and falls to the lower ground. By 1983, Chan branched out into action films which, though they still used martial arts, were less limited in scope, setting and plot, with an emphasis on elaborate yet dangerous stunt sequences. His first film in this vein, Project A (1983), saw the official formation of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team and added elaborate, dangerous stunts to the fights and typical slapstick humor (at one point, Chan falls from the top of a clock tower through a series of fabric canopies). The new formula helped Project A gross over  in Hong Kong, and significantly more in other Asian countries such as Japan, where it grossed  and became one of the highest-grossing films of 1984. Winners and Sinners (1983) also featured an elaborate action sequence that involves Chan skating along a busy high road, including a risky stunt where he slides under a truck.\n\nParagraph 4: In the summer of 2005, Popham returned to Wales, signing for the Scarlets as a replacement for the retiring Scott Quinnell after being released from his Leeds contract early. He played in 24 of the Scarlets' first 26 games of the season before suffering an injury early in the 36–17 win over the Dragons on 22 April that saw him miss the next two matches. He scored his first try for the Scarlets in their 15–13 win over Edinburgh Gunners in the Heineken Cup. His second Scarlets try came in the return fixture against Edinburgh, but it was not enough to prevent a 33–32 defeat that eliminated the Scarlets from the competition. In February 2006, the Scarlets appealed to the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) for the release of some of their key players, including Popham, from the Wales squad involved in the 2006 Six Nations for their Anglo-Welsh Cup semi-final tie with Bath on 4 March. The Scarlets won 27–26 at the Millennium Stadium, with Popham giving a man-of-the-match performance to reach his second straight Powergen Cup final. Less than a minute into the final, Popham collided with Wasps flanker Johnny O'Connor, who was knocked out and had to be stretchered off, having suffered a spinal concussion. Despite Wasps having to make an early change and also being temporarily reduced to 14 men during the first half, the Scarlets lost the match 26–10. On 9 May 2006, Popham scored both of the Scarlets' tries in an 18–6 win over Munster. The following weekend, he was sent off in the Scarlets' 17–10 loss to Glasgow Warriors; after initially being sin-binned for a high tackle in the first half, he received a second yellow card for his reaction to a decision by referee George Clancy, ruling him out of the Scarlets' final game of the season and putting his eligibility for Wales' tour to Argentina in doubt. Before the end of his first season there, Popham signed a contract extension with the Scarlets, keeping him at the region until the end of the 2008–09 season.\n\nParagraph 5: Chol played his first match for 2020 in the opening round of the AFL pre-season series, but was dropped back to reserves level for the second and final match following the return of the club's premier tall forwards, Jack Riewoldt and Tom Lynch, from State of Origin duties. Instead, he participated in a VFL practice match in the first week of March, which was to be his final competitive match in many months as the following week's reserves match was cancelled due to safety concerns as a result of the rapid progression of the COVID-19 pandemic into Australia. Though the AFL season would start on schedule later that month, just one round of matches was played of the reduced 17-round season before the imposition of state border restrictions saw the season suspended for an indefinite period. When the season resumed after an 11-week hiatus, Chol played in an unofficial scratch match against 's reserves due to AFL clubs' withdrawal from the VFL season. After two more scratch matches at reserves level including a five-goal haul against 's reserves, Chol was selected for an AFL recall in the club's round 5 win over . He continued to earn AFL selection over coming weeks, including after the club was relocated to the Gold Coast in response to a virus outbreak in Melbourne. Chol kicked two goals against  in round 7 and added another in round 9's win over the . He featured in each of the club's next four matches, including with two goals against  in round 12 and a goal in round 13's Dreamtime in Darwin win over . He was omitted from the club's round 14 side however, overlooked in place of returning ruck Toby Nankervis. Chol spent three rounds out of the side before earning an AFL recall following a five goal showing in a mid-September practice match against the  reserves. He played a dual role as ruck and forward in the round 18 win over , filling roles left by injured duo Ivan Soldo and Tom Lynch. Chol held his spot and played his first finals match in the first week of October, contributing seven disposals and nine hitouts in a qualifying final loss to the . It was to be his last match of the season however, with Lynch returning from injury for the club's semi-final and Chol relegated to emergency status for each of the three remaining finals in the club's premiership run. He finished the season having played 11 of a possible 21 matches, kicking a total of eight goals.\n\nParagraph 6: For decades the Conservatives were split on India between die-hard imperialists (led by Churchill) and moderate elements who tried to provide limited local control.  Meanwhile, the small Labour minority in Parliament was sympathetic to the Congress movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharial Nehru. Decolonisation was never a major election issue; Labour was not officially in favour of decolonisation when it was elected in 1945. With violence escalating in India after the war, but with British financial power at a low ebb, large-scale military involvement was impossible. The Viceroy of India warned he needed a further seven army divisions to prevent communal violence if independence negotiations failed. None were available, so political restructuring was accelerated. The Labour government gave independence to India and Pakistan in an unexpectedly quick move in 1947.  One recent historian and Conservative party sympathiser Andrew Roberts says the independence of India was a \"national humiliation\" but it was necessitated by urgent financial, administrative, strategic and political needs.  Whereas Churchill in 1940–45 had tightened the hold on India and imprisoned the Congress leadership, Labour had looked forward to making it a fully independent dominion like Canada or Australia. Many of the Congress leaders in India had studied in England, and were highly regarded as fellow idealistic socialists by Labour leaders. Attlee was the Labour expert on India and took special charge of decolonization.  Attlee found that Churchill's viceroy, Field Marshal Archibald Wavell, was too imperialistic, too keen on military solutions (he wanted seven more Army divisions) and too neglectful of Indian political alignments. The new Viceroy was Lord Mountbatten, the dashing war hero and a cousin of King George VI. The boundary between the newly created states of Pakistan and India involved the widespread resettlement of millions of Muslims and Hindus (and many Sikhs). Extreme violence ensued when Punjab and Bengal provinces were split. Historian Yasmin Khan estimates that between a half-million and a million men, women and children were killed. Gandhi himself was assassinated by a Hindu activist in January 1948.  Popular and elite opinion in Britain at the time did not view Indian independence as a humiliation but as a successful completion of a process long underway, and strongly supported by Labour and indeed most of the conservative party as well. A major reason that Churchill was in the wilderness during the 1930s was his refusal to support the Conservative position in favor of independence for India. Independence strengthened the Commonwealth of Nations, and had a valuable impact on the British economy, with large sums transferring back and forth, as well as fresh migrants arriving from India. In sharp contrast, France felt humiliated by its loss of its colonial empire, especially Algeria and Vietnam. The success  in India encouraged and embolden the development programs of ambitious young British colonial officials in Africa and the rest of Asia.\n\nParagraph 7: \"Manchuria\" is a translation of the Japanese word Manshū (满洲), which dates from the 19th century. The name Manju (Manzhou) was invented and given to the Jurchen people by Hong Taiji in 1635 as a new name for their ethnic group, however, the name \"Manchuria\" was never used by the Manchus or the Qing dynasty itself to refer to their homeland. According to the Japanese scholar Junko Miyawaki-Okada, the Japanese geographer Takahashi Kageyasu was the first to use the term (满洲, Manshū) as a place-name in 1809 in the Nippon Henkai Ryakuzu, and it was from that work where Westerners adopted the name. According to Mark C. Elliott, Katsuragawa Hoshū's 1794 work, the  \"Hokusa bunryaku\", was where the term \"Manshū\" first appeared as a place name was in two maps included in the work, \"Ashia zenzu\" and \"Chikyū hankyū sōzu\" which were also created by Katsuragawa. \"Manshū\" then began to appear as a place names in more maps created by Japanese like Kondi Jūzō, Takahashi Kageyasu, Baba Sadayoshi and Yamada Ren, and these maps were brought to Europe by the Dutch Philipp von Siebold. According to Nakami Tatsuo, Philip Franz von Siebold was the one who brought the usage of the term Manchuria to Europeans, after borrowing it from the Japanese, who were the first to use it in a geographic manner in the eighteenth century, while neither the Manchu nor Chinese languages had a term in their own language equivalent to \"Manchuria\" as a geographic place name. According to , it was Europeans who first started using Manchuria as a name to refer to the location and it is \"not a genuine geographic term.\" The historian Gavan McCormack agreed with Robert H. G. Lee's statement that \"The term Manchuria or Man-chou is a modern creation used mainly by westerners and Japanese.\", with McCormack writing that the term Manchuria is imperialistic in nature and has no \"precise meaning\", since the Japanese deliberately promoted the use of \"Manchuria\" as a geographic name to promote its separation from China while they were setting up their puppet state of Manchukuo. The Japanese had their own motive for deliberately spreading the usage of the term Manchuria. The historian Norman Smith wrote that \"The term \"Manchuria\" is controversial\". Professor Mariko Asano Tamanoi said that she \"should use the term in quotation marks\", when referring to Manchuria. Herbert Giles wrote that \"Manchuria\" was unknown to the Manchus themselves as a geographical expression; In his 2012 dissertation on the Jurchen people Professor Chad D. Garcia noted that usage of the term \"Manchuria\" is out of favor in \"currently scholarly practice\" and he did away with using the term, using instead \"the northeast\" or referring to specific geographical features.\n\nParagraph 8: The Durance is  long from its source at the foot of Sommet des Anges, at  high, above Montgenèvre, to its confluence with the Rhône. However, a longer route is traced by the Clarée-Durance system with a length of . Its descent is unusually rapid at 81 m/km (165 ft/mi) in its first , then 15 m/km (30 ft/mi) to its confluence with the , and then still nearly 8 m/km (16 ft/mi) to the confluence with the Ubaye. This descent stays relatively steep after this confluence, then shallows to approximately 0.33% in its middle course (to the Mirabeau bridge), then 0.24% in its lower course. For comparison, at approximately  from its source, the Isère is at  altitude and the Durance at , which contributes partially to its fast-flowing nature, including in the lower part of the river. It drops  from its source to Mirabeau and approximately  from its source to the confluence with the Rhône.\n\nParagraph 9: Later on, he receives a call from Avogadro to participate in his interrogation of Buckmaster. During the interrogation, Buckmaster constantly defends himself, saying that he was drugged from the transtemporallism. Avogadro is shocked that Shadrach also attempts to defend Buckmaster, but more passively. However, in the end, Buckmaster is arrested on the basis of a faulty \"I'll destroy him\" while he was arguing with Shadrach at Karakorum. Shadrach then argues with Avogadro, saying that it was not justified to arrest a man he knew was innocent. However, Avogadro is apathetic to the plight of Buckmaster and even uses Shadrach's words at Karakorum against him that \"guilt is a luxury we cannot afford\". They both assume that Buckmaster is being sent to the Organ Farms, where his organs would be used to support the dictator.  The next day, Shadrach visits Genghis Mao, who speaks deliriously and even offers to make Shadrach pope in Rome. Shadrach infers that Genghis Mao has gone mad over the death of Mangu. That night, he goes to Karakorum with Katya Lindman, where they try dream-death, an experience where one is placed in a dream-like state and imagines death and the subsequent afterlife. Shadrach travels the afterlife realm with Katya in his dreams, and after enjoying themselves, to enters into a tranquil state before awaking. Katya reveals that she was having a different dream from him, one which was not as light-hearted as his. Then, they return home to rest, where Katya randomly and suddenly warns Shadrach to be careful. Nikki Crowfoot grows increasingly distant from him, and Shadrach is unable to discover why. He visits Genghis Mao and informs the dictator of an aneurysm he detected in the dictator's abdominal aorta. The news annoys Genghis Mao, since he is preparing a colossal funeral for Mangu which he refuses to delay. Shadrach has lunch with Katya, who reveals to him that, on the night before his death, she informed Mangu that he was chosen as the Avatar subject. Katya tells Shadrach that she did so only out of sympathy for Mangu, but Shadrach suspects that she wanted to kill the Avatar subject so that her project could supersede Nikki's and hopefully destroy her relationship with Shadrach so she could have him too. However, he soon realises that his suspicions contradict Katya's decision to reveal this information to him. Shadrach hopes to visit Nikki and after learning that she had fallen ill, makes the decision to visit her in her room. There, he pretends to examine her but subsequently asks about her project, to which she responds angrily, ranting about the setbacks in her work. As Shadrach leaves, he also reveals to Nikki that a member of Project Talos informed Mangu that he had been chosen as the Avatar subject, but he disguises it as a rumour. However, Nikki believes it and instantly suspects Katya Lindman to be the culprit. Later, Shadrach confesses to Katya what he had revealed to Nikki. Katya is disturbed at first, but soon informs Shadrach that he had been chosen as the next Avatar subject. Shadrach soon realises that that had to be the reason Nikki had chosen to distance herself from him. Katya advises Shadrach to make a plan of escape and also tells him not to trust Nikki anymore, since she must have agreed to continue her work despite the fact that he was chosen. The day of the aorta transplant arrives. During the surgeries, Shadrach thinks to himself that if he killed Genghis Mao on the operating table, Project Avatar would be finished. He muses about plans such as jostling Warhaftig's elbow or feeding them misleading information, but resolves not to.\n\nParagraph 10: Guarani Football Club was founded on April 1, 1911, in the city of Campinas, São Paulo, as Guarany Foot-Ball Club, by the initiative of 12 students from the Gymnasio do Estado (now Culto à Ciência). The students, including Pompeo de Vito, Hernani Felippo Matallo and Vicente Matallo, usually played football at Praça Carlos Gomes. Vicente Matallo became Guarani's first president. Guarani was named after maestro Antônio Carlos Gomes' opera \"Il Guarany\". Antônio Carlos Gomes was born in Campinas, Brazil, and is one of the most distinguished nineteenth century classical composers. Guarani was officially founded on April 1, 1911, but to avoid April Fools' Day jokes by supporters of rival teams, the directors of Guarani changed the official foundation date to April 2, 1911.\n\nParagraph 11: About 475,000 people reside within a  radius, with the town itself holding a population of around 30,000. Tzaneen is today a proud home of both the Tsonga and Bapedi. Approximately 225,000 Bapedi Tribes of Balobedu ba ga Modjadji, BaNareng ba ga sekororo, Batlou ba ga makgoba, Bathlabine ba ga mogoboya, BaKgaga ba maake, Bakgaga ba maupa and Babirwa ba ga Raphahlelo, phooko and Bakoni ba mametja call Tzaneen their home. Equally so, approximately 220,000 Tsonga  tribes of Shiluvane-Nkuna tribe Hosi Muhlaba-Shiluvane (132,000 people/subjects) and Valoyi tribe under Hosi Nwamitwa-Valoyi (91,000 people/subjects) make the same claim that Tzaneen is also their native land, thereby making the Tsonga-Bapedi ratio at Tzaneen a 50:50 outcome. Both the Tsonga nation and Bapedi Nation communities go beyond Tzaneen and are also found in large numbers in nearby towns of Bushbuckridge and Hazyview respectively, which are  south-east of Tzaneen and they also live peacefully with one another in this part of the Lowveld. The White population is around 25,000, which consists mainly the Afrikaner people and a very small minority of English, Portuguese, Scottish, Irish,  and German. The Afrikaner people constitute more than 90% of the white population in Tzaneen. The distance from Tzaneen to Johannesburg is approximately .\n\nParagraph 12: LaBarba began boxing around age 12 or 13 in little amateur cards held weekly at places such as the Elks Club, which were promoted by Carlo Curtiss, who had been one of World Heavyweight Champion Jess Willard's managers. \"Sometimes we would have nude women at these events,\" he said. The first known mention of \"Young Fidel\" is September 17, 1920, by the Los Angeles Times, announcing a boxing/wrestling show at the Italian picnic the next day at Selig Zoo where his opponent was to be \"Battling Bennie\", newsboy like Fidel. Eventually, Central Junior High School boxing instructor Bob Howard saw his potential. According to an interview published January 28, 1927 in some United States newspapers, LaBarba mentioned that he defeated a boy named Dave Mariney (a.k.a. Marini) for the high school championship. Based upon this win, his friends suggested he join the amateurs, which he did. By this, he likely meant he joined the A.A.U. Fidel found it ironic that his first \"official\" amateur opponent was none other than Dave Mariney. This was at a semi-monthly boxing show sponsored by the Los Angeles Athletic Club (L.A.A.C). \"It looked like a crime to match the two,\" reported the Los Angeles Times November 4, 1920. LaBarba was about four feet tall, and his opponent a foot and a half taller. \"But LaBarba soon showed he knew how to take care of himself.\"\n\nParagraph 13: Although not related to them, Cinna shared the surname (cognomen) of the high noble (consular) aristocratic house Cornelii Cinnae, relatives by marriage of the famous Caesar. According to Suetonius, Valerius Maximus, Appian and Dio Cassius, at Julius Caesar's funeral in 44 BC, a certain Helvius Cinna was killed because he was mistaken for Cornelius Cinna, the conspirator. The last three writers mentioned above add that he was a tribune of the people, while Plutarch, referring to the affair, gives the further information that the Cinna who was killed by the mob was a poet. This points to the identity of Helvius Cinna the tribune with Helvius Cinna the poet.\n\nParagraph 14: On the start of the monsoon, the project gets suspended and the daily wage workers are left without jobs. Naik and Palegar declare that they will take care of everyone without a job by taking them to the city and keeping them in their homes. They convince the project owner and a reluctant Purushottham to make the people go with them to the city. Naik takes the entire group to his house while Palegar takes Belli to his house. Naik's family refuses to acknowledge him and the people while he innocently makes them settle in his house. His father, brother and sister in law walk out of the house in a huff but his mother takes his side and appreciates his choice of a fiancé in Parvathi. Meanwhile, Palegar's father has been made the chairman of a disabled institution. He ironically refuses to accept his son marrying a blind girl and throws both of them out. Naik tries to convince Dalavayee to take Roopli back but Dalavayee's marriage has been fixed to a rich man's daughter who has promised him an imported car as a gift. However, the plight of Roopli and the people he stayed with makes him change his mind and he decides to convince his parents. Naik takes Palegar and Belli and returns to his house to find that all his guests have been thrown out by his family with a warning that the police will be called in case they try to reenter the house. Naik storms in and fights with his father, brother and sister in law while his mother remains a mute spectator. Dalavayee tries to reason with his parents about accepting Roopli as his wife but his parents, disappointed that they will not be getting the assured gifts from his arranged marriage disinherit him and throw him out at gunpoint. Roopli tries to make him leave her and go back to his parents but he rushes back in and shoots them with the same gun. He then tells Roopli to enjoy the few moments they have together before he gets arrested. At Naik's house, his family makes it clear that they want nothing to do with him or his group with the exception of his mother who declares that she is proud of him for his ideals, but goes back inside eventually. The police are called and in the melee that follows, Palegar goes after a running Belli to fall under a speeding truck. He dies after voicing his last wish to have his eyes donated to Belli and requesting Naik to make her see the good that the world has to offer. Naik, who is visibly crushed, cradles the head of his dead friend and questions aloud as to why is god being so cruel with them to which a disembodied voice replies that God is not cruel. It is the society instead, who is cruel, having made divisions based on caste, status, language and other differences. The movie ends with the voice saying that these forces in the society have made people forget about the true purpose of life, happiness.\n\nParagraph 15: Two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy has similarities to other confocal laser microscopy techniques such as laser scanning confocal microscopy and Raman microscopy. These techniques use focused laser beams scanned in a raster pattern to generate images, and both have an optical sectioning effect. Unlike confocal microscopes, multiphoton microscopes do not contain pinhole apertures that give confocal microscopes their optical sectioning quality. The optical sectioning produced by multiphoton microscopes is a result of the point spread function of the excitation: the multiphoton point spread function is typically dumbbell-shaped (longer in the x-y plane), compared to the upright rugby-ball shaped point spread function of confocal microscopes. The concept of two-photon excitation is based on the idea that two photons, of comparably lower photon energy than needed for one photon excitation, can also excite a fluorophore in one quantum event. Each photon carries approximately half the energy necessary to excite the molecule. Excitation results in the subsequent emission of a fluorescence photon with the same quantum yield that would result from conventional single-photon absorption. The emitted photon is typically at a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than either of the two exciting photons. The probability of the near-simultaneous absorption of two photons is extremely low. Therefore, a high peak flux of excitation photons is typically required, usually generated by femtosecond pulsed laser. The purpose of employing the two-photon effect is that the axial spread of the point spread function is substantially lower than for single-photon excitation. As a result, the extent along the z dimension is improved, allowing for thin optical sections to be cut. In addition, in many interesting cases the shape of the spot and its size can be designed to realize specific desired goals. The longer wavelength, lower energy (typically infrared) excitation lasers of multiphoton microscopes are well-suited to use in imaging live cells as they cause less damage than the short-wavelength lasers typically used for single-photon excitation, so cells may be observed for longer periods with fewer toxic effects.\n\nParagraph 16: At the ECW premier pay-per-view event Barely Legal, Sandman wrestled a three-way dance with Terry Funk and Stevie Richards, for a shot at the ECW title later that night, but fell short of the title. In the summer of 1997, the Sandman began a long feud with Sabu. Although he was too injured to compete at Hardcore Heaven 1997, Sandman got involved in a skirmish with Rob Van Damn and Sabu who then brutalized him to the point of hospitalization, however, he returned later that evening to interference in the main event by assaulting Sabu, leading to Sabu's elimination, costing Sabu the ECW title. In September of that year at As Good as It Gets, Sabu badly burned the Sandman in a scheduled contest between the two. The damage to Sandman from the burn was considered so bad that the match was discontinued. As a result, Sandman was out of action until he once again attacked Van Dam and Sabu in the ring that November, earning a measure of revenge on Sabu. This led to their match at the November to Remember pay per view, which was promoted as a major cornerstone and culmination of all the events that year. In the match, Sandman dodged an attempt by Sabu to burn him, however Sabu went on to win the match. Over the next few months, they competed in high profile specialty matches such as ladder matches, table matches, and a dueling cane match. In one of the most notable examples, the Sandman fought Sabu in the 1st ever \"stairway to hell\" match involving tables ladders chairs and barbwire, which is especially noteworthy because no barb wire matches had been scheduled in ECW since after barb wire ripped open Sabu's bicep and required over 100 stitches in August 1997. The stairway to hell match proved to be one of the most violent in ECW history, coincidentally Sabu broke his jaw when missing a dive onto Sandman and inadvertently hit the guard rail, but continued to fight. After suffering heavy damage, Sandman earned the victory by finally pinning Sabu after hitting him with a cane. However, it wasn't until almost two months later that their feud effectively came to an end at Living Dangerously 1998. This match was heavily promoted and designated the penultimate which featured a dueling canes gimmick. During the match, the combination of Rob Van Dam and Sabu turned out to be too much for the Sandman, which led to him losing the contest.\n\nParagraph 17: The co-main event was for the NXT Women's Championship, contested between champion Sasha Banks and challenger Bayley. It was described as the \"arrogant and ultra-talented champ\" taking on the \"lovable ... ultimate underdog\" by The Baltimore Sun. This was the culmination of a rivalry between the duo and a long storyline for Bayley which began over two years prior. In June 2013, both Bayley (debuting an innocent character) and Banks participated in the tournament to crown the first NXT Women's Champion, but both were eliminated in the first round. Banks aligned herself with Summer Rae that September to form \"The BFFs.\" She then changed her gimmick to \"The Boss\", while Bayley aligned herself with Charlotte. Despite Rae and Banks attempting to persuade Bayley to join their alliance, it was Charlotte who turned on Bayley in November to join The BFFs. In early 2014, Bayley, now backed up by Natalya, scored multiple wins over Banks while feuding with The BFFs, but Banks defeated Bayley in May during the first round of a tournament for the vacant NXT Women's Championship. In July, The BFFs disbanded, and Bayley failed to defeat Rae for a title shot. Bayley finally became the number one contender for the title by beating Banks in August, only to lose to champion Charlotte at TakeOver: Fatal 4-Way in September, and again in a title rematch the next month. After the first match, Charlotte saved Bayley from an attack by Banks; after the second, the duo shook hands. In October 2014, Bayley's friend Becky Lynch turned on her to join Sasha Banks, so Bayley again allied with Charlotte to feud against Banks and Lynch. An attack by Banks and Lynch caused a storyline knee injury for Bayley in November, while Charlotte beat Banks at TakeOver: R Evolution to retain her title in December 2014. Bayley returned in January 2015, saving Charlotte from Banks and Lynch. Charlotte then snatched her title belt from Bayley, resulting in Bayley attacking her. This caused a fatal-four-way match to be set up between the four women at TakeOver: Rival. Banks won the match and the NXT Women's Championship. When Bayley refused to turn her back on her supporters despite her failings, Emma slapped her to start a feud in March 2015. In April, Becky Lynch beat Bayley and Charlotte in a triple threat match for a title shot. Bayley's woes continued when she lost to Emma in May, as well as being ruled out of action with a hand injury, for which she blamed Emma for. Meanwhile, Sasha Banks racked up successful title defenses in singles action with two against Charlotte, one against Alexa Bliss, and at TakeOver: Unstoppable, one against Becky Lynch. Bayley returned on the July 22 episode of NXT, where she defeated Emma and announced her championship aspirations, but first challenged Charlotte to prove her credentials. After Bayley defeated Charlotte on the August 5 episode of NXT, she earned a title shot by beating Becky Lynch the following week, earning a title match for Banks' NXT Women's Championship at TakeOver: Brooklyn.\n\nParagraph 18: Jules Bledsoe was born Julius Lorenzo Cobb Bledsoe to Henry L. and Jessie Cobb Bledsoe in Waco, Texas in 1898. When Bledsoe's parents split in 1899, Julius went with his mother to live with the Cobb family. During his youth Bledsoe attended Central Texas Academy from 1905 to 1914. After graduating as valedictorian he studied at Bishop College where he earned his B.A. in 1918. He then attended Virginia Union College from 1918 to 1919, where he was a member of ROTC, and finally Columbia University, where he studied medicine from 1920 to 1924. Throughout his time in school, he studied music under Claude Warford, Luigi Parisotti, and Lazar Samoiloff.\n\nParagraph 19: Cleaver began his undergraduate studies at Antioch College in 1962, graduating with a bachelor's degree in economics in 1967. At Antioch, Cleaver became involved in the American Civil Rights Movement and began his lifelong engagement with political activism. From 1964 to 1965, Cleaver studied abroad at the University of Montpellier where he engaged with the Union Nationale des Étudiants de France. In 1967, Cleaver enrolled at Stanford University to begin a PhD in economics. While at Stanford, Cleaver was active in the Anti-war Movement. As a student activist opposed to the Vietnam War, Cleaver protested the Stanford Research Institute's alleged connection to the United States Department of Defense, which became the impetus for his dissertation research into the connections between the Green Revolution and social engineering. Cleaver's frustrations with mainstream economic theory during this period in his studies led him to embrace Marxism.\n\nParagraph 20: Ultimate X-Men was the second comic to debut as part of the Ultimate Marvel line, predated a few months by Ultimate Spider-Man.  Mark Millar reinvented the X-Men with the first X-Men film (which debuted seven months before) as his only reference.  The plot of \"The Tomorrow People\" was what Millar had in mind for the first X-Men film, and \"Return to Weapon X\" would have been the plot to the sequel. As in the film, Millar's original X-Men consisted of telepath Professor X, Cyclops (whose eyes shoot concussive beams) telepath/telekinetic Jean Grey, weather-manipulating Storm, simian genius Beast, metal-skinned Colossus, and cryokinetic Iceman. In its first year, the series was the best-selling comic book of 2001.\n\nParagraph 21: The first Catholic parish church in New York City was St. Peter's on Barclay Street, the cornerstone of which was laid in 1785. By the early 19th century, the Jesuit rector of that church, Anthony Kohlmann, realized that the city's growing Catholic population needed both a second sanctuary and a cathedral for the first bishop, since the city had been made a see in 1808. The site he selected for the new church was being used as a cemetery for St. Peter's, and was well outside the settled area of the city, surrounded by farmland and the country houses of the rich. The architect chosen was Joseph-Francois Mangin, who had co-designed New York's City Hall with John McComb Jr., construction on which was ongoing when the cornerstone of St. Patrick's was laid on June 8, 1809. Construction took just under six years, with the sanctuary being dedicated on May 14, 1815. In that same year, John Connolly, an Irish Dominican friar, arrived to take office as the city's first resident bishop. The church, which was the largest in the city at the time it was built, now measures 120 by 80 feet and the inner vault is 85 feet high (37m x 24m x 26m).\n\nParagraph 22: The sculpture has been used as a backdrop in commercial films, notably in the 2006 Hollywood film The Break-Up, which had to reshoot several scenes because the sculpture was under cover for the initial filming. It is also prominently featured in the ending scene of Source Code. Director Duncan Jones felt the structure was a metaphor for the movie's subject matter and aimed for it to be shown at the beginning and end of the movie. The sculpture served as an aesthetic and symbolic setting for the 2012 film The Vow when the lead characters share a kiss under it. It also appears in the video to \"Homecoming\", a song by Chicago native Kanye West, featuring Chris Martin of the band Coldplay. The sculpture is also featured in the 2008 mumblecore film Nights and Weekends. It was also featured in the Bollywood film Dhoom 3 and the 2014 movie Transformers: Age of Extinction, the fourth installment in the Transformers series. A modified reproduction of Cloud Gate is also included in Watch Dogs, a video game released in 2014 that takes place in Chicago. Unlike the real sculpture, the in-game replica is a curved, white torus. A movement to Windex the Bean was started in 2017, gaining the attention of over thirty thousand people on Facebook. The event took place on November 15, 2017, because of a consensus that the Bean is dirty and needs to be cleaned.Cloud Gate plays a prominent role in Battle Ground, the 17th title in the Dresden Files urban fantasy novel series by Jim Butcher. In the Chicago of the novels, the sculpture was commissioned by Queen Mab, ruler of the Winter Court of Faerie, and proves to be hiding a large stockpile of armaments. Its placement by the Winter Court was in anticipation of a massive supernatural attack on the city of Chicago.\n\nParagraph 23: The first historically documented evidence of Fornaci goes back to approximately 1000AD. The ancient village took the name of Caterozzo, today just the name of one of the four districts of Fornaci. Probably the name comes from “cala” meaning water and “tur” meaning passage, which joined together means ford, describing the original swampy territory on which the first village rose, frequently flooded by the Serchio river. The population was constituted from farmers, fishermen and breeders of cattle who traded their products with the Versiliesi (traders from Versilia, the coastal region of Tuscany) in exchange for spices. A war between the citizens of Lucca and Pope Gregory IX (1230) caused the exodus of the population of Caterozzo and some of the nearby villages to the Apennine mountains. The activity of the \"Caterozzo’s Furnaces\" which took advantage of the rich deposits of clay, increased in the first half of the 15th century. The village was increasingly becoming, around the various brick-kilns, what would be the centre of today’s Fornaci vecchia. Ancient documents mention the castle of Catarozzo, a sign that the village was protected by castle walls, no trace of which remain today . Thanks to the \"Furnaces of Caterozzo\" families the pieve of Loppia, of which only the perimeter walls, the facade and the apse remained, was reconstructed and in 1522 was reopened to the faithful. As the village evolved its name changed to become the present one. Of the ancient brick-kilns only one survives to the present day, completely restored and transformed into a shopping centre. The main expansion of the village happened, however, during the first world war thanks to the building, in 1915, of a branch of Societa’ Metallurgica Italiana belonging to the Orlando Group, an ammunition factory that provided jobs to thousands of people. As a consequence many new houses had to be built for the workers, which resulted in the Fornaci of the present day. Today the factory has lost a large part of its original purpose and has become specialized in the working of copper and its alloys. In the first years of the present century, with the advent of the euro, the factory, today called KME Group, started to produce coins. Consequently the village is now called “Fornaci, the village where the euro is born”. These days the village has become enriched by many shops and has become the commercial centre of the Serchio valley and its Garfagnana neighbour.\n\nParagraph 24: The first game in the series originally launched for the Super NES, F-Zero was also the first game for the platform to use a technique that Nintendo called \"Mode 7 Scrolling\". When Mode 7 was combined with scaling and positioning of the layer on a scanline-by-scanline basis it could simulate 3D environments. Such techniques in games were considered to be revolutionary in a time when most console games were restricted to static/flat backgrounds and 2-dimensional (2D) objects. The result was developer Nintendo EAD creating a game that IGN reviewer Craig Harris called the fastest and smoothest pseudo-3D console racer of its time.F-Zero was one of the launch titles for the SNES that Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development had approximately fifteen months to develop completely. In Japan, only it and Super Mario World were initially available for launch. In North America and Europe, Super Mario World shipped with the console, and other initial titles included F-Zero, Pilotwings (which also demonstrated the console's \"Mode 7\" pseudo-3D rendering capability), SimCity, and Gradius III. F-Zero later had a sequel for the SNES that was canceled, but was released unfinished through the Satellaview peripheral under the name \"BS F-Zero Grand Prix\". Takaya Imamura, who worked directly on F-Zero throughout its different incarnations, said in 2003 \"hav[ing] worked on the F-Zero series, and seeing the results of the collaboration with Sega, I found myself at something of a loss as to how we can take the franchise further past F-Zero GX and AX\". \n\nParagraph 25: Following Jeremy's eviction, the HouseGuests competed in the \"Big Brother Royalty\" Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were asked to determine which HouseGuest best fit a description based on how the viewers had voted in an online poll. A HouseGuest was eliminated for an incorrect answer, with the last HouseGuest remaining becoming the winner. Judd was the winner. In a twist this week, the viewers became the M.V.P. for the week and voted for the third nominee; the HouseGuests were not informed of this twist. On Day 29, HouseGuests competed in the \"Funky Froyo\" Have-Not competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were weighed before the start of the competition, and were then required to eat as much frozen yogurt as possible. The team that had gained the least amount of weight would become the Have-Nots for the week. The team of Andy, Candice, Jessie, and Spencer became the Have-Nots for the week. Much like the previous week, Amanda continued to campaign for Howard to be nominated and evicted, though Judd feared a girls alliance was in the house and opted to keep Howard safe. That same night, Judd nominated Aaryn and Kaitlin for eviction. Following this, GinaMarie, Howard, Judd, Kaitlin, and Spencer formed a new alliance in an attempt to go against Amanda, Elissa, Helen, and McCrae, who they felt were running the house. On Day 30, it was revealed that Elissa had been nominated for eviction by the viewers. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Helen and McCrae were selected to compete for the Power of Veto; Andy was selected to host. That same day, HouseGuests competed in the \"Big Brother Election\" Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests dug through mud to find envelopes filled with \"votes\", and votes that were higher in value required HouseGuests to take punishments in exchange for points. The HouseGuest with the most points would be the winner. Elissa was the winner of the Power of Veto, while McCrae won a $5,000 prize. Helen, as a punishment, was required to be in bed early each night, while Judd had twenty-four hours in solitary confinement while being woken up by an alarm clock every nine minutes. Elissa, as part of another punishment, gave up the right to participate in the following Power of Veto competition. On Day 32, Elissa used the Power of Veto to remove herself from the block, with GinaMarie being nominated in her place. Though a plan was made to evict Kaitlin from the house, Elissa later informed Kaitlin of this and attempted to turn the house against Aaryn. Her attempts backfired, however, and led to a huge confrontation between Elissa and several other HouseGuests who soon lost their trust in her. On Day 35, Kaitlin became the fourth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house when she received nine eviction votes (9-0-0).\n\nParagraph 26: The male advertises several potential nest sites to his mate by singing at the entrance, slipping inside and so on, with the female finally selecting one. The typical nest site of a tawny owl is a tree hollow, wherein the owls will nest directly on the interior hole's surface. Tree hollows used may be as much as  above the ground, but are usually within about  of the ground. Virtually any species of deciduous tree may be used provided holes are available. These tree cavities may be of any origin, with trees that grow large such as oak, beech, poplar, maple, lime, hornbeam and alder often regularly utilized. Female may scratch out a shallow base in soil if present and sometimes seen to reportedly tear eggs into pieces as a cushion from their broods. Other tree nest locations have included those on top of a Witch's broom and on top of the tree canopy. Natural holes in trees are often the most frequently used nesting site, followed closely in recent decades many artificial nest boxes, preferably those with a  entrance or larger. Of the nest boxes erected in different parts from Kielder forest and the Glenbranter forest of Argyll, 592 nest boxes were placed at  high along the side of trees and 17.4% of which were used by tawnys (in latter 2 years of study up to 24.1%). In southeastern Scotland, all nest boxes erected in habitat were eventually utilized by tawny owls. Many nest boxes were recorded to be used as roost sites in the Milan, with only 12.3% of the 44% of nest boxes actually used by owls for breeding, usually with the owls utilizing boxes that were at least  above the ground. Nest boxes are most successful wherever natural tree cavities are scarce or absent, such as conifer forests, young successional woods and farmlands. Tawny owls may not infrequently nest in an unmodified black woodpecker hole. This species may too nest in nest of larger birds such as crows, common ravens (Corvus corax) and Eurasian magpies as well as common buzzards, black kites, northern goshawks and various eagles while the sometimes recorded as used smaller nests such as those of Eurasian jays, Eurasian sparrowhawks and common wood pigeons but these are at potential risk of collapse.  Occasionally, tawny owls have also been recorded nesting in abandoned burrows of larger mammals (e.g. red fox and European badger (Meles meles) as well as those of rabbits). Other nesting locations recorded for the species have included bare cliff ledges, between the roots of heavy tree trunks, on the bare forest floor and among heather. Also rarer still nests have been reported in the recesses of stone walls, in chimneys of large buildings, on cabins and sheds, in dovecotes and church towers. In southern Finland, 95% of 123 nest boxes put out were occupied by tawny owls in 1970–1975, natural tree hole use decreased in same period from 48% to 3%, on top of stumps from 4% to 1% and in buildings from 15% to 1%.\n\nParagraph 27: Fauré, G.

It compares this technique to other confocal laser microscopy techniques and explains that two-photon excitation microscopy does not use pinhole apertures for optical sectioning like confocal microscopes do. Instead, the optical sectioning in two-photon microscopy is a result of the point spread function of the excitation, which has a dumbbell-shaped pattern. The concept of two-photon excitation is based on the idea that two lower-energy photons can excite a molecule, resulting in the emission of a higher-energy fluorescence photon. Though the probability of the near-simultaneous absorption of two photons is low, a high peak flux of excitation photons is typically used. The advantage of using two-photon excitation is that it improves the extent along the z dimension, allowing for thin optical sections to be cut. Additionally, the longer wavelength, lower energy lasers used in two-photon microscopy cause less damage to live cells, making it suitable for imaging over longer periods without toxic effects.\n\nPlease enter the number of the paragraph that the abstract is from.

Approximately 5.2 million people of 65 and older are suffered with any form of cognitive impairments in United States in 2012 \\cite{stat12}. Dementia is one of the major causes of the cognitive impairments which is more acute among 85 and older population (50\\%) \\cite{stat12}. However, the costs (financial and time) of health care and long-term care for individuals with Alzheimer's (special form of dementia) or other dementias are substantial. For example, during 2016, about 15.9 million family and friends in United States provided 18.2 billion hours of unpaid assistance to those with cognitive impairments which is a contribution to the nation valued at \\$230.1 billion. One the other hand, total payments for all individuals with all form of cognitive impairments are estimated at \\$259 billion. Total annual payments for health care, long-term care and hospice care for people with Alzheimer's or other dementias are projected to increase from \\$259 billion in 2017 to more than \\$1.1 trillion in 2050. Among the above costs, a significant amount are relevant to clinical and diagnostic tests \\cite{stat17}. Although clinical and diagnostic tests have become more precise in identifying dementia, studies have shown that there is a high degree of underrecognition especially in early detection. However, there are many advantages to obtaining an early and accurate diagnosis when cognitive symptoms are first noticed as the root cause findings of impairment always lessen the progress of impairment status and sometimes symptoms can be reversible and cured.\n\nWith the proliferation of emerging ubiquitous computing technologies, many mobile and wearable devices have been available to capture continuous functional and physiological behavior of older adults. Wearable sensors are now capable of estimating number of steps being taken, physical activity levels, sleep patterns and physiological outcomes (heart rate, skin conductance) of older adults \\cite{sano15}. Ambient sensors also help capture the movement patterns of objects and humans for activity and behavior recognition \\cite{dawadi14,dawadi15}. Researchers also proved the existence of correlations between cognitive impairment and everyday task performance \\cite{dawadi14, akl15,alam16} as well as physiological symptoms \\cite{alam16,sano15}. Although current studies showed some successes in IoT-assisted cognitive health assessment in different domains individually, there are several existing challenges in developing and validating a fully automated multi-modal assessment model.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\emph{Real-time IoT System}: A real-time IoT system must include a continuous and fault tolerant data streaming capability among central hub, wearable sensors and ambient sensors regardless of network communication protocol (WiFi, Ethernet, Bluetooth etc.) which are not available in existing researches.\n\\item \\emph{Multi-modal Context Fusion}: Though several offline clinically validated cognitive health assessment tools exist \\cite{wai03, starling99, krapp07, yesavage82, zung71}, there is no universally accepted method for IoT-assisted automatic cognitive health assessment in smart home environment that can fuse multi-modal sensor contexts altogether. For example, some researchers showed ambient sensors based Activities of Daily Livigin (ADLs) sequence pattern can signify the cognitive health status of older adults \\cite{akl15, dawadi15}. Researchers also showed wearable Electrodermal Activity pattern analysis may carry the significance of cognitive status \\cite{sano15}. However, for validation of IoT based cognitive health assessment, self-reported surveys, clinical diagnosis and observation based tools are used individually by prior researchers \\cite{akl15, dawadi15, sano15, alam16}.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nRegarding aforementioned challenges for the automation of cognitive health assessment, \\emph{AutoCogniSys} considers (i) reproducibility of our model in any smart home system consists of ambient motion sensors, wearable accelerometer (ACC) sensors, wearable Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors individually or combined streams; (ii) context awareness based on ambient motion sensors and wearable ACC sensors in any types of activities such as hand gestural, postural and complex ADLs; and (iii) high accuracy, i.e., a recall rate of over 90\\% with less than 5\\% false positive rate. More specifically, \\emph{AutoCogniSys} extends our existing work \\cite{alam16} in three dimensions,\n\n\\emph{(1) True Automation:} We first investigate the correlations of cognitive impairment with human activities and stress where we manually labeled activities, extract the corresponding physiological sensor (EDA and PPG) features of each activity, and use statistical method to find correlations. Then, we propose automatic complex activity recognition based on a Hierarchical Dynamic Bayesian Network (HDBN) model, fine-grained extraction of physiological sensor features and finally machine learning classification of cognitive impairment.\n\n\\emph{(2) Noises Elimination:} We define different types of noises on ACC, EDA and PPG sensors, propose extensive signal processing techniques to remove noises and show significant improvement can be achieved in cognitive impairment classification.\n\n\\emph{(3) Implementation and Evaluation:} Finally, we design and implement IoT system and analytic methods and minimize the human involvement to automate our proposed cognitive health assessment approach by considering effective smart home sensor customization and deployment, data collection, screening, cleaning and filtering, feature computation, normalization and classification, and activity  model training.\n\n\\textbf{Research Questions:} \\emph{AutoCogniSys} consequently tackles the following key research questions.\n\n$\\bullet$ Can we detect simultaneously the periodic rhythms of  both hand gestures and postural activities from wrist-worn ACC sensor signal for diverse population (population with same activity but diverse ways such as walking with walker, stretcher or normally)? If so, how can we incorporate the hand gesture, posture and ambient sensor data streams to help improve the ADLs recognition models?\n\n$\\bullet$ How can we exploit and relate the micro-activity features into noise free physiological sensor signals processing to automate cognitive health assessment process? What are the critical roles of clinical survey and technology guided assessment methodologies and their inter-relationships for automating the different intermediate steps of cognitive health assessment process?\n\nTo tackle these, we make the following \\textbf{key contributions}:\n\n$\\bullet$ We employ an extensive signal deconvolution technique that in conjunction with machine learning technique helps facilitate a wrist-worn ACC-based multi-label (hand gestural and postural) activity recognition for diverse population. We then leverage multi-label context sets with ambient and object sensor signals for complex activity recognition based on HDBN model.\n\n$\\bullet$ We propose a novel collaborative filter for EDA signal processing by postulating signal as a mixture of three components: \\emph{tonic phase, phasic phase} and \\emph{motion artifacts}, and employ convex optimization technique for filtering out the motion artifacts. We also propose a novel PPG signal processing technique to filter out the inherent motion artifacts and noises using improved Periodic Moving Average Filtering (PMAF) technique.\n\n$\\bullet$  We design and prototype an IoT system consisting of multiple devices (wearable wrist band, IP camera, object and ambient sensors) connected with central hub via WiFi, Ethernet and Bluetooth communication protocols. We collected data from 22 older adults living in a continuing care retirement community center in a very natural setting (IRB \\#HP-00064387).\n\n$\\bullet$ Finally, we employ statistical and machine learning techniques to jointly correlate the activity performance metrics and stress (EDA and PPG) features that helps achieve max. 93\\% of cognitive impairment status detection accuracy. We evaluate \\emph{AutoCogniSys} on 5 clinically validated offline assessment tools as ground truth.\n\\section{Related Works}\n\\emph{AutoCogniSys} builds on previous works on wearable devices based low-level (postural and hand gestural) activity recognition and their integration with ambient sensors to recognize complex ADLs, the underlying signal processing and applications on cognitive health assessment automation.\n\\subsection{Wearable Sensor Signal Processing}\nWearable sensors can be two types: physical and physiological. Physical sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope etc.) signal values change over the movements of the sensor devices. Physiological sensors change over physiological condition of body such as EDA changes over stress and PPG changes over heart rate. However, physical movements also impose noises on physiological sensor signals which is called \\emph{motion artifacts}.\n\\subsubsection{Physiological Signal Processing}\nA continuous and descrete decomposition of EDA, and time and frequency domain analytics of PPG signal have been investigated before to extract relevant physiological features which were contaminated with noises and motion artifacts \\cite{alam16}. \\cite{setz10} denoised and classified EDA from cognitive load and stress with accuracy higher than 80\\%. Though motion artifacts removal techniques such as exponential smoothing \\cite{hern11} and low-pass filters \\cite{poh10, hernandez14} provide significant improvement in filtering EDA signals, wavelet transforms offer more sophisticated refinement for any kind of physiological sensors such as electroencephalogram \\cite{krish06, zikov02}, electrocardiogram \\cite{erc06,alfa08}, and PPG \\cite{lee03}. \\cite{chen15} proposed a stationary wavelet transform (SWT) based motion artifacts removal technique. `cvxEDA' proposed  a convex optimization technique considering EDA as a mixture of white gaussian noise, tonic and phasic components where white gaussian noise includes motion artifacts and external noises \\cite{greco16}. \\emph{AutoCogniSys} intelligently combines SWT and `cvxEDA' together to remove noises and motion artifacts from EDA signal. On the other hand, it is more difficult to remove motion artifacts from PPG signal due to its periodicity of nature \\cite{wang13}. Researchers proposed different methods such as frequency analytics \\cite{garde13,wang13}, statistical analytics \\cite{peng14} and digital filter \\cite{lee10} to reduce noises and motion artifacts from PPG. \\emph{AutoCogniSys} used Periodic Moving Average Filter (PMAF) in this regard \\cite{lee07}.\n\\subsubsection{Physical Sensor Signal Processing}\nACC based hand gesture recognition has been explored by several researchers in past such as discrete hidden markov model \\cite{liu10}, artificial neural network \\cite{arce11}, weighted naive bayes and dynamic time warping \\cite{mace13}. Akl et. al. proposed 18 gesture dictionary based Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier \\cite{akl11}. Wrist-worn ACC based postural activity recognition approach has been proposed using Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes and deep neural networks \\cite{gj14, wang16}, the accuracy stagnates at 85\\% using SVM method \\cite{martin16}. However, neither of past works proposed any technique that can provide single body worn ACC sensor-based multiple body contexts recognition nor works efficiently for diverse posture say walking normally, with walker, with double walker or wheel chair. Our proposed 8-hand gesture recognition technique assisted sparse-deconvolution method improves classification performances on both normal and diverse postures. However, we incorporated hand gestures and postures in conjunction with ambient sensors into single-inhabitant HDBN model \\cite{alam16b} that provides significant improvement in complex activity recognition.\n\\subsection{Cognitive Health Assessment}\nSmart home environment has been used for providing automated health monitoring and assessment in the ageing population before \\cite{dawadi14, gong15, akl15, dawadi15}. `SmartFABER' proposed a non-intrusive sensor network based continuous smart home environmental sensor data acquisition and a novel hybrid statistical and knowledge-based technique to analyz the data to estimate behavioral anomalies for early detection of mild-cognitively impairment \\cite{riboni16}. \\cite{skubic15} presented an example of unobtrusive, continuous monitoring system for the purpose of assessing early health changes to alert caregivers about the potential signs of health hazards. Though, prior researches proposed a sequence of ambient motion sensor streams as complex activity components in activity based health assessment \\cite{dawadi14, gong15, akl15, dawadi15}, we consider inclusion of an wearable wrist-band with in-built ACC sensor to detect hand gesture and posture, augmenting with the ambient sensor readings to help recognize complex activities as well as cognitive health assessment of older adults. Additionally, we propose intelligent use of physiological features of skin through different physiological sensor signals (EDA, PPG) processing in daily activity tasks and incorporate context-awareness for automation of cognitive health assessment that have not been explored before.\n\\begin{figure}[!htb]\n\\begin{center}\n   \\epsfig{file=flowchart.pdf,height=1.6in, width=3.5in}\n\\caption{Overall flow of \\emph{AutoCogniSys} pipeline.}\n   \\label{fig:overview}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\\section{Overall Architecture}\nWe first investigate existing IoT-based cognitive health care frameworks that covers every aspects of wearable (physical, physiological) and ambient (passive infrared and object) sensor signals computing. \\emph{AutoCogniSys} is comprised of three component modules: (i)~sensing, (ii)~processing, and (iii)~analysis. The `sensing' module consists of clinical assessment tools (surveys, observation and clinical backgrounds) and sensing signals (ambient and wearable sensors). `Sensor processing' module is comprised of three sub-modules: a)~clinical assessment feature extraction from assessment tools; b)~ambient sensor feature extraction; and c)~wearable sensor processing (noise removal, segmentation, feature extraction, classification etc.). `Analysis' module is comprised of machine learning and statistical analytics-based score prediction of cognitive impairment. Automation of each module's functionality and inter-intra modular transactions without human interference can be called {\\it true automation} of cognitive health assessment. Fig.~\\ref{fig:overview} shows the overall flow of \\emph{AutoCogniSys} which is discussed in details in the following sections.\n\\subsection{Demographic Ground Truth Data Collection}\nCurrently in standard clinical practice and research, the most accurate evaluations of cognitive health assessment are one-to-one observation and supervision tasks/questionnaires for monitoring an individual's functional abilities and behavior \\cite{resnick15}. In the first stage of this pilot study, we have investigated current literatures and carefully chosen the clinically proven functional and behavioral health assessment survey tools \\cite{resnick15}. On the other hand, to cross check with the survey based evaluations, we have also chosen clinically justified observation based behavioral assessment methods. First, following the resident consent, our clinical research evaluator collects demographic and descriptive data (age, gender, race, ethnicity, marital status, education and medical commodities). She has performed two types of clinical assessments: (1) \\emph{Observation based} where the resident's cognition is assessed using the Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS) scale \\cite{wai03}. (2) \\emph{Survey based} where five widely used and clinically well validated surveys are taken into account: (a) \\emph{Yale Physical Activity Survey} \\cite{starling99}; (b) \\emph{Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living}; (c) \\emph{Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living} \\cite{krapp07}; (d) \\emph{Geriatric Depression Rating scale} \\cite{yesavage82}; and (e) \\emph{Zung Self-Rating Anxiety scale} \\cite{zung71}.\n\\subsection{Smart Environment Creation}\nFor an ideal IoT-based system, instrumenting and deploying it at each participant's natural living environment warrants for assembling a flexible set of hardware and software interfaces to ease the system configuration, setup, and network discovery processes. The sensor system placed in the residences of volunteers needs to meet several specific physiological signals and activity monitoring needs. However, we must confirm that the devices are reliable with potential for re-deployment as well as appear unintimidating to the participants. Inspired by the above requirements, we developed a real testbed IoT system, {\\it SenseBox}, by customizing Cloud Engine PogoPlug Mobile base station firmware to integrate with WiFi (connect ambient and object sensors) and Bluetooth (connect wristband) protocol. The smart home components are as follows: (i) PogoPlug base server with a continuous power supply, (ii) 3 binary Passive Infrared sensors in three different rooms (kitchen, livingroom and bedroom) to capture room level occupancy, (iii) 7 binary object sensors attached with closet door, entry door, telephone, broom, laundry basket, trash can and trash box, (iv) three IP cameras in the appropriate positions to collect the ground truth data and (v) an Empatica E4 \\cite{empatica} wrist-band (integrated sensors: PPG at 64 Hz, EDA at 4 Hz, Body temperature at 1 Hz and a triaxial ACC at 32 Hz) on the participant's dominating hand.\n\\section{Activity Recognition}\nWe aim to detect single wrist-worn ACC sensor based hand gesture and postural activities and insert these into an HDBN graphical model in conjunction with ambient and object sensor values for complex activity recognition. We consider the recognition problem asan activity tupple of $\\langle gesture,posture,ambient,object \\rangle$. Though, Alam et. al. provides significant performance improvement for single wrist-worn ACC sensor aided 18-hand gesture based postural activity recognition in lab environment \\cite{alam17}, it faces some practical challenges in real-time smart environment with older adults due to the diversity of their postures. For example, some older adults use walker, double walking sticks or wheel chair for walking in which cases collecting 18 hand gestures and corresponding postural activities for training requires endless efforts and carefulness. To reduce the complexity of ground truth labeling and later state space explosion for graphical model (HDBN), we propose to use rotational normalization method that can merge some hand-gestures subject to directional differences and forms an 8-hand gesture model. However, our proposed Feature Weight Naive Bayes (FWNB) classifier adds significant improvement on Alam et. al. proposed sparse-deconvolution method as well as recognition in diverse postural environment.\n\\begin{figure}[!htb]\n\\begin{center}\n   \\epsfig{file=hand_gestures.pdf,height=0.5in, width=3in}\n   \\vspace{-.2in}\n\\caption{8 hand gesture dictionary with direction}\n   \\label{fig:hand_gestures}\n   \\vspace{-.2in}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\\subsection{Hand Gesture Recognition}\n\\label{sec:hand_gesture}\n\\emph{AutoCogniSys} proposes an 8-gesture dictionary (as shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:hand_gestures}) and a Feature Weighted Naive Bayesian (FWNB) framework for building, modeling and recognizing hand gestures. The method comprises of the following steps: (i) \\emph{Preprocessing:} wrist-worn ACC sensor provided 3-axis data are passed through 0.4Hz low-pass filter to remove the data drift. (ii) \\emph{Rotation normalization:} Normalizing the rotation of hand gestures provides greater accuracy and allows for more realistic, orientation-independent motion. At first, we find the best fit plane of the acceleration vectors thus if the motion lies in a single plane, then the acceleration vectors of a closed shape should on average lie in that main plane. Then, we take all acceleration segments between points of inflection to form one single vector called reference vector that provides us the general direction of user's motion. After that, each vector is normalized relative to the reference vector. This normalization helps remove a lot of hand gestures from prior considered 18 hand gestures resulting a reduced dictionary of 8 gestures. (iii) \\emph{Feature Weighted Naive Bayesian model:} Naive Bayes classifier is light-weight and efficient technique for hand gesture recognition. We extract 12 ACC features \\cite{alam17} and calculate weight for each feature type based on the similarity of feature measures of the trained gestures (0$<$weight$<$1). While recognizing gestures, the proximity of each feature measure to the average trained feature measure of each gesture type is calculated by a normal distribution. Then, the proximity value is multiplied by the feature weight that was calculated in the training phase.  All of these multiplied values are added together and the system predicts the gesture type with the greatest value as the user gesture. In the learning data points, there should be static postural activities (such as sitting, lying etc.) to avoid unexpected noises over wrist-worn ACC sensors. In the final hand gesture dictionary, we save the reference vector as our signal dictionary.\n\\subsection{Postural Activity Recognition}\nIn normal lab environment, wrist-worn ACC sensor signal is a mixture (convolution) of actual hand gesture and postural activity relevant signals \\cite{alam17}. \\emph{AutoCogniSys} improves the idea by reducing the number of hand gestures and postural activities to 8 (as shown in Fig.\\ref{fig:hand_gestures}) using rotation normalization and 4 (walking, sitting, standing and lying). Then, we use sparse-deconvolution method (with 31\\% signal reconstruction error) to get Approximately Sparse Factor. The summary of the entire process is stated bellow:\n\n{\\it Building Deconvolution Method:} We first consider the wrist-worn ACC sensor signals (3-axis values) as a convolution of hand gesture and postural activity effects and build a deconvolution framework. The deconvolution framework takes a known signal (hand gesture effects) and a equalizer parameter ($\\lambda$) as input and provides an Approximately Sparse Factor signal (postural activity effects) as output. For 3-axis ACC signals, we need to learn associated 3 equalizer parameters for each hand gesture. Moreover, each equalizer parameter is involved with 4 postural activities that results a total 96 ($8\\times 3\\times 4$) equalizer parameters to learn. \n\n{\\it Learning Classification Model:} We use the Approximately Sparse Factor signal to extract 12 statistical features and SVM with sequential machine optimization (SMO) \\cite{cao06} for postural activity recognition.\n\n{\\it Prediction Model:} After recognizing the hand gestures following the method explained in Sec.~\\ref{sec:hand_gesture}, we take the corresponding reference vector as known signal and extract the Approximately Sparse Factor signals incorporating corresponding 3 equalizer parameters ($\\lambda$) for the sparse-deconvolution method. Then, we apply feature extraction and prior learned SMO based SVM classifier \\cite{cao06} to classify final postural activity. Fig.~\\ref{fig:deconvolution} illustrates a single axis example of the deconvolution.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!htb]\n\\begin{center}\n\n   \\epsfig{file=deconvolution.pdf,height=1.6in, width=3in}\n   \\vspace{-.15in}\n\\caption{Sample deconvolution example of X-axis. The raw x-axis of accelerometer signal, reference vector of the sample gesture and the extracted corresponding ASF signal of walking.}\n   \\label{fig:deconvolution}\n\\end{center}\n\\vspace{-.15in}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Complex Activity Recognition}\nWe build a HDBN based complex activity recognition framework for single inhabitant scenario smart home environment \\cite{alam16b} taking the advantage of detected hand gestural and postural activities along with the ambient and object sensor streams. At first, we obtain instant hand gestural and postural activities from our above proposed models, and additionally motion sensor and object sensor readings from our IoT-system for every time instant generating a 4-hierarchy of HDBN model. Considering the context set $\\langle gestural, postural, ambient,object\\rangle$ as a hierarchical activity structure (extending two 2-hierarchical HDBN \\cite{alam16b}), we build complex activity recognition model for single inhabitant scenario. Finally, we infer the most-likely sequence of complex activities (and their time boundaries), utilizing the well-known Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm \\cite{dempster77} for training and the Viterbi algorithm \\cite{forney73} for run-time inference.\n\\section{Automatic Activity Features Estimation}\nThe effects of cognitive ability on daily activity performance have been studied before \\cite{dawadi14,akl15}. They experimentally and clinically validated that cognitive impairment highly reduces the daily activity performances and this activity performance can be computed as an indicator of cognitive ability status of older adults. The standard activity features refer to completeness of task (TC), sequential task ability (SEQ), interruption avoidance capabilities (INT) etc. In current behavioral science literature, the above activity features carry specific definition based on the sub-tasks involved with a complex activity \\cite{dawadi14,akl15}. Completeness of task refers to how many sub-tasks are missed by the participants. Sequential task ability refers to how many sequences of sub-tasks are missed referring the gerontologist defined standard sequences of the sub-task for the particular complex activity. Interruption avoidance capability refers to how many times the participants stop or interleave while doing any sub-task. The final goal of activity features estimation is to provide overall task score. The task score is proportional to the functional ability of participants in performance daily activities. Our behavioral scientist team, comprises with Nursing professor, gerontologist and retirement community caregivers, carefully discus, optimize and choose 87 sub-tasks in total for 13 complex activities.\n\nEach of the sub-task comprises with sequential occurrences of hand gesture and postural activities. However, no researchers ever considered hand gesture for activity features estimation due to complexity of multi-modal wearable and ambient sensors synchronization and multi-label activity classification \\cite{dawadi14,akl15}. \\emph{AutoCogniSys} exploited single wrist-worn sensor based hand gesture and postural activity recognition, and proposed an activity features (TC, SEQ and INT) estimation method including these two parameters in conjunction with object and ambient sensor features that provide significant improvement of cognitive health assessment of older adults.\n\\subsection{Machine Learning Based Complex Activity Features Estimation}\nIn current cognitive health assessment literature, complex activity features can be defined as $\\langle TC,SEQ,INT,TS\\rangle$. We used supervised method to estimate TC, SEQ and INT, and unsupervised method to estimate TS. We first, formulate the automated scoring as a supervised  machine learning problem in which machine learning algorithms learn a function that maps $\\langle${\\it hand gesture, posture, object, ambient sensor}$\\rangle$ feature set to the direct observation scores. We use bagging ensemble method to learn the mapping function and SMO based SVM \\cite{cao06} as base classifier. The learner averages by boostrapping individual numeric predictions to combine the base classifier predictions and generates an output for each data point that corresponds to the highest-probability label. We train three classifiers considering observation as ground truth for TC, SEQ and INT scores and test on the testing dataset. We derive unsupervised scores using dimensionality reduction technique for each feature set. First, we take all features of each activity, apply optimal discriminant analysis technique as a dimensionality reduction process \\cite{zhang09} and reduce the feature sets into single dimensional value which represents the automated task completeness scores of the particular user activity. A min-max normalization is applied that provides us a uniform range of the variables using $\nz_i=\\frac{x_i-min(x)}{max(x)-min(x)}$ equation where $x=\\{x1,\\ldots,x_n\\}$ and $z_i$ is $i^{th}$ normalized data. The final single dimensional score represents machine learning based TS score.\n\\section{Physiological Sensor Signals Processing}\nThe autonomic nervous system (ANS) restrains the body's physiological activities including the heart rate, skin gland secretion, blood pressure, and respiration. The ANS is divided into sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) branches. While SNS actuates the body's resources for action under arousal conditions, PNS attenuates the body to help regain the steady state. Mental arousal (say stress, anxiety etc.) activates the sweat gland causing the increment and reduction of  Skin Conductance on SNS and PNS physiological conditions respectively. However, Instant Heart Rate also has similar effect on SNS and PNS physiological condtions i.e., a higher value of heart rate is the effect of SNS and lower value is the outcome of PNS. EDA and PPG sensors are widely used to estimate the instant value of skin conductance and heart rate respectively \\cite{alam16}.\n\\subsection{EDA Sensor Signal Processing}\nEDA is the property of the human body that causes continuous variation in the electrical characteristics of the skin which varies with the state of sweat glands in the skin. There are three types of arousal: \\emph{cognitive, affective and physical}. \\emph{Cognitive} arousal occurs when a person tries to solve any problem using her cognitive ability. \\emph{Affective} arousal occurs when a person is worried, frightened or angry either doing daily activities or in resting position. On the other hand, \\emph{physical} arousal is related to the brain command to move bodily parts which is imposed on the total arousal as an artifact, called \\emph{motion artifact}. However, there are always some noises due to the weather conditions (temperature, humidity etc.) and device motion. This \\emph{motion artifact} can be the prime cause of signal contamination of physiological outcomes while performing daily activities which must be removed. \\emph{AutoCogniSys} proposes an EDA sensor signal processing method consists of three steps: (i) noise and motion artifacts removal, (ii) separation of tonic component and phasic component (explained later) from contamination free EDA signal and (iii) feature extraction on the response window.\n\\subsubsection{Motion Artifacts Removal}\nThere are many types of motion artifacts but the unsual steep rise is the mostly occured ones associated with EDA signal while performing daily activities \\cite{edel67}. We use well-known steep rising noises reduction technique, SWT \\cite{chen15}. We first consider EDA signal as a mixture of a slow variant tonic and fast variant phasic component, i.e., SWT coefficient is modeled as a mixture of two Gaussian components, phasic (close to zero valued signal) and tonic (high rising signal). After expanding EDA signal into multiple levels of scaling and wavelet coefficients, we choose adaptively a threshold limit at each level based on the statistical estimation of the wavelet coefficients' distribution, and employ that on the wavelet coefficients of all levels. Finally, an inverse wavelet transform technique is applied to the thresholded wavelet coefficients to obtain the artifacts free EDA signal. Fig~.\\ref{fig:eda_artifact_removal} shows a sample of raw and motion artifacts free EDA signal.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!htb]\n\\begin{center}\n\\vspace{-.1in}\n   \\epsfig{file=eda_signal_artifact.pdf,height=1.6in, width=3.5in}\n\\caption{Dashed line represents noisy EDA signal and solid red line represents \\emph{AutoCogniSys} proposed motion artifact free EDA signal}\n   \\label{fig:eda_artifact_removal}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\\subsubsection{Convex Optimization Technique to EDA Deconvolution}\nAfter the motion artifact removal, we consider EDA as the sum of three components for $N$ sample: a slow tonic driver ($t$), fast (compact, bursty) non-negative sparse phasic driver ($r$) and a reminder error term ($\\epsilon_r$).\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:eda_signal}\ny = t + r + \\epsilon_r\n\\end{equation}\nThis additive error $\\epsilon_r$ is a White Gaussian Noise. The central problem associated with the deconvolution method is to get tonic $t$ component from the above equation. \\cite{greco16} showed that EDA signal deconvolution (separation of tonic, phasic and noise terms from EDA signal) is a quadratic optimization problem and defined tonic component as follows:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:tonic}\nt = Bl + Cd,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $B$ is a tall matrix whose columns are cubic $B$-spline basis functions, $l$ is the vector of spline coefficients, $C$ is a $N\\times 2$ matrix, $d$ is a $2\\times 1$ vector with the offset and slope coefficients for the linear trend. The above equation is subject to the following optimization problem,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nminimize \\frac{1}{2} {||Mq + Bl + Cd- y||}^2_2 +\\alpha {||Aq||}_1 + \\frac{\\lambda}{2} {||l||}^2_2\\\\\nsubject\\;to\\; Aq \\geq 0\\nonumber\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $M$ and $A$ are tridiagonal matrices and $q$ is an auxiliary variable. After solving the above equation, we can get the optimal values for $\\{q,l,d\\}$ that can be used to obtain tonic component from the equation~\\ref{eq:tonic}. The reminder of the equation~\\ref{eq:eda_signal} ($r+\\epsilon_r$) is considered as a mixture of White Gaussian Noise ($\\epsilon_r$) and a fast variant phasic component ($r$). We employ butterworth low-pass filter (5Hz) and hanning smoothing with window size 4 (optimal) to remove $\\epsilon_r$ from phasic component ($r$).\n\\subsection{PPG Signal Processing}\nPPG is used mainly for measuring the oxygen saturation in the blood and blood volume changes in skin. An ideal PPG signal processing must contain the following steps: noise and motion artifacts removal, heart rate detection, heart rate variability estimation and feature extraction.\n\\subsubsection{PPG Signal Noise and Motion Artifacts Removal}\nSimilar to EDA signal, PPG signal is also contaminated with motion artifacts and noises. However, unlike EDA signal, PPG produce quasiperiodicity in a time series spectrum \\cite{mete30}. We use Periodic Moving Average Filter (PMAF) to remove motion artifacts and noises \\cite{lee07}. We first segment the PPG signal on periodic boundaries and then average the $m^{th}$ samples of each period. After filtering the input PPG signal with a 5-Hz $8^{th}$-order Butterworth low-pass filter, we estimate the maximum and minimum value of each period. The mean of each period are obtained from the maximum and minimum values applying the zero crossing method. These points of the means help determine the boundaries of each period. Then, interpolation or decimation is performed to ensure that each period had the same number of samples \\cite{lee07}. \n\\subsubsection{Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability Estimation}\nWe first apply PMAF on PPG signal to remove noises and motion artifacts, refine PPG by smoothing the signal using 1-dimensional Gaussian Filter and Convolution, calculate first derivative of the convoluted signal and finally find the differences between two consecutive peak values which is called HRV \\cite{sel08}. The occurrences of total peak values (R-peak or beat) in each minute is called Heart Rate (HR) with an unit of Beat Per Minute. The signal value property of HRV and HR are inversely proportional which means the mental arousal that increases HR should decrease HRV in the time segment window. Fig~\\ref{fig:ppg_artifact_removal} shows a sample of the noisy and filtered PPG signal and their corresponding Instant Heart Rate.\n\\begin{figure}[!htb]\n\\vspace{-.1in}\n\\begin{center}\n   \\epsfig{file=ppg_artifact_removal.pdf,height=1.4in, width=3.5in}\n   \\vspace{-.15in}\n\\caption{Top figure illustrates the noisy signal (dotted line) and filtered signal from PPG sensor based on our filtering method. Bottom figure illustrates instant heart rate calculated from noisy signal (dotted line) and filtered signal}\n   \\label{fig:ppg_artifact_removal}\n\\end{center}\n\\vspace{-.15in}\n\\end{figure}\n\\subsection{Physiological Sensor Signal Feature Extraction}\nUsing the above mentioned methods, we removed the noises and motion artifacts from EDA and PPG signals and generated two time series signal from EDA (tonic and phasic components) and one time series signal from PPG (HRV). Then, we segment each of the time series signal based on our prior detected complex activities such that each response window starts and ends with the starting and ending points of each complex activity. We extract 7 statistical time-series features for EDA (as shown in Table~\\ref{tab:eda_features}) and 8 features for HRV (Table~\\ref{tab:hrv_features}) within the response window).\n\n\\begin{table}[!t]\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{1}\n\\caption{EDA Features Within The Response Window}\n\\begin{scriptsize}\n\n\n\\label{tab:eda_features}\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}\n\\hline\n\\bfseries Features& \\bfseries Description\\\\\n\\hline\nnSCR & Number of SCRs within response window (wrw)\\\\\n\\hline\nLatency & Response latency of first significant SCR wrw\\\\\n\\hline\nAmpSum & Sum of SCR-amplitudes of significant SCRs wrw\\\\\n\\hline\nSCR & Average phasic driver wrw\\\\\n\\hline\nISCR & Area (i.e. time integral) of phasic driver wrw\\\\\n\\hline\nPhasicMax & Maximum value of phasic activity wrw\\\\\n\\hline\nTonic & Mean tonic activity wrw\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{scriptsize}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{table}\n\n\n\n\\begin{table}[!t]\n  \\begin{center}\n\\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{1}\n\\vspace{-.3in}\n\\caption{Heart Rate Variability features}\n\\label{tab:hrv_features}\n\\begin{scriptsize}\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}\n\n\\hline\n\\bfseries Feature& \\bfseries Description\\\\\n\\hline\n$\\overline{RR}$&Mean RR intervals\\\\\n\\hline\nSDNN&Standard deviation of RR intervals\\\\\n\\hline\nSDSD&Std of successive RR interval differences\\\\\n\\hline\nRMSSD&Root mean square of successive differences\\\\\n\\hline\nNN50&\\#successive intervals differing more than 50 ms\\\\\n\\hline\npNN50&relative amount of NN50\\\\\n\\hline\nHRVTI&Total number of RR intervals/height of the histogram\\\\\n\\hline\nTINN&Width of RR histogram through triangular interpolation\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{scriptsize}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{table}\n\\section{Experimental Evaluation}\nIn this section, we explain our data collection, available benchmark dataset, baseline methods and evaluation.\n\\subsection{Datasets and Baseline Methods}\nWe validate and compare \\emph{AutoCogniSys} with baseline methods on both publicly available and our collected datasets.\n\\subsubsection{RCC Dataset: Collection and Ground Truth Annotation}\nFor collecting Retirement Community Center Dataset (RCC Dataset), we recruited 22 participants (19 females and 3 males) with age range from 77-93 (mean 85.5, std 3.92) in a continuing care retirement community with the appropriate institutional IRB approval and signed consent. The gender diversity in the recruited participants reflects the gender distribution (85\\% female and 15\\% male) in the retirement community facility. A trained gerontology graduate student evaluator completes surveys with participants to fill out the surveys. Participants are given a wrist band to wear on their dominant hand, and concurrently another trained IT graduate student have the IoT system setup in participants' own living environment (setup time 15-30 minutes). The participants are instructed to perform 13 \\emph{complex ADLs}. Another project member remotely monitors the sensor readings, videos and system failure status. The entire session lasts from 2-4 hours of time depending on participants' physical and cognitive ability.\n\nWe follow the standard protocol to annotate demographics and activities mentioned in the IRB. Two graduate students are engaged to annotate activities (postural, gestural and complex activity) whereas the observed activity performances are computed by the evaluator. Two more graduate students are engaged to validate the annotations on the videos. In overall, we are able to annotate 13 complex activities (total 291 samples) labeling for each participant; 8 hand gestures (total 43561 samples) and 4 postural activities (total 43561 samples) labeling. Annotation of postural and complex activities outcomes no difficulties from recorded videos. However, annotation of hand-gestures is extremely difficult in our scenario. We used video based hand tracker that can track and sketch wrist movements from a video episode \\cite{hugo14}. This sketching can help us significantly to identify which particular hand gesture is being performed in the time segment.\n\\subsubsection{EES Datasets: EDA and PPG Sensor Datasets}\nWe used Eight-Emotion Sentics (EES) dataset to validate \\emph{AutoCogniSys} proposed physiological signal processing approaches \\cite{picard01}. The dataset consists of measurements of four physiological signals (PPG/Blood Volume Pulse, electromyogram, respiration and Skin Conductance/EDA) and eight affective states (neutral, anger, hate, grief, love, romantic love, joy, and reverence). The study was taken once a day in a session lasting around 25 minutes for 20 days of recordings from an individual participant. We consider only PPG and EDA for all of the affective states in our study.\n\\subsubsection{Baseline Methods}\nThough no frameworks ever combined all modalities together into real-time automated cognitive health assessment, we evaluate \\emph{AutoCogniSys} performance by comparing the performances of its components individually with upto date relevant works. For hand gesture and postural activity recognition, we consider \\cite{alam17} proposed method as baseline. For complex activity recognition, we compare our hand gesture and postural activity classifiers aided HDBN model with three-level Dynamic Bayesian Network \\cite{zhu12} framework. For activity performance estimation, activity performance based cognitive health assessment; and EDA and PPG based cognitive health assessment, we have considered \\cite{alam16} proposed method as baseline.\n\\subsection{Activity Recognition Evaluation}\nThe standard definition for \\emph{accuracy} in any classification problem is $\\frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}$ where $TP,TN,FP$ and $FN$ are defined as true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative. For complex activity recognition evaluation, we additionally consider \\emph{start/end duration error} as performance metric that can be explained as follows: consider that the true duration of ``cooking'' is 30 minutes (10:05 AM - 10:35 AM) and our algorithm predicts 29 minutes (10.10 - to 10.39 AM). Then, the start/end duration error is 9 minutes ($|$5 minutes delayed start$|$ + $|$4 minutes hastened end$|$), in an overall error of e.g., 30\\% (9/30=0.3). We measure cross-participant accuracy using leave-two-participants-out method for performance metrics, i.e., we take out two of the participants' data points from the entire dataset, train our proposed classification models, test the model accuracy on the two left-out participants relevant data points, and continue the process for entire dataset.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!htb]\n\\begin{minipage}{0.45\\textwidth}\n\\begin{center}\n   \\epsfig{file=hand_gesture_accuracy.pdf,height=1.6in, width=3in}\n\\caption{Feature Weighted Naive Bayes (FWNB) classification accuracy comparisons with baseline approaches (graphical signatures of all hand gestures are shown).}\n   \\label{fig:hand_gesture_accuracy}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\begin{minipage}{0.29\\textwidth}\n\\begin{center}\n\\vspace{-.12in}\n   \\epsfig{file=posture_accuracy_normal.pdf,height=1.6in, width=2.1in}\n\\caption{4-class postural level activity recognition performance and comparisons with baseline method}\n   \\label{fig:posture_accuracy_normal}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\begin{minipage}{0.25\\textwidth}\n \\begin{center}\n \\vspace{-.12in}\n   \\epsfig{file=posture_accuracy_extended.pdf,height=1.6in, width=2.1in}\n\\caption{6-class diverse postural activity recognition framework accuracy comparisons with the baseline approach.}\n   \\label{fig:posture_accuracy_extended}\n\\end{center}\n \\end{minipage}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nFig~\\ref{fig:hand_gesture_accuracy} displays Feature Weighted Naive Bayes (FWNB) based the 8-hand gestural activity recognition accuracies comparisons with the baseline methods which clearly depicts the outperformance of our method (5\\% improvement) with an overall accuracy of 92\\% (FP rate 6.7\\%) in RCC dataset. For postural activity recognition, dataset achieving 91\\% postural activity recognition accuracy (FP rate 9.5\\%) which outperforms the baseline approach significantly (8\\% improvement). Now, we expand the postural activities for RCC datasets into 3 diverse `walking' postures: `normal walking', `walking with walker', `walking with single stick' and the accuracy goes down to 88\\% (FP 7.9\\%). Fig.~\\ref{fig:posture_accuracy_normal} and Fig.~\\ref{fig:posture_accuracy_extended} illustrate 4-class postural and extended 6-class postural classifier accuracies respectively which clearly posit that \\emph{AutoCogniSys} outperforms in each case of postural activities as well as overall performances (8\\% and 7\\% improvement respectively).\n\nFor complex activity classification, we choose RCC dataset to train our HDBN model. Our leave-two-participants out method results an accuracy of 85\\% (FP Rate 3.6\\%, precision 84.2\\%, recall 84.5\\%, ROC Area 98.2\\%) with a start/end duration error of 9.7\\%. We run the entire evaluation for baseline complex activity recognition algorithm too achieving an overall accuracy of 78\\% (FP Rate 5.2\\%, precision 79.6\\%, recall 78.5\\%, ROC Area 82.7\\%) which is clearly lower performed method than our approach. Fig. \\ref{fig:complex_activity_roc} and Fig~\\ref{fig:complex_activity_accuracy} illustrate the ROC curve and each complex activity recognition accuracy comparisons with baseline method which depict the outperformance of our framework over baseline methods (7\\% improvement). Fig~\\ref{fig:complex_activity_accuracy} also shows that inclusion of postural activity improves the final complex activity recognition (4\\% improvement).\n \\begin{figure}  [!htb]\n  \\begin{minipage}{0.15\\textwidth}\n \\begin{center}\n   \\epsfig{file=complex_activity_roc.pdf,height=1.4in, width=1.1in}\n\\caption{ROC curve for complex activity recognition}\n   \\label{fig:complex_activity_roc}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\begin{minipage}{0.33\\textwidth}\n\\begin{center}\n\n   \\epsfig{file=complex_activity_accuracy.pdf,height=1.4in, width=2.3in}\n\\caption{Complex ADLs recognition accuracy improvement and comparison with baseline \\cite{zhu12} and HMM based method}\n   \\label{fig:complex_activity_accuracy}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\end{minipage}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Quantification of Performance Score}\nTo characterize both the qualitative and quantitative health assessment performance scores, we start with four different feature groups ranging from both functional and physiological health measures: (i) observation based activity features, (ii) automatic activity performance features, (iii) EDA features and (iv) PPG features.\n\nIn \\emph{observation based activity features}, we design a complex activity set comprised of multiple subtasks which are involved with task {\\it interruption, completion and sequencing}. Participants are instructed to perform the complex activities while the trained evaluator observed the aforementioned functional activity performance measures. Each incorrect attempt of performance measure will be assigned one point thus higher score reflects lower performance of functional activities \\cite{dawadi14}. We first detect hand gesture and postural activities. Then, we feed the low-level activity contexts (gestural and postural) combined with ambient contexts (object and ambient motion sensor readings) into HDBN for single inhabitant model \\cite{alam16b} to recognize complex activities. The complex activity recognition framework provides both activity labels and activity window (start-end points). Then, we extract features of object sensor, ambient sensor, gestural activity and postural activity events for each activity window. The features are number of occurrences, mean number of occurrences, consecutive 1, 2, 3, $\\ldots$ 20 occurrences, top 10, 20, 30, $\\ldots$, 90 percentile etc (29 features in total). In \\emph{physiological features} we first detect 13 complex activities using HDBN algorithm which provides activity labels and activity window (start-end points), apply noise reduction, motion artifacts removal, extract 7 EDA features and 8 HRV features for each activity and take the mean of them over time (minutes) to get 15 (7+8) complex activity physiological features set for each participant. In summary, we extract 3 observation based activity features, 29 automatic activity performance features, 7 EDA features and 8 HRV features.\n\\subsection{Physiological Signal Processing Performance Evaluation}\nStandard evaluation technique should use both experimental and publicly available datasets to confirm the outperformance of the novel approaches. We first evaluate our physiological signal processing techniques using a publicly available dataset (EES Dataset \\cite{picard01}) to detect 8 human emotions. Then, in next section, we evaluate our methods in assessing cognitive health status of older adults using RCC dataset.\n\nFor EDA, we first apply SWT method to remove motion artifacts and noises. Then, we use cvxEDA method to separate tonic and phasic components of EDA. Then, we extract 7 EDA features on a sliding window of 4 seconds. Finally, we feed the 7 EDA features into a SMO based SVM algorithm \\cite{cao06}. We use 10-fold cross validation to classify eight emotions achieving 87\\% of overall accuracy (FP rate 6\\%). For PPG, we first apply our proposed PMAF based noises and motion artifacts removal technique. Then, we calculate HRV and perform time-domain feature extraction to extract 8 HRV features on a sliding window of 4 seconds. We feed these features into a SMO based SVM algorithm \\cite{cao06}. Our 10-fold cross validation shows accuracy of 79\\% (FP rate 11.5\\%) of detecting 8 emotions on EES Dataset. Fig. \\ref{fig:ees_eda} and Fig. \\ref{fig:ees_ppg} clearly depict that \\emph{AutoCogniSys} proposed EDA and PPG signal processing techniques significantly improve the accuracy over the baseline \\cite{alam16} method (10\\% and 12\\% improvement).\n\n\\begin{figure}[!htb]\n\\begin{minipage}{0.24\\textwidth}\n\\begin{center}\n   \\epsfig{file=ees_eda.pdf,height=1.2in, width=1.8in}\n\\caption{(EES Databaset) EDA features based Eight Emotion classification accuracy comparisons with baseline method}\n   \\label{fig:ees_eda}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\begin{minipage}{0.23\\textwidth}\n\\begin{center}\n   \\epsfig{file=ees_ppg.pdf,height=1.2in, width=1.7in}\n\\caption{(EES Dataset) PPG features based 8-Emotion classification accuracy comparisons with baseline method}\n   \\label{fig:ees_ppg}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{minipage}\n\n\\end{figure}\n\\subsection{Evaluation of Performance Scores}\nThe feature subsets used in the experimentation for observation and survey based clinical assessments and technology guided physiological and activity initiated health assessments are depicted in Table~\\ref{tab:feature_subset}. From our 6 demographics surveys, we find significant distributions in terms of cognition only for SLUMS Score (S-Score). Based on that, we divide our participants pool into three groups: \\emph{Not Cognitively Impaired (NCI), Mild Cognitively Impaired (MCI) and Cognitively Impaired (CI)} where the number of participants are $5$, $7$ and $10$ respectively.\n\\begin{table}[!t]\n\\begin{scriptsize}\n\n\n{\\centering \n\\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{.6}\n\\caption{Feature Subsets}\n\\label{tab:feature_subset}\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|L{5.5cm}|}\n\\hline\n\\bfseries Feature& \\bfseries Description\\\\\n\\hline\nObservation & Task Completeness (TC), Sequencing (SEQ), Interruptions (INT)\\\\\n\\hline\nSurvey & SLUMS Score (S-Score), ZUNG Score (Z-Score), IADL Score (I-Score), Yale Score (YPAS), Barthel Score (B-Score), GDS Score (G-Score)\\\\\n\\hline\nEDA  and HRV & 7 and 8 Features\\\\\n\\hline\nActivity Performance& Supervised (TC, SEQ, INT), Unsupervised\\\\\n\\hline\nArousal& EDA and HRV features of each complex activity window\\\\\n\\hline\n\n\\end{tabular}\n}\n\\end{scriptsize}\n\\end{table}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[!htb]\n\\begin{center}\n   \\epsfig{file=group_correlation.pdf,height=1in, width=3.3in}\n\\caption{\\emph{AutoCogniSys} Proposed Method Based Group Correlation analysis ( $r-value$) NCI, MCI and CI represent not cognitive, mild cognitive and cognitively impaired group of population.

Fig. \\ref{fig:group_correlation} and Fig. \\ref{fig:group_correlation_baseline} show the group correlation analysis results based on \\emph{AutoCogniSys} proposed framework and baseline \\cite{alam16} framework respectively. It can be clearly depicted that our proposed framework improves the correlation with the ground truths.\n\\subsection{Machine Learning Classification of Cognitive Health}\nWe evaluate using machine learning classifiers to predict cognitive status of older adults using both individual modalities and combined features. We use leave-two-participants out method to train and test classification accuracy.\n\nWe first choose the individual activity features (machine learning method based interruption scores, sequencing scores, unsupervised scores) and their combined features to train and test cognitive impairment status classification for SMO based SVM algorithm \\cite{cao06}. The classification accuracies are 72\\%, 69\\%, 76\\% and 83\\% respectively. Then we consider 7 EDA-activity features and 8 HRV-activity features individually in training and testing phase of SMO based SVM algorithm \\cite{cao06} resulting 85\\% and 80\\% accuracy respectively.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!htb]\n\\begin{minipage}{0.24\\textwidth}\n\\begin{center}\n   \\epsfig{file=combined_classification.pdf,height=1.2in, width=1.7in}\n   \\vspace{-.15in}\n\\caption{Individual and combined classification accuracies comparison with baseline method for cognitive impairment status detection}\n   \\label{fig:combined_classification}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\begin{minipage}{0.23\\textwidth}\n\\begin{center}\n   \\epsfig{file=each_activity_cognitive_assessment.pdf,height=1.2in, width=1.7in}\n\n\\caption{Machine learning based cognitive health assessment accuracy for each complex activity in terms of activity, EDA and HRV features.}\n   \\label{fig:each_activity_cognitive_assessment}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFor combined classifier, we first applied sequential forward feature selection to find the best combinations of 1- 3 features for cognitive impairment classification group MCI, NCI and CI in terms of combined activity features (29 features), EDA-activity features (7 features) and HRV-activity features (8) features. Our final combined classifier (SMO based SVM algorithm \\cite{cao06}) provides an accuracy of {\\bf 93\\%} in detecting the cognitive impairment status of older adults. Fig. \\ref{fig:combined_classification} shows our proposed individual and combined methods outperform the baseline \\cite{alam16} significantly (13\\% improvement). Fig. \\ref{fig:each_activity_cognitive_assessment} shows the cognitive impairment status prediction accuracy for each modality (activity feature, EDA and HRV) per individual complex activity.\n\\subsection{Discussion}\nIf we exclude the postural activities from automated activity performance scoring, we find reduced statistical correlation with original task completeness performance for \\{NCI, MCI, CI\\} participant group (INT 0.53*, SEQ 0.21' and unsupervised 0.49'). However, if we skip our proposed motion artifact removal stage, we find reduced statistical correlation with \\{NCI, MCI\\} and \\{MCI, CI\\} groups of participants (EDA and HRV correlations respectively \\{0.51*, -0.51*\\} and \\{-0.53*,0.46\\}). To test our proposed motion artifacts removal impact on EDA signals more rigorously, we choose 5 random participants, engage one expert motion artifact annotator to annotate motion artifacts segment on each participant's first 30 minutes of complex dataset using recorded video and apply both baseline and our methods to detect motion artifact segments. While baseline method achieves 75.5\\% (FP rate 20.3\\%) accuracy in detecting motion artifact segments, \\emph{AutoCogniSys} outperforms achieving 89.9\\% (FP rate 8.9\\%) accuracy. In terms of experience, we have seen 100\\% acceptance of wearing wrist-band,  71\\% of acceptance for signing consent on using cameras and 0\\% failure rate of collecting continuous data.\n\\section{Conclusion}\nWe propose, \\emph{AutoCogniSys}, an IoT inspired design approach combining wearable and ambient sensors embedded smart home design, extensive signal processing, machine learning algorithms and statistical analytics to automate cognitive health assessment in terms of complex activity performances and physiological responses of daily events. Additionally, our postural activity detection approach in diverse population cum improved activity performance measurement and fundamental physiological sensor artifacts removal from physiological sensors help facilitate the automated cross-sectional cognitive health assessment of the older adults. Our efficient evaluation on each modality (physical, physiological and ambient) and each activity mode proves that any of the mode (say single activity and single sensor) also can provide significant improved cognitive health assessment measure.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, answer the following question based on the above text, only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nQuestion: What types of sensors are now capable of estimating physical activity levels and physiological outcomes of older adults?\nAnswer:", "summary_gt": "", "input_tokens": 7699, "output_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 7699, "source_file": "multifieldqa_en.jsonl"}

Wayfair, Inc. - Harvard Law Review\nFourth Circuit Invalidates Maryland Statute Regulating Price Gouging in the Sale of Generic Drugs.\nSouth Dakota Supreme Court Holds Unconstitutional State Law Requiring Internet Retailers Without In-State Physical Presence to Remit Sales Tax.\nJudicial junk, the Court has long thought, is easier to scrap when the erroneous precedent cannot be fixed by Congress, as in constitutional cases.1× 1. See Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 405–10 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting); Lee Epstein, William M. Landes & Adam Liptak, The Decision to Depart (or Not) from Constitutional Precedent: An Empirical Study of the Roberts Court, 90 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1115, 1116 (2015) (“[Justice Brandeis’s] dissenting opinion . . . now has the status of black letter law.”). On the flip side, whenever a bad precedent can be corrected by Congress, stare decisis applies with “special force.”2× 2. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 172–73 (1989). The Court, following Justice Brandeis, usually articulates the rule as distinguishing between “constitutional” and “statutory” precedents. See, e.g., id. But the distinction is occasionally said to be between “constitutional” and “nonconstitutional cases.” See, e.g., Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530, 543 (1962) (plurality opinion). Nomenclature aside, the Court has — until now — adhered to Justice Brandeis’s key insight that the important factor is whether or not the mistake may be legislatively corrected. Last Term, in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.,3× 3. 138 S. Ct. 2080 (2018). the Court tinkered with this thinking in overruling an outdated dormant commerce clause precedent. Dormant commerce clause decisions technically produce constitutional holdings, but Congress may override them at will.4× 4. See Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin, 328 U.S. 408, 421–27 (1946). Under the usual logic of stare decisis, it should take special force to dislodge such precedents. But Wayfair applied the weakened stare decisis of constitutional cases, asserting that the Court must “address a false constitutional premise . . . . whether or not Congress can or will act.”5× 5. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2096–97.\nEmerging from Wayfair is an odd and ominous development in stare decisis doctrine. Odd, because it turns on a formal classification instead of on Congress’s practical ability to fix the problem. Ominous, because the Court’s logic leads far past the dormant commerce clause. Wayfair grants only feeble stare decisis to precedents that set a “constitutional default rule,”6× 6. Id. at 2096 (“While . . . Congress has the authority to change the physical presence rule, Congress cannot change the constitutional default rule.”). meaning constitutional decisions that allow for legislative adjustment or override. This new stare decisis analysis makes other precedents setting constitutional default rules more vulnerable — including, perhaps, mainstays of criminal procedure like Miranda v. Arizona7× 7. 384 U.S. 436 (1966). and Mapp v. Ohio.8× 8. 367 U.S. 643 (1961).\nSince its 1967 decision in National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue,9× 9. 386 U.S. 753 (1967). the Court has held that, under the “dormant” or “negative” implication of the Commerce Clause,10× 10. The dormant or negative commerce clause is a judicial derivation from the Commerce Clause “prohibiting States from discriminating against or imposing excessive burdens on interstate commerce without congressional approval,” which “strikes at one of the chief evils that led to the adoption of the Constitution, namely, state tariffs and other laws that burdened interstate commerce.” Comptroller of the Treasury of Md. v. Wynne, 135 S. Ct. 1787, 1794 (2015). states may not compel remote sellers with no physical presence in the state to collect and remit sales taxes.11× 11. See Bellas Hess, 386 U.S. at 759–60. In Quill Corp. v. North Dakota,12× 12. 504 U.S. 298 (1992). the Court refused to overrule the “bright-line, physical-presence requirement” of Bellas Hess, leaning heavily on stare decisis.13× 13. Id. at 317–18. Three Justices joined a concurrence explaining that their decision rested solely “on the basis of stare decisis.” Id. at 320 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). So the physical presence test remained the law of the land while the internet conquered the earth. Justice Kennedy had joined the Quill majority and Justice Scalia’s concurring opinion emphasizing stare decisis, but by 2015 he had second thoughts. Writing separately in Direct Marketing Ass’n v. Brohl,14× 14. 135 S. Ct. 1124 (2015). Justice Kennedy acknowledged that “[t]he Internet has caused far-reaching systemic and structural changes in the economy” and therefore “Quill now harms States to a degree far greater than could have been anticipated earlier.”15× 15. Id. at 1135 (Kennedy, J., concurring). He concluded with the wish that “[t]he legal system should find an appropriate case for this Court to reexamine Quill and Bellas Hess.”16× 16. Id.\nSeldom has a concurring opinion signed by a lone Justice prompted a state to officially declare an emergency. Yet in 2016, in response to Justice Kennedy’s overture, the South Dakota legislature passed a law, S.B. 106, “to provide for the collection of sales taxes from certain remote sellers . . . and to declare an emergency.”17× 17. 2016 S.D. Sess. Laws ch. 70 pmbl. 217 (codified at S.D. Codified Laws § 10-64 (2017)). It required every remote seller to collect and remit sales tax if the seller’s business in South Dakota comprised either a “gross revenue” greater than $100,000 or at least 200 “separate transactions” within one calendar year.18× 18. Id. § 1. Significantly, the law did not apply retroactively.19× 19. Id. § 5. The “emergency” declaration was necessary to give the law immediate effect, for the purpose of “permitting the most expeditious possible review of the constitutionality of this law” by the U.S. Supreme Court.20× 20. Id. § 8(8). As Justice Alito put it, the “South Dakota law [was] obviously a test case.”21× 21. Transcript of Oral Argument at 27, Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. 2080 (No. 17-494), https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2017/17-494_7lho.pdf [https://perma.cc/8HYH-VU8N].\nExpeditiously, a group of remote sellers challenged the law. After being sued by South Dakota for refusing to register for the newly required sales tax license, Wayfair, Inc., Overstock.com, Inc., and Newegg, Inc. moved for summary judgment in South Dakota circuit court on the grounds that S.B. 106 was unconstitutional under Quill and Bellas Hess — a point South Dakota conceded, indicating that it was seeking review by the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Quill.22× 22. State v. Wayfair Inc., 2017 SD 56, ¶¶ 9–11, 901 N.W.2d 754, 759–60. Accordingly, the South Dakota circuit court granted the motion for summary judgment and South Dakota appealed to the state’s highest court.23× 23. Id. ¶ 12, 901 N.W.2d at 760. The South Dakota Supreme Court unanimously affirmed, recognizing that South Dakota’s “arguments on the merits” may be “persuasive” but “Quill remains the controlling precedent.”24× 24. Id. ¶ 18, 901 N.W.2d at 761. See generally Recent Case, State v. Wayfair Inc., 2017 SD 56, 901 N.W.2d 754 (S.D. 2017), 131 Harv. L. Rev. 2089 (2018).\nThe U.S. Supreme Court vacated and remanded.25× 25. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2100. Writing for the Court one last time, Justice Kennedy26× 26. Justices Thomas, Ginsburg, Alito, and Gorsuch joined Justice Kennedy’s opinion. pilloried Quill’s physical presence rule as “arbitrary, formalistic,” “anachronistic,” and “unfair and unjust” to both states and brick-and-mortar retailers.27× 27. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2092, 2095. After all, the rationale of Quill was that remote sellers lacked a sufficiently “substantial nexus” with the state to justify imposing a duty of tax collection.28× 28. Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298, 311 (1992) (quoting Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U.S. 274, 279 (1977)). This was wrong even in the mail-order catalog days of 1967 and 1992, but “the Internet revolution has made [Quill’s] earlier error all the more egregious and harmful.”29× 29. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2097; see also id. at 2092. The rule deprived the states of billions of dollars, since they could not force remote sellers to collect the tax and consumers hardly ever paid it on their own.30× 30. Id. at 2088 (“[C]onsumer compliance rates are notoriously low.”). Quill “serve[d] as a judicially created tax shelter” for remote retailers who do a great deal of business online.31× 31. Id. at 2094.\nSatisfied that Bellas Hess and Quill were wrongly decided, the Court then jumped the hurdle of stare decisis. The Quill Court had feared upsetting reliance interests.32× 32. Quill, 504 U.S. at 317 (“Bellas Hess . . . has engendered substantial reliance and has become part of the basic framework of a sizable industry.”). Wayfair shrugged off this concern, noting that “stare decisis accommodates only ‘legitimate reliance interest[s]’”; by contrast, reliance on the physical presence rule was largely due to consumers evading their use-tax obligations.33× 33. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2098 (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798, 824 (1982)). Quill had also appealed to Congress’s ultimate authority over interstate commerce as a reason to abide by a precedent, even if wrongly decided.34× 34. See Quill, 504 U.S. at 318–19; id. at 320 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (“Congress . . . can change the rule of Bellas Hess by simply saying so.”). But Wayfair denied that Congress’s ability to change the law was a proper consideration:\nWhile it can be conceded that Congress has the authority to change the physical presence rule, Congress cannot change the constitutional default rule. It is inconsistent with the Court’s proper role to ask Congress to address a false constitutional premise of this Court’s own creation. Courts have acted as the front line of review in this limited sphere; and hence it is important that their principles be accurate and logical, whether or not Congress can or will act in response.35× 35. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2096–97.\nHaving dispensed with the physical presence rule, the Court remanded the case to the South Dakota courts to determine in the first instance “whether some other principle in the Court’s Commerce Clause doctrine might invalidate the Act.”36× 36. Id. at 2099. But the Court listed “several features [of South Dakota law] that appear[ed] designed to prevent discrimination against or undue burdens upon interstate commerce.” Id.\nJustices Thomas and Gorsuch each filed concurring opinions. Justice Thomas wistfully likened himself to Justice White — who voted for Bellas Hess but against Quill a quarter-century later — and confessed that he “should have joined [Justice White’s dissenting] opinion.”37× 37. Id. at 2100 (Thomas, J., concurring). Justice Thomas added that the “Court’s entire negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence” is wrong and should be abandoned.38× 38. Id. Justice Gorsuch also wrote separately to express skepticism of the Court’s dormant commerce clause jurisprudence, raising “questions for another day” of whether the doctrine “can be squared with the text of the Commerce Clause, justified by stare decisis, or defended as misbranded products of federalism or antidiscrimination imperatives flowing from Article IV’s Privileges and Immunities Clause.”39× 39. Id. at 2100–01 (Gorsuch, J., concurring).\nChief Justice Roberts dissented.40× 40. Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan joined the Chief Justice’s dissent. Surprisingly, the dissenting Justices “agree[d] that Bellas Hess was wrongly decided, for many of the reasons given by the Court.”41× 41. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2101 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). The dispute between the majority and the dissent turned entirely on the principles and application of stare decisis. Chief Justice Roberts argued that whether or how to reverse Quill should be left to Congress, which “has the flexibility to address these questions in a wide variety of ways” and “can focus directly on current policy concerns rather than past legal mistakes.”42× 42. Id. at 2104. He also pointed to the “baffling” burdens of compliance with the idiosyncratic tax codes of “[o]ver 10,000 jurisdictions,” particularly for small businesses, and doubted that new “software” — the majority’s proposed solution to this mess43× 43. Id. at 2098 (majority opinion) (“Eventually, software that is available at a reasonable cost may make it easier for small businesses to cope with these problems.”). — would soon solve the problem.44× 44. Id. at 2103–04 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). In Bellas Hess, the Court reasoned that the dormant commerce clause protects interstate business from being “entangle[d] . . . in a virtual welter of complicated obligations to local jurisdictions.” Nat’l Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Dep’t of Revenue, 386 U.S. 753, 759–60 (1967). The dissent replied that the Court “vastly underestimate[d] the skill of contemporary man and his machines.” Id. at 766 (Fortas, J., dissenting). The dispute in Wayfair over whether software is up to the task effectively reprised the old debate from Bellas Hess, only this time couched as part of the stare decisis inquiry’s concern for reliance interests rather than as a matter of dormant commerce clause doctrine. While Wayfair acknowledged that “[c]omplex state tax systems could have the effect of discriminating against interstate commerce,” 138 S. Ct. at 2099, the Court remarked that “[t]he physical presence rule is a poor proxy” for an inquiry into any actual burdens imposed on interstate commerce, id. at 2093.\nChief Justice Roberts emphasized that a “heightened form of stare decisis”45× 45. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2102 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). applies when “Congress . . . can, if it wishes, override this Court’s decisions with contrary legislation.”46× 46. Id. at 2101 (first citing Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Cmty., 134 S. Ct. 2024, 2036 (2014) (tribal sovereign immunity); then citing Kimble v. Marvel Entm’t, LLC, 135 S. Ct. 2401, 2409 (2015) (statutory interpretation); and then citing Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2398, 2411 (2014) (judicially created doctrine implementing a judicially created cause of action)). In Quill, the Chief Justice noted, the Court had taken to heart that “Congress may be better qualified” and “has the ultimate power to resolve” the question47× 47. Id. at 2102 (quoting Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 279, 318 (1992)). while Justice Scalia had “recogniz[ed] that stare decisis has ‘special force’ in the dormant Commerce Clause context due to Congress’s ‘final say over regulation of interstate commerce.’”48× 48. Id. (quoting Quill, 504 U.S. at 320 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment)). Moreover, “[i]f stare decisis applied with special force in Quill, it should be an even greater impediment” afterward since Quill effectively “tossed [the ball] into Congress’s court.”49× 49. Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Kimble, 135 S. Ct. at 2409); cf. Bay Mills, 134 S. Ct. at 2039 n.12 (“When we inform Congress that it has primary responsibility over a sphere of law, and invite Congress to consider a specific issue within that sphere, we cannot deem irrelevant how Congress responds.”). Because the Court invited Congress to act and then “suddenly chang[ed] the ground rules, the Court may have waylaid Congress’s consideration of the issue.”50× 50. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2102–03 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).\nIn Wayfair, the Court applied the flimsier form of stare decisis to a precedent that could have been overruled by Congress. It did so in the context of a dormant commerce clause case, but Wayfair’s logic extends to all constitutional default rules — that is, constitutional decisions that Congress remains free to change. Not only does Wayfair deviate from the Court’s decades-old stare decisis analysis, it also imperils other precedents that set constitutional default rules.\nThe Court’s reasoning in Wayfair departs from its prior stare decisis analysis. In 1932, Justice Brandeis posited that stare decisis must bend “in cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible.”51× 51. Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 406–07 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). The Court has long since adopted his argument,52× 52. See, e.g., Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649, 665 (1944). as well as its corollary — that stare decisis commands “special force in the area of statutory interpretation” where “Congress remains free to alter what [the Court has] done.”53× 53. Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 172–73 (1989). For normative evaluations of heightened stare decisis for statutory precedents, see generally Einer Elhauge, Statutory Default Rules: How to Interpret Unclear Legislation 211–23 (2008); and William N. Eskridge, Jr., Overruling Statutory Precedents, 76 Geo. L.J. 1361, 1364–1409 (1988). Justice Brandeis’s logic demands that dormant commerce clause cases, where Congress is free to act, be granted the weightier stare decisis.54× 54. Scholars have noted the curious fact that Justice Brandeis included many dormant commerce clause cases as examples of overruled constitutional precedents. See, e.g., Earl M. Maltz, Commentary, Some Thoughts on the Death of Stare Decisis in Constitutional Law, 1980 Wis. L. Rev. 467, 468–469, 469 n.11. One explanation for this is that Justice Brandeis sought the authority of Chief Justice Taney’s dictum that the Court’s “opinion upon the construction of the Constitution is always open to discussion” — which referred to the dormant commerce clause. See Burnet, 285 U.S. at 408 n.3 (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (quoting The Passenger Cases, 48 U.S. (7 How.) 283, 470 (1849) (Taney, C.J., dissenting)). In Chief Justice Taney’s time, it was thought that Congress could not override the Court’s dormant commerce clause decisions, see Cooley v. Bd. of Wardens, 53 U.S. (12 How.) 299, 321 (1852), so the context of Chief Justice Taney’s dictum does not conflict with Justice Brandeis’s theory of stare decisis. The Court applied this reasoning in Quill, as Chief Justice Roberts underscored.55× 55. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2102 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).\nYet the Wayfair majority refused to consider Congress’s authority to legislate as a relevant factor for stare decisis.56× 56. Even Justice Kennedy’s earlier opinion in Direct Marketing contemplated judicially overruling Quill, conspicuously neglecting a possible legislative solution. See supra p. 278. The Court even insisted that to do so “is inconsistent with the Court’s proper role,” since Quill embodied “a false constitutional premise of th[e] Court’s own creation.”57× 57. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2096 (emphasis added). This refusal breaks from the practical Brandeisian wisdom that has guided the Court’s treatment of precedent for the better part of a century. The point is not that stare decisis should have ultimately propped up Bellas Hess yet again, as Wayfair’s dissenting Justices maintained. After all, a realistic approach that is alert to each branch’s institutional capacities might have led to the conclusion that Congress was actually ill-equipped to overrule Quill. In this vein, the Court could have sensibly pointed out that Congress is unlikely to stick its neck out with a tax hike (or a look-alike) from which only the states would benefit.58× 58. For two practical arguments to this effect, see Brian Galle, Essay, Kill Quill, Keep the Dormant Commerce Clause: History’s Lessons on Congressional Control of State Taxation, 70 Stan. L. Rev. Online 158, 160–62 (2018), https://review.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/03/70-Stan.-L.-Rev.-Online-158-Galle.pdf [https://perma.cc/22YP-P4V5]; Edward A. Zelinsky, The Political Process Argument for Overruling Quill, 82 Brook. L. Rev. 1177, 1191–92 (2017). Indeed, South Dakota advanced such practical arguments in its brief.59× 59. See Petitioner’s Brief at 54, Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. 2080 (No. 17-494) (“Congress has little incentive to act here because it would be (or appear to be) authorizing new or greater tax collections from its constituents, while receiving none of the revenue in return.”). More generally, the Court might have discussed the limits of the states’ influence in the federal system as a reason not to wait for congressional intervention, a topic it has debated on other occasions.60× 60. See Richard H. Pildes, Institutional Formalism and Realism in Constitutional and Public Law, 2013 Sup. Ct. Rev. 1, 30–32; see also Galle, supra note 58, at 159 (“Congress is not a trustworthy guardian of state fiscal power, making continuing judicial involvement a more appealing prospect.”). Or it could have argued that new facts on the ground — namely, the blast of e-commerce that hit like a comet after Quill — overpowered stare decisis of any force, special or plain.61× 61. Two recent studies of stare decisis highlighted the physical presence rule as exemplifying a precedent that may reasonably be overruled due to changed facts. See Bryan A. Garner et al., The Law of Judicial Precedent 364–65 (2016); Randy J. Kozel, Settled Versus Right: A Theory of Precedent 112–13 (2017). It should be noted that the authors of The Law of Judicial Precedent classify the physical presence rule as a constitutional precedent for stare decisis purposes, thus anticipating the Court’s misstep in Wayfair. Garner et al., supra, at 354–65. Because even statutory precedents may sometimes be overruled,62× 62. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 173–74 (1989) (discussing justifications for overruling statutory precedents). Contra Lawrence C. Marshall, “Let Congress Do It”: The Case for an Absolute Rule of Statutory Stare Decisis, 88 Mich. L. Rev. 177 (1989). the Court could have killed Quill without first planting its constitutional kiss of death.63× 63. Cf. Thomas R. Lee, Stare Decisis in Historical Perspective: From the Founding Era to the Rehnquist Court, 52 Vand. L. Rev. 647, 704 (1999) (“Justice Brandeis’ . . . memorable prose has since become a mandatory part of the burial rite for any constitutional precedent.”).\nThe Court resisted such arguments. Instead, Wayfair reasoned that Congress’s total ability to correct an erroneous decision counts for nothing when the Court gets the Constitution wrong. That such a theory sprouts from a case like Wayfair, which repudiated a “formalistic distinction,”64× 64. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2092. is ironic. Wayfair’s stare decisis analysis resorts to the formalism of making constitutional a “magic” word65× 65. See Transcript of Oral Argument, supra note 21, at 12. rather than asking whether Congress can step in.\nMoreover, the Court’s new thinking on stare decisis threatens other constitutional default rules. Wayfair now stands for the proposition that a “constitutional default rule” — a term the Court apparently lifted from South Dakota’s reply brief on the merits66× 66. Reply Brief at 22, Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. 2080 (No. 17-494) (“Congress is polarized, which makes it critical . . . to get the constitutional default rule right.”). — gets only weakened stare decisis. To appreciate why this holding matters, it is worth exploring the concept and scope of constitutional default rules. Contract theory describes default rules as legal rules that the parties may “contract around.”67× 67. See, e.g., Ian Ayres & Robert Gertner, Filling Gaps in Incomplete Contracts: An Economic Theory of Default Rules, 99 Yale L.J. 87, 87 (1989). Although “constitutional default rule” could be read broadly to include a variety of actors and contracting mechanisms,68× 68. See John Ferejohn & Barry Friedman, Toward a Political Theory of Constitutional Default Rules, 33 Fla. St. U. L. Rev. 825, 826 (2006) (“When we speak of default rules in constitutional law, we typically are talking about specifications of ways the government can act (or modify its behavior) to get around a constitutional prohibition.”). the Court’s use of the term for purposes of stare decisis may be narrowly defined as judicial precedents of constitutional law that “are ultimately subject to congressional control.”69× 69. Gillian E. Metzger, Congress, Article IV, and Interstate Relations, 120 Harv. L. Rev. 1468, 1525 (2007) (describing judicially enforceable “constitutional default rules imposing obligations on the states in the name of union [that] are ultimately subject to congressional control”). The dormant commerce clause is a paradigmatic constitutional default rule because what the Court does today Congress may undo tomorrow. Justice Scalia declared this fact “[t]he clearest sign that the negative Commerce Clause is a judicial fraud,” for “[h]ow could congressional consent lift a constitutional prohibition?”70× 70. Comptroller of the Treasury of Md. v. Wynne, 135 S. Ct. 1787, 1808 (2015) (Scalia, J., dissenting). But that’s what a constitutional default rule is. The Court has allowed Congress to overturn its dormant commerce clause cases since 1891.71× 71. See In re Rahrer, 140 U.S. 545, 560–62 (1891).\nDormant commerce clause cases are not the only constitutional default rules. Professor Laurence Tribe’s treatise identifies two others.72× 72. 1 Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law § 6-35 (3d ed. 2000). And in a groundbreaking article, Professor Henry Monaghan revealed “a substructure of substantive, procedural, and remedial rules” forming “a constitutional common law subject to amendment, modification, or even reversal by Congress.”73× 73. Henry P. Monaghan, The Supreme Court, 1974 Term — Foreword: Constitutional Common Law, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 2–3 (1975); see also Susan R. Klein, Identifying and (Re)Formulating Prophylactic Rules, Safe Harbors, and Incidental Rights in Constitutional Criminal Procedure, 99 Mich. L. Rev. 1030 (2001) (further developing Monaghan’s theory in criminal procedure context). What follows is a list of six lines of cases beyond the dormant commerce clause that may be fairly described as constitutional default rules. The first two are drawn from Tribe’s treatise while the next four are found in Monaghan’s article:\n(1) State Taxation of Federal Instrumentalities: States may not tax instrumentalities of the federal government74× 74. McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 436 (1819). — unless Congress consents.75× 75. See, e.g., Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U.S. 405, 411 n.1 (1938) (“Congress may curtail an immunity which might otherwise be implied or enlarge it beyond the point where, Congress being silent, the Court would set its limits.” (citations omitted)). One court has described such judicial decisions as setting a “constitutional default rule.” United States v. Delaware, 958 F.2d 555, 560 n.9 (3d Cir. 1992) (“[W]e must decide the constitutional default rule for this type of tax, fully aware that Congress could decide at any time to reverse our decision statutorily.”). (2) Article I, Section 10 Cases: Article I, Section 10 provides that certain prohibitions on the states may be waived by Congress.76× 76. See U.S. Const. art. I, § 10, cls. 2–3. The Court has taken note of this when considering whether to overrule, for instance, an Import-Export Clause precedent.77× 77. See Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, 324 U.S. 652, 668 (1945) (“In view of the fact that the Constitution gives Congress authority to consent to state taxation of imports and hence to lay down its own test for determining when the immunity ends, we see no convincing practical reason for abandoning the test which has been applied for more than a century . . . .”), overruled on other grounds by Limbach v. Hooven & Allison Co., 466 U.S. 353 (1984). In Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U.S. 276 (1976), the Court left open the question whether “Congress may authorize, under the Import-Export Clause, an exaction that it could not directly impose under the Tax Clause.” Id. at 301 n.13. Metzger, however, argues that the Import-Export Clause is free of other clauses’ limits on congressional power. See Metzger, supra note 69, at 1500 & n.120. (3) Bivens Cases: In Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics,78× 78. 403 U.S. 388 (1971). the Court held that a violation of the Fourth Amendment gives rise to a right to sue for damages.79× 79. Id. at 397. But the Court has also held that “[s]uch a cause of action may be defeated . . . when . . . Congress has provided an alternative remedy which it explicitly declared to be a substitute for recovery directly under the Constitution and viewed as equally effective.”80× 80. Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 18–19 (1980). (4) Miranda Cases: The Miranda Court famously “encourage[d]” Congress and the states to explore alternative “procedures which are at least as effective in apprising accused persons of their right of silence and in assuring a continuous opportunity to exercise it.”81× 81. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 467 (1966). In Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428 (2000), the Court struck down a congressional attempt to effectively abolish Miranda, holding that “Miranda announced a constitutional rule that Congress may not supersede legislatively.” Id. at 444. But Dickerson also stood by Miranda’s “invitation for legislative action” to replace Miranda with an adequate substitute. Id. at 440; see also Michael C.

Wade,82× 82. 388 U.S. 218 (1967). the Court created an exclusionary rule for evidence obtained from a police lineup in violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel but acknowledged that it could be replaced by “[l]egislative or other regulations . . . which eliminate the risks of abuse.”83× 83. Id. at 239. (6) The Exclusionary Rule Cases: Mapp v. Ohio made the Fourth Amendment “exclusionary rule” binding on the states,84× 84. 367 U.S. 643, 655 (1961). yet Congress is thought to have the power to replace it.85× 85. See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 422–24 (1971) (Burger, C.J., dissenting) (inviting Congress to replace the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule); Harold J. Krent, How to Move Beyond the Exclusionary Rule: Structuring Judicial Response to Legislative Reform Efforts, 26 Pepp. L. Rev. 855, 864–71 (1999).\nAll of the above are arguably constitutional default rules set by the Court that remain, to one degree or another, open to congressional revision. The list could be longer or shorter, depending on which default rules the Court will view as constitutional86× 86. A shorter list could be produced by whittling away at the constitutional status of the cases identified by Monaghan. While the Court has held that Miranda is a constitutional decision, Dickerson, 530 U.S. at 444, some of the other cases may be viewed as nonconstitutional. See, e.g., Collins v. Virginia, 138 S. Ct. 1663, 1675–80 (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring) (arguing that Mapp is “nonconstitutional,” id. at 1678 n.5); Richard H. Fallon, Jr. et al., Hart and Wechsler’s The Federal Courts and the Federal System 775–77 (7th ed. 2015) (discussing whether Bivens is constitutionally required). Conversely, a longer list might include any constitutional right that can be waived by a party. See, e.g., Daniel A. Farber, Another View of the Quagmire: Unconstitutional Conditions and Contract Theory, 33 Fla. St. U. L. Rev. 913, 918 (2006) (describing the Eleventh Amendment as “just a contractual default rule that the states are free to barter away”). Such a list might also include various constitutionally inspired judicial presumptions. See, e.g., Jack Goldsmith & John F. Manning, The President’s Completion Power, 115 Yale L.J. 2280, 2299 (2006) (describing the Chevron presumption of delegated interpretive power to administrative agencies as “a constitutionally inspired default rule”); Nicholas Quinn Rosenkranz, Federal Rules of Statutory Interpretation, 115 Harv. L. Rev. 2085, 2097–98 (2002) (describing clear statement rules as “constitutional default rules” reversible by Congress). Many other decisions could likely be characterized as constitutional default rules; the list above is only an initial stab. and on how it will answer open questions about congressional authority over certain constitutional provisions.87× 87. See, e.g., Thomas v. Wash. Gas Light Co., 448 U.S. 261, 272 n.18 (1980) (plurality opinion) (leaving unresolved whether Congress may limit constitutional full faith and credit obligations); White v. Mass. Council of Constr. Emp’rs, Inc., 460 U.S. 204, 215 n.1 (1983) (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (leaving unresolved “whether Congress may authorize . . . what otherwise would be a violation” of the Privileges and Immunities Clause); 1 Tribe, supra note 72, § 6-35, at 1243–44 (arguing that Congress cannot override judicial constructions of the Privileges and Immunities Clause); Metzger, supra note 69, at 1486–89 (arguing the opposite). But the takeaway is clear: weaker stare decisis for constitutional default rules. Pre-Wayfair, one would have thought that stare decisis applies with special force to such precedents, given congressional power to set them straight. Not anymore. Why? Because it is improper to “ask Congress to address a false constitutional premise of th[e] Court’s own creation.”88× 88. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. at 2096. The Latin for Wayfair’s doctrine is not stare decisis, which should reflect a realistic, working relationship between the legislative and judicial branches. It is mea culpa.\nIn its zeal to update the Constitution for “the Cyber Age,”89× 89. Id. at 2097. the Court deleted Congress from stare decisis doctrine in constitutional cases. The Court had better options. It could have left Quill on Congress’s doorstep, as the dissent argued. Or it could have justified overruling Quill notwithstanding the special force of stare decisis. Instead, the Court reasoned that it doesn’t matter whether Congress is willing and able to do the job: a constitutional mess calls for a judicial clean-up crew. For constitutional default rules — a category of decisions embracing the dormant commerce clause and sweeping far beyond — Wayfair’s new theory of stare decisis makes the Court’s precedents less sticky and Congress less relevant.\n\nNow, answer the following question based on the above text, only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nQuestion: What did Justice Kennedy argue about Quill in Direct Marketing Ass'n v.

{"article": "You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nThe U.S. corporate income tax is based on worldwide economic activity. If all of a corporation's economic activity is in the United States, then tax administration and compliance is relatively straightforward. Many corporations, however, operate in several jurisdictions, which creates complications for tax administration and compliance. Further, corporations may actively choose where and how to organize to reduce their U.S. and worldwide tax liabilities. Some of these strategies have been referred to as expatriation, inversions, and mergers. This report begins with a brief discussion of relevant portions of the U.S. corporate income tax system before examining how inversions were commonly structured. The report then looks at how Congress and the Department of the Treasury have reduced the benefits of inversions. The report concludes with an examination of remaining methods for inverting and policy options available to prevent or limit these inversions. Achieving tax savings using an inversion became more difficult with the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (JOBS Act; P.L. 108-357 ). The JOBS Act denied or restricted the tax benefits of an inversion if the owners of the new company were not substantially different from the owners of the original company. The act also allowed a firm to invert only if it had substantial business operations in the country where the new headquarters was to be located. Although the 2004 legislation largely prevented the types of inversions that drew attention prior to its adoption, several companies have successfully inverted in the past few years by using the substantive business operations mechanism or merging. Treasury regulations have subsequently limited the former mechanism. In spring 2014, several high-profile companies indicated an interest in merging or plans to merge with a non-U.S. firm, including Pfizer, Chiquita, and Omnicom (an advertising firm). News reports indicated that a group of Walgreens investors was also urging such a move. Although the Pfizer and Omnicon mergers and Walgreens headquarters shifts ultimately did not take place, other firms announced mergers in the late spring and early summer. A number of firms in the medical device or pharmaceuticals fields announced mergers or proposed mergers with a shift of headquarters: Medtronics, Salix, AbbVie, Mylan, and Hospira. In August 2014, concern about inversions increased with the announcement that Burger King was in talks to merge with Tim Hortons, a Canadian firm, with the merged firm's headquarters in Canada. An agreement was announced on August 26. Although Burger King is a smaller firm than AbbVie, for example, it is a household name and this proposed inversion garnered much attention. In September 2014, the Treasury Department released a notice of regulatory changes that would restrict some aspects of inversions or their benefits and indicated that other actions may follow. AbbVie, Chiquita, and some other firms canceled their plans in the wake of these Treasury regulations, although new merger proposals were also announced. In November 2015, the Treasury announced additional regulatory restrictions. Although new inversions slowed significantly, others continued but in many cases have been structured to avoid the regulations by reducing ownership below 60%. Most notable of these is the proposed merger of Pfizer with Allergan in November 2015. Pfizer terminated the merger after the release of the April 4, 2016, regulations. This \"second wave\" of inversions again raised concerns about an erosion of the U.S. tax base. While the substantial business avenue appears to have been largely eliminated by Treasury regulations that increased the required share of activity, the option of merging with a smaller foreign company remains. U.S. firms may also merge with larger firms, although in this case the tax benefits are less likely to be key factors in the decision to merge. Data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis indicated that acquisitions by foreigners, which rose substantially in 2015, fell by 15% in 2016, and by 32% in 2017. Some of the largest declines were in countries associated with inversions, such as Ireland, where acquisitions fell from $176 billion in 2015, to $35 billion in 2016, and to $7 billion in 2017. In December 2017, a tax revision ( P.L. 115-97 ), often called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), and subsequently referred to as the \"Act,\" made major changes to the corporate tax and the international tax rules, along with some specific revisions aimed at discouraging inversions. Although data for 2018 are not yet available, one planned inversion, by Assurant, Inc., was revised to retain the headquarters in the United States. Ohio-based Dana, Inc. announced plans to merge and move the headquarters to the U.K., although the merger would leave the U.S. shareholders with less than 60% ownership, and therefore not make them subject to anti-inversion penalties. The United States uses a system that taxes both the worldwide income of U.S. corporations and the income of foreign firms earned within U.S. borders. All income earned within U.S. borders is taxed the same—in the year earned and at statutory tax rates of 21% (reduced from 35% by the Act). Under pre-Act law, U.S. corporate income earned outside the United States was also subject to U.S. taxation, though not necessarily in the year earned. This treatment occurred because U.S. corporations could defer U.S. tax on active income earned abroad in foreign subsidiaries until it was paid, or repatriated, to the U.S. parent company as a dividend. To mitigate double taxation, tax due on repatriated income was reduced by the amount of foreign taxes already paid. The Act substituted a new system (Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, or GILTI) that taxed foreign source income of U.S. subsidiaries currently but with an exemption for a deemed return of 10% on tangible assets and a deduction from the remaining income (for 50% of income through 2025 and 37.5% afterward). It allows a credit for 80% of foreign taxes. The new system also allows U.S. firms a deduction for foreign derived intangible income, or FDII, which was designed to reduce tax rates on foreign earnings from the use of intangible assets held in the United States. The deduction is 37.5% of this estimated income through 2025 and 21.875% afterward. Income from certain foreign sources earned by subsidiaries—which generally includes passive types of income, such as interest, dividends, annuities, rents, and royalties, and is referred to as Subpart F income—is generally taxed in the year it is earned and was retained by the Act. Subpart F applies only to shareholders who may be able to influence location decisions at the corporate level. These subsidiaries are referred to as controlled foreign corporations (CFCs). The Act also adopted the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse tax (BEAT), an alternative minimum tax with the tax based increased by certain payments to related foreign parties. Its primary focus was to address profit shifting between foreign parents and U.S. subsidiaries, but it applies in general. Notably, it excludes payments for costs of goods sold and for costs of services under some pricing rules. One way of shifting profits was to locate debt in high-tax countries. Preexisting thin capitalization rules limited interest to 50% of earnings before the deduction of interest, taxes, and amortization, deprec iation, and depletion (EBITA), although firms with a debt-to-asset rate of 1.5 or less were exempt. The new law adopted much stricter thin capitalization rules to prevent firms from deducting large amounts of interest. The new law lowers the cap to 30% of profits, eliminates the exemption based on the debt-to-asset ratio and, after 2021, measures the cap as a share of profits after amortization, depreciation, and depletion deductions. The Act also adopted some tax provisions targeted at discouraging inversions, which are discussed subsequently. A corporate inversion is a process by which an existing U.S. corporation changes its country of residence. After the inversion, the original U.S. corporation becomes a subsidiary of a foreign parent corporation. Corporate inversions occur through three different paths: the substantial activity test, merger with a larger foreign firm, and merger with a smaller foreign firm. Regardless of the form of the inversion, the typical result is that the new foreign parent company faces a lower home country tax rate and no tax on the company's foreign-source income. The U.S. firm can use inversions to reduce taxes using various techniques. Foreign operations in the future can be formed as subsidiaries of the new foreign parent in a country with a territorial tax, so that future foreign income can be exempt from tax. Accumulated and future foreign income from the U.S. company's foreign subsidiaries (which would be taxed by the United States if paid to the parent as a dividend) may be effectively repatriated tax free by lending or otherwise investing in the related foreign firm, such as a low-interest loan to the foreign parent holding company. These borrowed funds could then be used, for example, to pay dividends to shareholders or make loans to the U.S. firm. In addition, the combined firm can engage in \"earnings stripping\": reducing income in the U.S. firm by borrowing from the U.S. company and increasing interest deductions. For example, a foreign parent may lend to its U.S. subsidiary. This intercompany debt does not alter the overall company's debt, but does result in an interest expense in the United States (which reduces U.S. taxes paid) and an increased portion of company income being \"booked\" outside the United States. Royalty payments, management fees, and transfer pricing arrangements are other avenues for earnings stripping, but are thought to be of lesser importance than intercompany debt. In this form of inversion, a U.S. corporation with substantial business activity in a foreign company creates a foreign subsidiary. The U.S. corporation and foreign subsidiary exchange stock—resulting in each entity owning some of the other's stock. After the stock exchange, the new entity is a foreign corporation with a U.S. subsidiary, as the exchange is generally in proportion to the respective company valuations. As this form of inversion does not require any change in the effective control of the corporation, it is referred to as a \"naked inversion.\" In this form of inversion, a U.S. corporation would like to bolster its foreign operations and, perhaps, lower its U.S. tax. To do so, the U.S. corporation merges with a larger foreign corporation, with the U.S. shareholders owning a minority share of the new merged company. This results in the effective control of the new company being outside U.S. borders. While this form of inversion may be driven by business considerations, tax considerations may also be part of the decision. An example of this can be seen in the following statement by the board of directors of a U.S. corporation recommending approval of a merger with a U.K. corporation. The board of directors pursued the merger in part because Ensco was headquartered in a jurisdiction that has a favorable tax regime and an extensive network of tax treaties, which can allow the combined company to achieve a global effective tax rate comparable to Pride's competitors. In this case, a U.S. firm, Pride, merged with a U.K. firm, Ensco, and the headquarters remained in the U.K. In this form of inversion, a U.S. corporation would like to bolster its foreign operations and lower its U.S. tax. To do so, the U.S. corporation merges with a smaller foreign corporation, with the U.S. shareholders owning a majority share of the new merged company. This merger results in the effective control of the new company staying with the shareholders of the U.S. corporations. While this form of inversion may be driven by business considerations, tax considerations may also be part of the decision. An example is the Eaton Cooper merger. The following is an excerpt of a U.S. corporation's (Eaton's) press release announcing the acquisition of an Irish company (Cooper), with the company headquartering in Ireland (with a 12.5% tax rate and a territorial system). At the close of the transaction ... Eaton and Cooper will be combined under a new company incorporated in Ireland, where Cooper is incorporated today. The newly created company, which is expected to be called Eaton Global Corporation Plc or a variant thereof (\"New Eaton\"), will be led by Alexander M. Cutler, Eaton's current chairman and chief executive officer. At the close of the merger, it was expected that the shareholders of the U.S. company would control 73% of the combined company, with the shareholders of the Irish company controlling the remaining 27%. The press release notes expected tax benefits from the merger at $165 million in 2016, out of $535 million of total cost savings. In this case, a U.S. corporation used a merger to achieve an inversion while its shareholders retained a significant majority of shares. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, news reports drew the attention of policymakers and the public to a phenomenon sometimes called corporate \"inversions\" or \"expatriations\": instances where firms that consist of multiple corporations reorganize their structure so that the \"parent\" element of the group is a foreign corporation rather than a corporation chartered in the United States. Among the more high-profile inversions were Ingersoll-Rand, Tyco, the PXRE Group, Foster Wheeler, Nabors Industries, and Coopers Industries. These corporate inversions apparently involved few, if any, shifts in actual economic activity from the United States abroad, at least in the near term. In particular, inverted firms typically continued to maintain headquarters in the United States and did not systematically shift capital or employment abroad post inversion. Further, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands were the location of many of the newly created parent corporations—jurisdictions that have no corporate income tax but that also do have highly developed legal, institutional, and communications infrastructures. A 2002 study by the U.S. Treasury Department concluded that while inversions were not new—the statutory framework making them possible has long been in existence—there had been a \"marked increase\" in their frequency, size, and visibility. Taken together, these facts suggested that tax savings were one goal of the inversion, if not the primary goal. Beyond taxes, firms engaged in the inversions cited a number of reasons for undertaking them, including creating greater \"operational flexibility,\" improved cash management, and an enhanced ability to access international capital markets. The 2002 Treasury report identified three main concerns about corporate inversions: erosion of the U.S. tax base, a cost advantage for foreign-controlled firms, and a reduction in perceived fairness of the tax system. These concerns, along with a growing awareness of inversion transactions, may have resulted in congressional concern and debate about how to address the issues surrounding inversions, culminating with the enactment of an anti-inversion provision (Section 7874) in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA; P.L. 108-357 ). The AJCA adopted two alternative tax regimes applicable to inversions occurring after March 4, 2003. The AJCA treats the inverted foreign parent company as a domestic corporation if it is owned by at least 80% of the former parent's stockholders. In these cases, the AJCA would deny the firm any tax benefits of the inversion (i.e., it would continue to be taxed on the combined group's worldwide income). The second regime applies when there is at least 60% continuity of ownership but less than 80%. In this case, the new foreign parent is not taxed like a domestic corporation, but any U.S. toll taxes (taxes on gains) that apply to transfers of assets to the new entity are not permitted to be offset by foreign tax credits or net operating losses. The AJCA also exempted corporations with substantial economic activity in the foreign country from the anti-inversion provisions, but it did not define substantial business activity in the statute. Although the 2004 act largely eliminated the generic naked inversions, two alternatives remained that allowed a firm to shift headquarters and retain control of the business: the naked inversion via the business activity exemption, and merger with a smaller company. Using the business activity route would require significant economic operations in the target country. An inversion by merger would require a large firm that would be at least 25% of the size of the U.S. firm. The post-2004 approaches to inversions no longer involved countries such as Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, but larger countries with substantial economic activity such as the U.K., Canada, and Ireland. The U.K., in particular, has become a much more attractive headquarters. Because of freedom of movement rules in the European Union, the U.K. cannot have anti-inversion laws, which may have played a role in both moving to a territorial tax and lowering the corporate tax rate. A 2012 report in the Wall Street Journal highlighted some recent moves abroad. This report claimed 10 companies had inverted since 2009, with 6 within the past year or so. This was a small number of companies, but it is useful to look at the methods involved. The Wall Street Journal article identified by name 5 of the 10 companies that had moved abroad recently: Aon, ENSCO, Rowan, Eaton, and DE Master Blenders 1763. (The article also referred to Transocean and Weatherford International, but these were firms that had inverted before the 2004 legislation: Transocean first to the Cayman Islands, and then Switzerland, and Weatherford first to Bermuda, and then Switzerland.) The remaining firm mentioned in the Wall Street Journal article is Eaton. Eaton's move abroad was a merger; it merged with Coopers, a firm effectively operating its headquarters in the United States, but one that had inverted prior to the 2004 law change. An article by Bret Wells identified Aon, ENSCO, and Rowan as having inverted via the substantial business activity exemption (where the only apparent objective is tax savings). All three moved to the United Kingdom, where a recent move to a territorial tax, as well as decisions in the European Court of Justice that limited their anti-abuse rules, had made their tax system more attractive. The U.K. was also in the process of lowering its own corporate rate. Two of the firms are oil drilling firms; drilling in the North Sea might have affected their ability to use this exemption. Aon is an insurance firm. Wells mentions another firm, Tim Hortons, which also used a naked inversion using the substantial business activity exemption in 2009 to relocate to Canada. In doing so, the firm was returning to its origins, as it was founded in Canada. It became an American company when Wendy's acquired it in 1995, but it was subsequently spun off in 2006. DE Master Blenders 1763, like Tim Hortons, was returning to its origins as well (a Netherlands firm), as it was spun off from Sara Lee, which had acquired it in 1978. In response to increased use of the substantial business activity exemption, Treasury Regulations (T.D. 9592, June 12, 2012) increased the safe harbor for the substantial business activities test from 10% to 25%, effectively closing off this avenue in the future. This action could be done by regulation because the statute did not specify how the substantial business activity test was to be implemented. A number of mergers have either been effectuated or were proposed: Chiquita, Actavis, and Perrigo (the latter two are pharmaceutical firms) moving to Ireland; Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Endo Health Services moving to Canada; and Liberty Global (a cable company) to the U.K. Subsequently, the new Irish firm Actavis (itself the result of two prior mergers) merged with Forest Labs. Omnicom (an advertising firm) planned a move to the U.K. (after proposed merger with a French firm, creating a Netherlands holding company, resident in the U.K. for tax purposes), but has abandoned its merger. Chiquita canceled its plans after Treasury regulations were issued in September 2014. Most of these firms are not household names or industry giants. Thus, perhaps none created as much interest as the attempt by pharmacy giant Pfizer to acquire AstraZeneca with a U.K. headquarters, or the urging of some stockholders of Walgreens to invert to Switzerland. Pfizer represented a significant potential loss of future tax revenue, as much as $1.4 billion per year. According to a study by Martin Sullivan, in 2005, when a temporary tax exclusion of 85% of dividends (the repatriation holiday) was in force, Pfizer repatriated $37 billion, the single largest amount of repatriations of any firm. In 2009, Pfizer repatriated $34 billion (and paid U.S. taxes on that amount) to finance the acquisition of Wyeth, but earnings abroad grew from $42 billion in 2009 (after the repatriation) to $73 billion by 2012. These earnings have not been repatriated and taxed in the United States. An inversion by Pfizer would, however, result in current shareholders paying capital gains taxes on any stock appreciation when they are converted into shares of the new company. Shares held in IRAs and 401(k)s would not typically owe this tax, but shares owned directly by individuals and in mutual funds would owe tax even if they did not sell their stock. Policymakers and the public remained interested in the issue of inversions through 2014. Although the initial Pfizer merger did not occur, the spate of mergers or proposed mergers in the medical device and pharmaceuticals industries continued in 2014. One example included one of the largest proposed mergers yet, AbbVie's acquisition of Shire, an Irish firm. The announcement of a proposed merger between Burger King and Tim Hortons also generated interest in the issue. As is the case with Chiquita, AbbVie canceled its plans after the issuance of Treasury regulations in September 2014, but Burger King planned to complete its merger and did so on December 12, 2014. Treasury continues to regulate inversions where regulations are possible. For example, in 2014 it took action to close a loophole stemming from the coordination of two sets of regulations—the \"Anti-Killer B Regulations\" and the \"Helen of Troy Anti-Inversion Regulations\"—that allowed Liberty Global shareholders to avoid some capital gains taxes. In response to the new wave of inversions, the Treasury Department released a notice of regulatory actions that would restrict inversions and their benefits. Treasury news releases, however, indicated that legislative action is the only way to fully rein in these transactions. Following this notice, several firms announced they were canceling plans to merge, and one firm, Medtronic, announced a change in financing plans (no longer using earnings abroad to pay acquisition costs). Other firms, however, have announced inversion plans. There is no way to know how many unannounced mergers were, or will be, prevented by these regulations. The regulatory actions address two basic aspects of inversions. One set of changes limits the ability to access the accumulated deferred earnings of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. firms. The second regulatory action restricts certain techniques used in inversion transactions that allowed firms to qualify with less than 80% ownership. This regulation is effective for inversions that closed on or after September 22, 2014. The regulations do not prevent inversions via merger and do not address earnings stripping by shifting debt to the U.S. firm, although Treasury has indicated future action in this area. In an inversion, the foreign subsidiaries of the original U.S. firm remain subsidiaries so that any dividends paid to the U.S. parent would be taxed. Regulations also treat other direct investments in U.S. property, such as loans to the U.S. parent, as dividends. Once a firm has inverted and the U.S. firm is now a subsidiary of a foreign parent, there are methods of accessing the earnings of overseas subsidiaries by transactions between the new foreign parent and the U.S. firm's foreign subsidiaries. The regulation is intended to address three such methods. First, the regulation prevents the access to funds by, for example, a loan from the U.S. company's foreign subsidiary to the new foreign parent (called \"hopscotching\"). Before the regulation, funds of this type could have been used to pay dividends to the individual shareholders or for other purposes. Under the regulation, acquiring any obligation (such as a loan) or stock of a foreign related person is treated as U.S. property subject to tax. Second, the regulation addresses \"decontrolling,\" where the foreign acquiring corporation issues a note or transfer of property for stock in the U.S. firm's foreign subsidiaries. If a majority of stock is obtained, the U.S. firm's subsidiary is no longer a controlled foreign corporation (CFC) and not subject to Subpart F, which taxes currently certain passive or easily shifted income. However, even a less than majority share can allow partial access to deferred earnings without a U.S. tax. This regulation prevents this by treating acquisition of foreign subsidiary stock as acquisition of stock in the U.S. parent. Third, the regulation addresses transactions where the foreign acquiring corporation sells stock of the former U.S. parent corporation to that U.S. parent corporation's CFC in exchange for property or cash. If such a transaction is structured properly, some interpretations of the old regulations would have permitted the income to avoid taxation. The new regulations would prevent that and would apply regardless of the firm's inversion status. A firm can realize the tax benefits of an inversion only if the shareholders of the original U.S. firm retain, after the merger, less than 80% of the ownership in the new company. The regulation contains several provisions that limit certain techniques for achieving this goal. The avoidance techniques include inflating the foreign firm, shrinking the U.S. firm, and inverting only part of the U.S. firm. First, it prevents firms from reaching the less than 80% goal by inflating the size of the foreign merger partner (which must have more than 20% ownership subsequent to the merger) by use of passive assets (e.g., an interest bearing bank deposit). This notice disregards passive assets of the foreign firm if more than 50% of its value is in passive assets. (Banks and financial service companies are excluded.) Second, it prevents firms from shrinking the size of the U.S. firm by paying extraordinary dividends before the merger. The notice disregards this reduction in value. Third, it prevents an inversion of part of a U.S. company (a \"spinversion\") by spinning it off to a newly formed foreign corporation, by treating the new \"foreign\" company as a domestic corporation. After the 2014 Treasury regulations were issued, some firms revised their plans, and the pace of inversions slowed. Some mergers were structured to avoid the anti-inversion rules and Treasury regulations, by an ownership share of less than 60%. Among what appear to be inversions is the merger of telecom firm Arris and Pace (a U.K. firm), CF Industries (fertilizer) and OCI NB (a Netherlands firm), Terex with Konecranes (a Finnish firm), and a consolidation of European Coca-Cola bottling firms (one such firm, Coca-Cola Enterprises, was a U.S. headquartered firm). Waste Connections Inc. merged with Progressive Waste Solutions Ltd (a Canadian Firm), with 70% ownership and a headquarters in Canada. Monsanto's proposal to merge with Syngenta (a Swiss firm) was called off. Some mergers that did not qualify as inversions under the tax law also occurred. The most significant in size was the proposed Pfizer merger. On November 23, 2015, Pfizer announced a proposed merger with Allergan, an Irish company, and the move of its headquarters to Ireland. This merger, which would result in the largest pharmaceutical company in the world, is not covered under the anti-inversion rules because Pfizer will own 56% of the value of the new firm. Allergan itself is the product of a merger involving both stock and cash acquisition by Actavis in 2015, with former Allergen shareholders owning a minority of the new company. Thus, this merger as well was not an inversion under the tax law. Actavis, in turn, was a former U.S. firm that inverted by merger with Warner Chillcott, an Irish firm, in 2013 (where the former shareholders of the U.S. firm acquired 77% of the stock). Pfizer terminated its merger with Allergen after the April 4, 2016, regulations (discussed below). Other notable mergers not subject to anti-inversion rules were the acquisition of Salix, a pharmaceutical company, by Valeant (a Canadian company); the acquisition of Auxilium by Endo (after Auxilium backed out of an inversion with Canadian firm QLT); the merger of Cyberonics with Italy's Sorin (to be headquartered in the U.K.); and the merger of Broadcom (a chipmaker) with Avago (a Singapore firm). Information and analytics provider HIS announced a merger with Markit Ltd, a U.K. firm, to be headquartered in the U.K., but the ownership share of HIS would be less than 60% of the firm. Johnson Controls also merged with Tyco, one of the earlier inverted firms. The 2015 Treasury regulations appear to have more limited consequences for inversions than the 2014 regulations did. Three regulatory changes were made by the notice. First, in the case where the foreign parent is a tax resident of a third country, stock issued by that parent to the existing foreign firm will be disregarded for purposes of the ownership requirement. That change will prevent a U.S. firm from merging with a partner and then choosing a tax friendly third country to headquarter in. The second provision would clarify the so called \"anti-stuffing\" rules, where the foreign firm's size is inflated by adding assets to that firm. The notice clarifies that this rule applies to any assets, not just passive assets. Third, the current business activity exception requires 25% of business activity to be in the foreign country where the new parent is created or organized, but does not require it to be a foreign parent. This rule requires the business activity to be in the foreign parent. It prevents inversion based on the business activity test when the foreign parent has a tax residence in another country without substantial business activities. On April 4, 2016, the Treasury Department issued temporary and proposed regulations formalizing rules contained in Notices 2014-52 and 2015-79 limiting corporate tax inversions, as well as adding new rules addressing inversions and earnings-stripping transactions. In response to these new regulations, the proposed merger between Pfizer and Allergen PLC has been terminated. The April 4, 2016, Treasury regulations put in place several anti-inversion rules that target groups that have engaged in a series of inversion or acquisition transactions as well as a rule that restricts postinversion asset dilution. The temporary regulations target inversion transactions involving a new foreign parent that previously acquired one or more U.S. entities in inversions or acquisitions in which the new foreign parent issued stock. These prior acquisitions would generally increase the value of the foreign entity, enabling it to subsequently engage in an inversion transaction with a larger U.S. company while remaining below the 60% or 80% ownership thresholds. The temporary regulations disregard stock of the new foreign parent to the extent the value of such stock is attributable to its prior U.S. entity acquisitions during the prior three years. According to analysis by Americans for Tax Fairness, the implementation of this rule would have increased Pfizer's share of the merged company to roughly 70% from 56% prior to the rule. Similar to the multiple domestic entity acquisition rule, the multiple-step acquisition rule targets certain inversions that are structured as back-to-back foreign acquisitions. Specifically, it targets transactions that are part of a plan in which a foreign corporation acquires substantially all of the assets of a U.S. entity and, subsequent to this first acquisition, a second foreign corporation acquires substantially all of the assets of the first foreign corporation. The temporary regulations, under certain circumstances, treat each acquisition as an acquisition of a U.S. entity that may be subject to anti-inversion rules. Unlike the multiple domestic entity acquisition rule, which has a three-year look-back period, the multiple-step acquisition rule can be applied to all acquisitions that are part of the same plan regardless of time. A third rule modified existing regulations to restrict the ability of inverted companies to avoid paying tax on unrealized gains (under Section 965) through a transfer to a controlled foreign corporation (CFC) (under Section 351). This would address situations where a CFC of an inverted U.S. company engages in a postinversion exchange that could dilute a U.S. shareholder's indirect interest in the exchanged asset, allowing the U.S. shareholder to avoid U.S. tax on any realized gain in the asset that is not recognized at the time of the transfer. The rule requires a CFC of an inverted U.S. group to recognize all realized gain with respect to any such postinversion Section 351 exchange. The earnings-stripping regulations aim to restrict the ability of foreign-parent groups to shift earnings out of the United States through dividends or other economically similar transactions (under Section 385). In these cases certain related-party debt will be characterized as equity for tax purposes. The result of equity classification is that interest deductions will be disallowed, and withholding obligations of 30% (or lower rate based on an applicable income tax treaty) could ensue. The regulations do not normally apply for related-party debt that is incurred to fund actual business investment, such as building or equipping a factory. The regulations also require documentation of debt instruments issued and held by certain members of an expanded group to establish that such instruments are properly characterized as debt. The regulations also allow the IRS on audit to treat an instrument issued to a related party as in part debt and in part equity. The final regulations issued on October 21, 2016, scaled back the original regulations in response to the comment period. The final regulations removed the general bifurcation rule that would have allowed a debt instrument to be classified as part debt and part equity and an exemption for debt for foreign issuers. The rules also provided exemptions for cash pools (a pool of cash to be accessed for short-term needs), short-term loans, regulated financial entities, and pass-throughs (firms not taxed as corporations). The Treasury delayed documentation rules for a year on July 28, 2017. Treasury announced on July 7, 2017, that these debt-equity regulations were to be among eight rules targeted for review. The Treasury issued final regulations for the temporary regulations introduced in April 2016 on July 12, 2018, as TD 9834 with minor changes. Two days after the regulations were issued, Pfizer withdrew from its merger with Allergen, an Irish-based company that was an inverted firm. It appears that this merger was affected by the multiple-entity rule, which has come to be called \"serial inversion.\" Mergers between Shire (Ireland based) and Basalta, and between HIS and Markit Group Inc. (U.K. based) went forward. The CF Industries merger with OCI NV (based in the Netherlands) was also called off; Johnson Controls and Tyco went forward. A merger between Konecranes (a Finnish firm) and Terex was scaled down to an acquisition of a share of Terex with the U.S. firm owning 25%, thus avoiding the effect of regulations. In May 2016 Cardtronics, Inc., an ATM operator, announced a plan to move to the U.K. using the substantial business activities test. Also in May, an oil and gas industry service and technology firm announced a merger with Technip SA (France) to form a U.K. company, with each firm holding about half the stock and thus avoiding any of the recent regulations and establishing a new headquarters in another country. In 2017, Praxaire (a U.S. industrial gas company) announced a merger with Linde AG (a German gas and technology company), also with each owning half of the new company. As noted in the introduction, statistical data suggest a decline in inversions from 2015 to 2016, and again from 2016 to 2017, and these data are consistent with the limited news reports of major inversions. Pfizer's CEO has recently indicated that deals are on hold generally while tax reform is being considered. The 2017 legislation not only made fundamental changes to the overall treatment of corporate income at home and abroad, but also adopted several provisions specifically aimed at inverted corporations (those with 60% to 80% ownership). Under the new law, existing untaxed earnings held abroad are taxed under a deemed repatriation rule, but at a lower rate (8% for earnings reinvested in noncash assets and 15.5% for earnings held as cash or cash equivalents). A special recapture rule applies on deemed repatriations of newly inverted firms. This recapture rule applies if a firm first becomes an expatriated entity at any time during the 10-year period beginning on December 22, 2017. In this case, the tax will be increased from 8% and 15.5% to 35% tax for the entire deemed repatriation, with no foreign tax credit allowed for the increase in tax rate. The additional tax is due on the full amount of the deemed repatriation in the first tax year in which the taxpayer becomes an expatriated entity. BEAT excludes payments which reduce gross receipts with the result that payment for the cost of goods sold is not included under BEAT. An exception applies for firms that invert after November 9, 2017, where payments to a foreign parent or any foreign firm in the affiliated for cost of goods sold is included in BEAT. The constructive ownership rules for purposes of determining 10% U.S. shareholders, whether a corporation is a CFC and whether parties satisfy certain relatedness tests, were expanded in the 2017 tax revision. Specifically, the new law treats stock owned by a foreign person as attributable to a U.S. entity owned by the foreign person (so-called \"downward attribution\"). As a result, stock owned by a foreign person may generally be attributed to (1) a U.S. corporation, 10% of the value of the stock of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by the foreign person; (2) a U.S. partnership in which the foreign person is a partner; and (3) certain U.S. trusts if the foreign person is a beneficiary or, in certain circumstances, a grantor or a substantial owner. The downward attribution rule was originally conceived to deal with inversions. In an inversion, without downward attribution, a subsidiary of the original U.S. parent could lose CFC status if it sold enough stock to the new foreign parent so the U.S. parent no longer had majority ownership. With downward attribution, the ownership of stock by the new foreign parent in the CFC is attributed to the U.S. parent, so that the subsidiary continues its CFC status, making it subject to any tax rules that apply to CFCs (such as Subpart F and repatriation taxes under the old law, and Subpart F and GILTI under the new law). Dividends (like capital gains) are allowed lower tax rates than the rates applied to ordinary income. The rates are 0%, 15%, and 20% depending on the rate bracket that ordinary income falls into. Certain dividends received from foreign firms (those that do not have tax treaties and PFICs ) are not eligible for these lower rates. Dividends paid by firms that inverted after the date of enactment of P.L. 115-97 are added to the list of those not eligible for the lower rates. In 2004, an excise tax of 15% was imposed on stock compensation received by insiders in an expatriated corporation; the new law increases it to 20%, effective on the date of enactment for corporations that first become expatriated after that date. As noted earlier, there are no aggregate data available yet for 2018, but there are also indications that most tax-motivated inversions had already been discouraged by the 2016 regulations. Considering announcements of individual companies, one planned inversion, by Assurant, Inc. was revised to retain the headquarters in the United States. Ohio-based Dana, Inc. announced plans to merge and move the headquarters to the U.K., although the merger would leave the U.S. shareholders with less than 60% ownership, and therefore not make them subject to anti-inversion penalties. A recent announcement indicated that the Dana merger was called off. Some firms may be considering reversing their headquarters decisions. The AJCA was successful at limiting a form of inversions, at least initially. In particular, the AJCA stopped the practice of basic \"naked inversions,\" in which little activity or presence in the new jurisdiction is required and the new parent is domiciled in a tax haven. Further, through regulation, Treasury has limited the use of the substantial business activity test safe harbor to invert. Recent activity (as noted above), however, suggests that mergers continued to be used as a vehicle for corporate inversions after these changes. These more recent mergers have increasingly resulted in a U.K. parent company (e.g., FMC-Technip, HIS-Markit), due to policy decisions by the U.K. government. Specifically, the U.K. lowered its corporate tax rate and adopted a territorial tax system. In addition, anti-abuse provisions for foreign source income were weakened by the European Union courts. The U.K. has also proposed taxing certain intangible income at a 10% rate. (This is referred to as a patent box.) To restrict the occurrence of tax-motivated inversions, both a general reform of the U.S. corporate tax and specific provisions to deal with tax-motivated international mergers were discussed. Some important changes were made in 2017; other options remain. Interest in reforming the corporate income tax was long-standing, including calling for explicit accommodation of international concerns. As noted earlier, two aspects of the U.S. corporate tax system are particularly relevant to corporate location decisions: the corporate tax rate and the taxation of foreign-source earnings. Taken together, these factors, under prior law, could yield a substantial reduction in taxes paid. In the case of the proposed merger of Forest Laboratories Inc. (a U.S. company) and Actavis (an Irish company) in 2014, the tax reduction was estimated to be roughly $100 million per year. Prior to the 2017 changes, the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate was higher than both the average statutory rates of the other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and that of the 15 largest economies in the world. Many asserted that the U.S. statutory tax rate needed to be lowered to reduce the incentive for inversion transactions. With the rate lowered from 35% to 21%, the combined central and subnational corporate tax rates are similar to most rates in the OECD. While lowering the corporate tax rate would reduce the incentive to invert, there are reasons to suggest that it would be impractical to reduce the rate to the level needed to stop inversions. Namely, to stop inversions through a reduction in the corporate tax rate would require a U.S. corporate tax rate set equal to the lowest tax rate of a destination company, or zero. A lower corporate tax rate alone reduced the incentive for corporate inversions, primarily by reducing the tax rate applied to repatriated earnings. For a company like Pfizer, with large foreign earnings, a rate reduction could yield significantly lower taxes paid. However, as discussed below, the benefit of a lowered rate is negligible relative to the benefit to corporate taxpayers afforded by territorial tax systems, when income earned in low- or no-tax foreign jurisdictions is never subject to U.S. tax. Two factors present challenges for lowering the corporate tax rate further. First, if revenue neutrality is a goal, there may not be enough base-broadening provisions with revenue offsets to provide deep cuts in the corporate tax; and, if such offsets were found, they might have their own consequences for investment. Reducing the corporate tax without corresponding base broadening would likely reduce corporate tax revenue, adding to chronic budget deficits. Prior to the 2017 revision, the United States was one of the few countries that had a worldwide tax system and levied a tax on the foreign-source income of domestic corporations. Changing corporate tax residence to a country with a territorial tax system (where foreign earnings would not be taxed at all) was thought to drive inversion decisions. This issue led to proposals for the United States to adopt a territorial tax system to stop inversion transactions. One concern about adopting a territorial tax system is the strain it would likely place on the current transfer pricing system. From this perspective, the worldwide tax system provided a backstop on the amount of profit shifting or base erosion possible, because shifted profits will eventually be repatriated. Under a territorial tax system, this is not the case. Research has found evidence of significant profit shifting, especially related to mobile intellectual property, suggesting a lot of income from foreign sources is really U.S. income in disguise. Numerous other issues surround the adoption of a U.S. territorial tax. For example, while some supported a territorial tax to eliminate the incentive to keep earnings abroad, others opposed it because it likely discourages domestic investment and activity in the United States. The revisions in 2017 maintained a worldwide system, but with some changes. Income from U.S. subsidiaries is taxed on a current basis but at a lower rate and with an exemption for a deemed return on tangible assets. It also provided a subsidy for locating intangible assets with earnings from abroad in the United States. Many of the inverting firms had significant intangible assets, and it is not clear whether this new regime (a lower tax rate but on a current basis) is more or less generous to firms considering inverting. Moving closer to a pure territorial tax, as in the case of a rate reduction, would likely reduce corporate tax revenue and add to current budget pressures unless it is offset by other tax increases, although this effect would be less costly at the lower 21% tax rate. In 2027, GILTI is projected to raise $21 billion. GILTI could be retained and the rate lowered or the temporarily lower rate could be made permanent. There has been some agreement that adopting a territorial tax without some significant anti-abuse provisions could be problematic, as it would likely increase profit shifting abroad by U.S. firms. Evidence suggests that administrative remedies were successful at dramatically slowing inversions; the targeted legislative changes in the 2017 Act may have had some impact as well. There are further changes that could be made to discourage inversions. This section discusses the history of these proposals, both legislative and administrative. One approach would be to extend the rate recapture enacted in the 2017 Act for a period longer than 10 years, or to make it apply indefinitely to future inversions. A second alternative is to directly restrict the ability of U.S. firms to invert by merger. The President's FY2015, FY2016, and FY2017 budget proposals contained a provision that would have further restricted the use of inversions. The proposal would modify the 80% test enacted in the AJCA to a 50% test and eliminate the 60% test. In effect, this proposal would reduce the percentage of shareholders that are owners of the \"old U.S. company\" and the \"new foreign merged company.\" The proposal would also require that the new foreign corporation be managed and controlled from outside the United States and prohibit transactions where the new foreign company has substantial business activities in the United States. In November 2015, then-Senate Finance Committee Chairman Hatch indicated the possibility of adding an anti-inversion provision to legislation to extend expired provisions. Many of these bills were introduced in the 115 th Congress. H.R. 1931 (Doggett), the Corporate EXIT Fairness Act, and H.R. 3434 (Levin) and S. 1636 (Durbin, along with a number of cosponsors), the Stop Corporate Inversions Act, would have treated all mergers as U.S. firms when the U.S. firm's shareholders hold more than 50% or when management and control primarily takes place in the United States. H.R. 1932 (Doggett) and S. 851 (Whitehouse), as with bills introduced in the 114 th Congress, would have included anti-inversion provisions as part of a broader proposal to address tax havens and deferral. H.R. 3603 (Levin) would have addressed earnings stripping of inverted corporations. H.R. 3424 (DeLauro) would disallow federal contracts for inverted firms. H.R. 1451 (Schakowsky) and S. 586 (Sanders) would make major changes in the tax treatment of foreign source income and include anti-inversion rules. Following the change in the international system adopted at the end of 2017, Representative Doggett and Senator Whitehouse introduced the \"No Tax Break for Outsourcing Act\" ( H.R. 5108 , S. 2459 ) which, in addition to other changes, would have treated foreign corporations that are managed and controlled in the United States as domestic corporations and treated inverted firms as U.S. firms when the shareholders of the former U.S. company own more than 50% of the shares. These bills would have also limited interest deductions in the United States to the proportionate share of the firm's assets. The last proposal (to allocate worldwide interest) was in both the House and Senate versions of the legislation ( H.R. 1 ; 115 th Congress) in somewhat different form but was not retained in the final legislation. While this proposal was not specifically targeted at inverted firms it would have increased the restrictions that limit earnings stripping. Former President Obama had encouraged Congress to act directly to limit inversions, but had also indicated on August 6, 2014, that administrative changes to limit inversions were under examination. Prior to that announcement, Steve Shay, a Harvard professor and former practitioner and Treasury official, outlined two regulatory actions that he believed could be taken. The first would limit earnings stripping by reclassifying debt as equity due to excessive related party debt in an inversion. (The second provision is no longer relevant under the new international tax regime.) A number of other administrative proposals that have been suggested (such as provisions relating to taxing accumulated deferred earnings) are no longer relevant and others have been adopted in the regulatory changes discussed above. Expanding the scope of Section 7874 (which treats inverted firms as U.S. firms) by combining multiple transactions into single ones, or vice versa. The scope of Section 7874 could also be expanded by treating certain stock as disqualified (because it is expected to be held temporarily or because it is accompanied by restrictions on voting rights); this provision was adopted in Treasury regulations; Potentially recognizing accumulated deferred earnings as currently taxable under authority such as Subpart F, Section 367, or other rules (this provision is no longer relevant with the end of deferral, but it may have influenced the decision to tax deferred earnings of newly inverted firms at the full 35% rate for the next 10 years); Issuing regulations that would generally tighten restrictions on interest deductions under the thin capitalization rules of Section 163(j). These changes would probably apply to corporations in general, and not just to inverted corporations (this change was made in the 2017 tax revision); Stricter regulations under Section 367 to immediately include foreign earnings in the case of actions that attempt to move foreign operations out from under the U.S. parent. This would make future earnings of these operations nontaxable; Strengthening and modernizing the effectively connected income rules that determined whether trade or business activity is taking place in the United States by foreign firms; and Closely monitoring the creation of non-U.S. subsidiaries owned by the foreign parent after inversion, and ensuring that assets (including intangibles such as inventions, knowhow, etc.) transferred from the U.S. firm are transferred at arms-length prices. There is disagreement among experts about whether the types of regulatory changes discussed in this section are feasible or desirable. A number of legislative proposals were advanced in 2014, when the wave of inversions through merger began. Representative Levin, the ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, introduced the Stop Corporate Inversions Act of 2014 ( H.R. 4679 ), which would have reflected the Administration's proposed changes, retroactive to May 8, 2014. The inversion would have not been recognized if the U.S. stockholders had 50% of the shares or if 25% of the business activity is in the United States. A companion bill, which would have sunset in two years to provide time for tax reform, was introduced in the Senate by Senator Levin in 2014 ( S. 2360 ). The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated the permanent proposal to gain $19.5 billion in revenue over FY2015-FY2024. The two-year proposal would have raise $0.8 billion over the same period. In the 114 th Congress, these legislative proposals were introduced as H.R. 415 (Levin) and S. 198 (Durbin). Senator Casey proposed an anti-inversion amendment to an education bill ( S. 1177 ). In the 114 th Congress, H.R. 297 (Doggett) and S. 174 (Whitehouse) included anti-inversion provisions as part of a broader proposal to address tax haven abuses and restrict the benefits of deferral. S. 922 (Sanders) and H.R. 1790 (Schakowsky) also included anti-inversion provisions, as well as earnings-stripping provisions (discussed below) and broader provisions, including the repeal of deferral. In 2014 a number of legislative proposals were introduced that would limit the tax benefits associated with inversions for certain corporations. For example, H.R. 1554 (Doggett), H.R. 3666 (DeLauro), H.R. 3793 (Maffei), S. 268 (Levin), S. 1533 (Levin), and S. 1844 (Shaheen) would each treat corporations managed and controlled from the United States as domestic corporations regardless of their legal tax home or status as an inverted company. This provision was also included in S. 922 (Sanders) and H.R. 1790 (Schakowsky). Other proposals in 2014, H.R. 694 (Schakowsky) and S. 250 (Sanders), would have eliminated deferral (taxing foreign source income currently), in addition to limiting the benefits of inversions when management and control continues to reside in the United States. Legislative proposals were also under discussion in 2014 by Representative Levin (announced July 31, 2014) and by Senator Schumer (announced August 14, 2014) to address earnings stripping, where foreign parent companies borrow from the U.S. subsidiary to increase interest deductions and reduce taxable income in the United States. Both of these proposals would have tightened the rules allowing interest deductions by reducing the current limit on interest deductions relative to adjusted income from 50% to 25% and repealing an alternative safe-harbor debt-to-equity test. Both proposals would have also eliminated or limited interest carryforwards. The Schumer proposal was intended to apparently apply to inverted firms while the Levin proposal would have applied generally. The Levin proposal would have also limited other transactions between related parties within the firm that allow untaxed investment of funds in the United States. The restrictions on interest in the Levin bill were the same as those initially proposed in the House in 2004. Senator Schumer introduced his proposal, S. 2786 , the Corporate Inverters Earnings Stripping Reform Act of 2014. Its limits on interest deductions would have applied to inverted firms where U.S. shareholders own more than 50% of the firm. The restriction also would have applied to firms that inverted using the substantial business activities test. The bill had nine Democratic cosponsors; five of them were on the Senate Finance Committee. In the 114 th Congress, S. 922 (Sanders) and H.R. 1790 (Schakowsky) included general earnings-stripping provisions for firms with a foreign parent. Earnings stripping provisions were also addressed in the report of the Senate Finance Committee's working group on Tax Reform. H.R. 5278 (DeLauro) and S. 2704 (Levin), introduced May 30, 2014, would have disallowed awarding federal contracts to inverted firms. These proposals were introduced in the 114 th Congress as H.R. 1809 (DeLauro) and S. 975 (Durbin). In 2014, Senators Brown and Durbin proposed S. 2895 , and Representative Doggett introduced H.R. 5549 , the Pay What You Owe Before You Go Act, that would have taxed the accumulated deferred earnings of inverting firms. Then Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden had proposed having draft legislation in place in September 2014, and also referred to Schumer's earnings-stripping proposal. Senator Wyden had previously announced that any changes would be retroactive to May 8, 2014.\n\nNow, write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nSummary:", "summary_gt": "", "input_tokens": 9255, "output_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 9255, "source_file": "gov_report.jsonl"}
{"article": "You are given a report by a government agency. Write a one-page summary of the report.\n\nReport:\nSince 2001, the United States has made a commitment to building Afghanistan’s security and governance in order to prevent the country from once again becoming a sanctuary for terrorists. To achieve its security objectives, the United States currently has two missions in Afghanistan: a counterterrorism mission that it leads and the NATO-led Resolute Support train, advise, and assist mission, which it participates in with other coalition nations. The objective of Resolute Support, according to DOD reporting, is to establish self-sustaining Afghan security ministries and forces that work together to maintain security in Afghanistan. The United States is conducting these missions within a challenging security environment that has deteriorated since the January 2015 transition to Afghan-led security. The United Nations reported nearly 24,000 security incidents in Afghanistan in 2017—the most ever recorded—and, despite a slight decrease in the overall number of security incidents in early 2018, the United Nations noted significant security challenges, including a spike in high-casualty attacks in urban areas and coordinated attacks by the insurgency on ANDSF checkpoints. DOD provides both personnel and funding to support its efforts in Afghanistan. DOD documents indicate that the United States contributes more troops to Resolute Support than any other coalition nation. As of May 2018, the United States was contributing 54 percent of Resolute Support military personnel, according to DOD reporting. Of the approximately 14,000 U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan as of June 2018, about 8,500 were assigned to Resolute Support to train, advise, and assist the ANDSF, according to DOD reporting. For fiscal year 2018, Congress appropriated about $4.67 billion for the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund—the primary mechanism of U.S. financial support for manning, training, and equipping the ANDSF. Other international donors provided about $800 million, and the Afghan government committed to providing about $500 million, according to DOD reporting. Under Resolute Support and the International Security Assistance Force mission that preceded it, CSTC-A is the DOD organization responsible for (1) overseeing efforts to equip and train the ANA and ANP; (2) validating requirements, including equipment requirements; (3) validating existing supply levels; (4) submitting requests to DOD components to contract for procurement of materiel for the ANDSF; and (5) ensuring that the Afghan government appropriately uses and accounts for U.S. funds provided as direct contributions from the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund. OSD-P is responsible for developing policy on and conducting oversight of the bilateral security relationship with Afghanistan focused on efforts to develop the Afghan security ministries and their forces. In August 2017, we reported that the United States had spent almost $18 billion on equipment and transportation for the ANDSF from fiscal years 2005 through April 2017, representing the second-largest expenditure category from the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund. In that report, we identified six types of key equipment the United States funded for the ANDSF in fiscal years 2003 through 2016, including approximately: 600,000 weapons, such as rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers, shotguns, and pistols; 163,000 tactical and nontactical radios, such as handheld radios and 76,000 vehicles, such as Humvees, trucks, recovery vehicles, and mine resistant ambush protected vehicles; 30,000 equipment items for detecting and disposing of explosives, such as bomb disposal robots and mine detectors; 16,000 equipment items for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, such as unmanned surveillance drones and night vision devices; and 208 aircraft, such as helicopters, light attack aircraft, and cargo airplanes. The Ministry of Defense oversees the ANA, and the Ministry of the Interior oversees the ANP. According to DOD reporting, the authorized force level for the ANDSF, excluding civilians, as of June 2018 was 352,000: 227,374 for the Ministry of Defense and 124,626 for the Ministry of Interior. The ANA includes the ANA corps, Afghan Air Force, Special Mission Wing, ANA Special Operations Command, and Ktah Khas (counterterrorism forces). The ANP includes the Afghan Uniformed Police, Afghan Anti-Crime Police, Afghan Border Police, Public Security Police, Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan, and General Command of Police Special Units. The ANA Special Mission Wing, Ktah Khas, ANA Special Operations Command, and ANP General Command of Police Special Units are collectively referred to as the Afghan Special Security Forces. In this report, we refer to the Afghan Air Force and the Afghan Special Security Forces as specialized forces, and the other components of the ANDSF as conventional forces. According to DOD reporting, the combined authorized force level for the specialized forces as of June 2018 was approximately 34,500, or about 10 percent of the ANDSF’s total authorized force level of 352,000, compared with the conventional forces, which make up about 74 percent of the total authorized force level for the ANDSF. Figure 1 shows the ANDSF’s organization. U.S. and coalition advisors from Resolute Support focus on capacity building at the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Interior, and ANDSF regional headquarters, according to DOD reporting. Ministerial advisors are located at Resolute Support headquarters in Kabul. At the ministerial level, advisors provide assistance to improve institutional capabilities, focusing on several functional areas. Table 1 summarizes the indicators of effectiveness that ministerial advisors are to use to measure ministerial progress in developing functioning systems that can effectively execute each of the functional areas. Regional Resolute Support advisors from seven advising centers located throughout Afghanistan provide support to nearby ANA corps and ANP zone headquarters personnel, according to DOD reporting. Some advisors are embedded with their ANDSF counterparts, providing a continuous coalition presence, while others provide less frequent support, based on proximity to and capability of their ANDSF counterparts. Regional advisors are to track ANDSF capability development by assessing the progress of the ANA corps and ANP zone headquarters based on five capability pillars (see table 2). DOD and other Resolute Support advisors are to document the results of these assessments each quarter in an ANDSF Assessment Report. According to DOD reporting, in addition to ministerial and regional advising, two tactical-level advisory commands provide continuous support for the ANDSF’s specialized forces: Train, Advise, and Assist Command–Air (TAAC-Air) advises the Afghan Air Force down to the unit level, and NATO Special Operations Component Command–Afghanistan (NSOCC-A) primarily provides tactical-level special operations advising for the Afghan Special Security Forces. TAAC-Air and NSOCC-A assess capabilities at the headquarters level based on the five capability pillars described above in table 2, and these assessments are included in the quarterly ANDSF Assessment Report. Figure 2 shows the levels of advising each Resolute Support advisory command type provides for the ANDSF conventional forces and specialized forces. Since Resolute Support began, the ANDSF have improved some capabilities related to the functional areas and capability pillars described above, but face several capability gaps that leave them reliant on coalition assistance, according to publicly available DOD reporting. DOD defines capability as the ability to execute a given task. A capability gap is the inability to execute a specified course of action, such as an ANDSF functional area or a capability pillar (see tables 1 and 2 above). According to DOD guidance, a gap may occur because forces lack a materiel or non-materiel capability, lack proficiency or sufficiency in a capability, or need to replace an existing capability solution to prevent a future gap from occurring. According to DOD reporting on the Afghan security ministries, ANA corps, and ANP zones, the ANDSF generally have improved in some capability areas since Resolute Support began, with some components performing better than others. For example, DOD has reported that the Afghan ministries have improved in operational planning, strategic communications, and coordination between the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Defense at the national level. In general, the ANA is more capable than the ANP, according to DOD reporting. According to DOD officials and SIGAR reporting, this is due, in part, to the ANA having more coalition advisors and monitoring than the ANP. DOD officials also noted that the Ministry of Interior, which oversees the ANP, and Afghanistan’s justice system are both underdeveloped, hindering the effectiveness of the ANP. Corruption, understaffing, and training shortfalls have also contributed to the ANP’s underdevelopment, according to DOD and SIGAR reporting. The Afghan Special Security Forces are the most capable within the ANDSF and can conduct the majority of their operations independently without coalition enablers, according to DOD reporting. DOD and SIGAR reports have attributed the Afghan Special Security Forces’ relative proficiency to factors such as low attrition rates, longer training, and close partnership with coalition forces. The Afghan Air Force is becoming increasingly capable, and can independently plan for and perform some operational tasks, such as armed overwatch and aerial escort missions, according to DOD reporting. However, DOD has reported that the ANDSF generally continue to need support in several key areas. For example, as of December 2017, DOD reported several ministerial capability gaps, including force management; logistics; and analyzing and integrating intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance information. DOD also reported that, as of December 2017, the ANA and ANP continued to have capability gaps in several key areas, such as weapons and equipment sustainment and integrating fire from aerial and ground forces. The ANDSF rely on support from contractors and coalition forces to mitigate capability gaps in these key areas. For some capability areas, such as aircraft and vehicle maintenance and logistics, the ANDSF is not expected to be self- sufficient until at least 2023, according to DOD reporting. According to DOD officials and SIGAR reporting, coalition and contractor support helps mitigate ANDSF capability gaps in the immediate term but may make it challenging to assess the ANDSF’s capabilities and gaps independent of such support. For example, vehicle and aircraft maintenance contractors are responsible for sustaining specific operational readiness rates for the equipment they service. While this helps ensure that ANDSF personnel have working equipment to accomplish their mission, thereby closing an immediate capability gap, it may mask the ANDSF’s underlying capabilities and potentially prolong reliance on such support, according to DOD officials and SIGAR reporting. DOD and the ANDSF have begun implementing plans and initiatives that aim to strengthen ANDSF capabilities. These include the following, among others: ANDSF Roadmap. In 2017, the Afghan government began implementing the ANDSF Roadmap—a series of developmental initiatives that seek to strengthen the ANDSF and increase security and governance in Afghanistan, according to DOD reporting. The Roadmap is structured to span 4 years, but DOD has reported that its full implementation will likely take longer than that. According to DOD reporting, the Roadmap aims to improve four key elements: (1) fighting capabilities; (2) leadership development; (3) unity of command and effort; and (4) counter-corruption efforts. Under the Roadmap’s initiative to increase the ANDSF’s fighting capabilities, DOD and the ANDSF have begun implementing plans to increase the size of the specialized forces. Specifically, DOD reports that the ANDSF plans to nearly double the size of the Afghan Special Security Forces by 2020 as an effort to bolster the ANDSF’s offensive reach and effectiveness. The Afghan Special Security Forces are to become the ANDSF’s primary offensive force, the conventional ANA forces are to focus on consolidating gains and holding key terrain and infrastructure, and the conventional ANP forces are to focus on community policing efforts. In addition, to provide additional aerial fire and airlift capabilities, the ANDSF began implementing an aviation modernization plan in 2017. The aim is to increase personnel strength and the size of the Afghan Air Force and Special Mission Wing fleets by 2023. Enhanced vehicle maintenance efforts. To help improve the ANDSF’s vehicle maintenance abilities, DOD awarded a National Maintenance Strategy Ground Vehicle Support contract, which, according to DOD officials, became fully operational in December 2017. The National Maintenance Strategy Ground Vehicle Support contract consolidated five separate vehicle maintenance and training contracts into a single contract and contains provisions for building the capacity of ANDSF and Afghan contractors to incrementally take control of vehicle maintenance over a 5-year period. Additional U.S. military personnel. As part of the South Asia strategy, the United States committed 3,500 additional military personnel to increase support to its missions in Afghanistan. According to DOD reporting, most of the additional personnel will support the Resolute Support mission, providing more advising and combat enabler support to the ANDSF. Additionally, in March 2018, the United States began deploying a Security Force Assistance Brigade—a new type of unit made up of U.S. Army personnel with expertise in training foreign militaries—to Afghanistan. The Security Force Assistance Brigade will advise conventional and specialized forces at and below the corps and zone levels and will accompany and support ANA conventional forces at the battalion level in ground operations as needed, according to DOD and SIGAR reporting. DOD collects some reliable information about the operation and maintenance abilities of ANDSF specialized forces, in part because advisors are embedded at the tactical level with the specialized forces, according to DOD officials. Specifically, U.S. and coalition forces advise specialized forces at the tactical level under Resolute Support because building ANDSF aviation and special operations abilities are considered particularly important, according to DOD reporting. DOD officials told us that since U.S. and coalition forces are embedded at the tactical level for specialized forces, they can monitor, assess, and report on tactical abilities, including the ability to operate and maintain equipment. Our analysis of information provided by DOD about the Afghan Air Force’s ability to operate and maintain MD-530 helicopters illustrates that DOD has some detailed information about specialized forces. TAAC-Air advisors help train Afghan pilots and maintainers and collect information on their tactical abilities. For example, TAAC-Air advisors track the percentage of maintenance performed by Afghan Air Force maintainers and aircraft operational readiness rates, according to DOD officials. According to DOD reporting and officials, as of December 2017, the Afghan Air Force could independently conduct MD-530 helicopter operations for short intervals without contractor support but relied on contractors to perform the majority of maintenance and sustainment activities. See appendix II for more information on the Afghan Air Force’s ability to operate and maintain MD-530 helicopters. U.S. and coalition forces perform high-level assessments of the ANDSF conventional forces’ capabilities at the corps and zone levels but do not assess their tactical abilities, such as the ability to operate and maintain equipment, according to DOD officials. For example, U.S. and coalition forces assess the ANA and ANP conventional forces in quarterly ANDSF Assessment Reports, but these reports are at the corps and zone headquarters levels, and are not meant to provide an evaluation of the entire ANDSF, according to DOD reporting. DOD officials stated that other U.S.- and coalition-produced reports and assessments, such as DOD’s semiannual Section 1225 reports to Congress, semiannual periodic mission reviews, and annual Afghanistan Plans of Record, provide some information on the ANDSF’s high-level capabilities. However, according to DOD officials, these reports do not routinely assess the conventional forces’ ability to operate and maintain equipment. According to DOD officials, DOD does not assess conventional forces’ tactical abilities because advisors have had little or no direct contact with conventional units below the corps and zone levels, and thus do not collect such information on conventional forces. Specifically, under Resolute Support, U.S. and coalition forces have not embedded with the conventional forces below the corps and zone levels except in limited circumstances. Since U.S. and coalition forces do not collect firsthand information on the conventional units’ tactical abilities, they rely on those units’ self-reporting for information on ANDSF abilities below the corps and zone levels, which, according to DOD officials, may be unreliable. ANDSF reporting is not verified by U.S. officials and can be unreliable in its consistency, comprehensiveness, and credibility, according to DOD officials and SIGAR. For example, the ANDSF produce a monthly tracker on vehicle availability, maintenance backlog, repair times, and personnel productivity, but DOD officials told us that the trackers are of questionable accuracy. Our analysis of information provided by DOD about the ANDSF’s ability to operate and maintain tactical and nontactical radios illustrates the limited amount of information DOD has on ANDSF conventional forces’ tactical abilities. Specifically, DOD officials could not say how well ANDSF personnel on the front lines operate radios in the field and had only limited information on the ANDSF’s ability to maintain radios. For example, the officials noted that the ANA conventional forces can perform some unit-level radio repairs but that complex ANA radio maintenance and all ANP radio maintenance is conducted by contractors. DOD officials at Resolute Support headquarters told us that they provide ministerial- level advising on how to manage ANDSF radio systems and do not provide tactical advising or inventory control for radios. See appendix III for more information on the ANDSF’s ability to operate and maintain radios. Our analysis of information provided by DOD about the ANDSF’s ability to operate and maintain Mobile Strike Force Vehicles (MSFV) highlights the limited amount of information DOD has on ANDSF conventional forces’ tactical abilities compared with specialized forces. DOD officials were able to provide operation and maintenance information for MSFVs that had transferred to the specialized forces as of January 2018 but were unable to provide operation and maintenance information for any other MSFVs. The ANDSF began transferring one of the ANDSF’s two MSFV brigades from the conventional to specialized forces in August 2017, according to DOD officials. As part of this transfer, NSOCC-A advisors—who provide tactical-level advising for the Afghan Special Security Forces—assumed oversight for the first brigade from Resolute Support headquarters advisors. DOD officials stated that the ANDSF’s ability to operate and maintain MSFVs in this brigade prior to the transfer was unknown, as neither Resolute Support headquarters nor the ANA had assessed this. The operation and maintenance abilities of the second brigade, which is still in the conventional forces, remains unknown. DOD officials at NSOCC-A were able to provide information such as inventory and mission capability rates for the MSFVs that had transferred, but only for the short period of time the vehicles had been under the control of the specialized forces. DOD officials told us that NSOCC-A plans to collect more information on the specialized forces’ ability to operate and maintain MSFVs as they are transferred. See appendix IV for more information on the ANDSF’s ability to operate and maintain MSFVs. In the absence of embedded advisors at the tactical level, DOD has not implemented alternative approaches to collect reliable information about the conventional forces’ ability to operate and maintain equipment. Federal internal control standards state that U.S. agencies should obtain and process reliable information to evaluate performance in achieving key objectives and assessing risks. DOD officials acknowledged that some of the plans described above that DOD and the ANDSF have begun implementing to address capability gaps may provide opportunities for DOD to collect more reliable information on the conventional forces’ ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment. For example, the National Maintenance Strategy Ground Vehicle Support contract requires that contractors regularly report the total work orders received, work in progress, and completed maintenance work performed by ANDSF personnel as well as vehicle availability rates, which may be more reliable than the ANDSF’s monthly report on vehicle availability. In addition, the Security Force Assistance Brigade may be able to collect and report on the tactical abilities of units they advise and accompany on missions since they are being deployed at or below the corps and zone levels. However, as of June 2018, DOD officials had not decided which, if any, of these options to pursue. Without reliable information on the equipment operation and maintenance abilities of ANDSF conventional forces, which represent nearly 75 percent of the ANDSF, DOD may be unable to fully evaluate the success of its train, advise, assist, and equip efforts in Afghanistan. The United States invested nearly $84 billion in Afghan security in the 17- year period spanning fiscal years 2002 through 2018, but DOD continues to face challenges to developing a self-sustaining ANDSF. While DOD has reported the ANDSF have improved in several capability areas, they continue to face critical capability gaps, impeding their ability to maintain security and stability in Afghanistan independent of U.S. and coalition forces. Moreover, DOD lacks reliable information about the degree to which conventional forces—which make up about three-quarters of the ANDSF—are able to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment. This limits DOD’s ability to fully evaluate the success of its train, advise, assist, and equip efforts in Afghanistan. The Secretary of Defense should develop and, as appropriate, implement options for collecting reliable information on the ANDSF conventional forces’ ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment. (Recommendation 1) We provided a draft of this report to DOD and State for comment. DOD declined to provide written comments specifically on this public version of the report, but DOD’s comments on the sensitive version of this report are reprinted in appendix V. The sensitive version of this report included two recommendations, which DOD cited in its comments on the draft of the sensitive report. One of those recommendations related to information that DOD deemed to be sensitive and that must be protected from public disclosure. Therefore, we have omitted that recommendation from DOD’s comment letter in appendix V. This omission did not have a material effect on the substance of DOD’s comments. In its comments, DOD concurred with the recommendation we made in this version of the report and stated it will take steps to implement it. DOD also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. The Department of State had no comments. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of State. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff has any questions about this report please contact me at (202) 512-7114 or farbj@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix VI. House Report 114-537 associated with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for us to review the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces’ (ANDSF) capability and capacity to operate and sustain U.S.-purchased weapon systems and equipment. This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on September 20, 2018. Our September report included three objectives, including one on the extent to which DOD considers ANDSF input and meets their needs when identifying equipment requirements. DOD deemed the information related to that objective to be sensitive, which must be protected from public disclosure. Consequently, we removed that objective and a related recommendation from this public report. This version includes information on the other two objectives: (1) what has been reported about ANDSF capabilities and capability gaps and (2) the extent to which DOD has information about the ANDSF’s ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment. Although the information provided in this report is more limited, the report uses the same methodology for the two objectives as the sensitive report. To identify what has been reported about ANDSF capabilities and capability gaps, we reviewed North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and DOD documents and reports, such as DOD’s semiannual Section 1225 reports to Congress, produced after the start of the NATO-led Resolute Support mission on January 1, 2015. To determine what steps DOD and NATO have taken to try to address gaps, we reviewed reports the Center for Naval Analyses produced for DOD, as well as DOD and NATO documents and reports produced after January 1, 2015, and reports from GAO, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), and the DOD Inspector General. We also interviewed Center for Naval Analyses representatives and DOD officials in the United States and Afghanistan, including DOD officials at the Combined Security Transition Command–Afghanistan (CSTC-A) and in the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy (OSD-P) who helped create the DOD reporting we reviewed. To determine the extent to which DOD has information about the ANDSF’s ability to operate and maintain U.S.-purchased equipment, we reviewed DOD documents and reports and interviewed DOD officials in the United States and Afghanistan, including DOD officials who advise the ANDSF. We also reviewed federal internal control standards to determine what responsibilities agencies have specifically related to information collection. To provide illustrative examples of information DOD has about the ANDSF’s ability to operate and maintain U.S.- purchased equipment and what that information indicates about the ANDSF’s abilities and challenges, we interviewed and analyzed written responses from DOD officials, including DOD officials who provide procurement and lifecycle management for some ANDSF aircraft and vehicles, about three equipment types—MD-530 helicopters, Mobile Strike Force Vehicles (MSFV), and radios. We selected these three equipment types from a list that we developed, for an August 2017 report, of key ANDSF equipment the United States purchased from fiscal years 2003 through 2016. We made our selections after reviewing DOD documentation and interviewing DOD officials regarding a number of considerations, such as (1) how critical the equipment is to the ANDSF’s ability to achieve its mission; (2) which ANDSF component uses the equipment (i.e., Afghan National Police, Afghan National Army, or both); (3) whether DOD intends to continue procuring the equipment for the ANDSF; and (4) whether the equipment had been in use at least 5 years. We collected detailed information about the ANDSF’s ability to operate and maintain MD-530 helicopters, MSFVs, and radios, as well as other key statistics DOD provided about the equipment, such as inventory, average lifespan, average cost, role, and training. This information was based mainly on DOD responses collected from January 2018 to February 2018 as well as DOD documents and reports produced after January 1, 2015. The total amount of MD-530s and radios authorized for procurement was based on DOD data that we collected for our August 2017 report on key ANDSF equipment the United States purchased in fiscal years 2003 through 2016, which we supplemented with additional data DOD provided on U.S.-purchased equipment from October 1, 2016, through December, 31, 2017. The performance audit upon which this report is based was conducted from August 2016 to September 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate, evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We subsequently worked with DOD from September 2018 to October 2018 to prepare this public version of the original sensitive report for public release. This public version was also prepared in accordance with those standards. Manufacturer: MD Helicopters, Inc. U.S. Program Management Office: U.S. Army, Non-Standard Rotary Wing Aircraft Project Management Office Program Advising: Train Advise Assist Command–Air (TAAC-Air) The United States originally procured 6 unarmed MD-530s for the AAF for rotary wing training in 2011. In 2014, the United States purchased 12 armed MD-530s and began retrofitting the 5 remaining trainer helicopters with armament for operational missions to address a close air attack gap. MD- 530s were chosen to fill the gap over other aircraft, in part because they could be delivered relatively quickly as the AAF awaited A-29 light attack aircraft that were experiencing procurement delays, according to Department of Defense (DOD) officials. The United States procured additional MD-530s in 2015, 2016, and 2017 because of the aircraft’s positive impact on the battlefield, according to DOD officials (see fig. 3). Key Statistics Variants: All can be armed with .50-cal machine gun pods and/or 2.75 inch rocket pods. Total Authorized for Procurement: 60 as of December 31, 2017 Inventory: 25 as of January 2018 (30 are scheduled for delivery; attrition of 5 due to crashes and enemy fire) Average Lifespan: Absent mishaps, and with good maintenance, there is no defined lifespan limit for MD-530s, according to DOD officials. National Army and Afghan National Police, depending on the mission, in all but one region of Afghanistan, which is supported by other aircraft. MD-530s are typically tasked two at a time for missions, according to DOD officials. An MD-530 crew consists of a pilot and co-pilot, according to DOD. Average cost: $6.3 million per aircraft, including all electronic devices, weapons management systems, and weapons (excluding ordnance), according to DOD officials. o Division of labor is based on the individual crew members' capabilities, with one pilot handling navigation and communication while the other identifies targets and operates the weapon systems. Army pilot advisors at Kandahar Air Field, according to DOD officials. o MD-530 pilot training takes about 3 years (see fig. 4). 1. The GAO report number cited in DOD’s letter refers to a draft of the sensitive version of this report, which we issued on September 20, 2018. Prior to issuing that version, we changed its report number to GAO-18- 662SU to reflect its sensitive nature. That version of this report included two recommendations. The second recommendation has been omitted from DOD’s letter in this public version because it was related to information that DOD deemed to be sensitive. In addition to the contact named above, Joyee Dasgupta (Assistant Director), Kara Marshall, Katherine Forsyth, and Bridgette Savino made key contributions to this report. The team also benefitted from the expert advice and assistance of David Dayton, Neil Doherty, Justin Fisher, Ashley Alley, Cary Russell, Marie Mak, James Reynolds, Sally Williamson, Ji Byun, and J.

Do not provide any explanation.\n\nStory: This etext was prepared by Sue Asscher <asschers@aia.net.au>\n\n\n\n\n\nCRITO\n\nby Plato\n\n\n\n\nTranslated by Benjamin Jowett\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nThe Crito seems intended to exhibit the character of Socrates in one light\nonly, not as the philosopher, fulfilling a divine mission and trusting in\nthe will of heaven, but simply as the good citizen, who having been\nunjustly condemned is willing to give up his life in obedience to the laws\nof the state...\n\nThe days of Socrates are drawing to a close; the fatal ship has been seen\noff Sunium, as he is informed by his aged friend and contemporary Crito,\nwho visits him before the dawn has broken; he himself has been warned in a\ndream that on the third day he must depart.  Time is precious, and Crito\nhas come early in order to gain his consent to a plan of escape.  This can\nbe easily accomplished by his friends, who will incur no danger in making\nthe attempt to save him, but will be disgraced for ever if they allow him\nto perish.  He should think of his duty to his children, and not play into\nthe hands of his enemies.  Money is already provided by Crito as well as by\nSimmias and others, and he will have no difficulty in finding friends in\nThessaly and other places.\n\nSocrates is afraid that Crito is but pressing upon him the opinions of the\nmany:  whereas, all his life long he has followed the dictates of reason\nonly and the opinion of the one wise or skilled man.  There was a time when\nCrito himself had allowed the propriety of this.  And although some one\nwill say 'the many can kill us,' that makes no difference; but a good life,\nin other words, a just and honourable life, is alone to be valued.  All\nconsiderations of loss of reputation or injury to his children should be\ndismissed:  the only question is whether he would be right in attempting to\nescape.  Crito, who is a disinterested person not having the fear of death\nbefore his eyes, shall answer this for him.  Before he was condemned they\nhad often held discussions, in which they agreed that no man should either\ndo evil, or return evil for evil, or betray the right.  Are these\nprinciples to be altered because the circumstances of Socrates are altered?\nCrito admits that they remain the same.  Then is his escape consistent with\nthe maintenance of them?  To this Crito is unable or unwilling to reply.\n\nSocrates proceeds:--Suppose the Laws of Athens to come and remonstrate with\nhim:  they will ask 'Why does he seek to overturn them?' and if he replies,\n'they have injured him,' will not the Laws answer, 'Yes, but was that the\nagreement?  Has he any objection to make to them which would justify him in\noverturning them?  Was he not brought into the world and educated by their\nhelp, and are they not his parents?  He might have left Athens and gone\nwhere he pleased, but he has lived there for seventy years more constantly\nthan any other citizen.'  Thus he has clearly shown that he acknowledged\nthe agreement, which he cannot now break without dishonour to himself and\ndanger to his friends.  Even in the course of the trial he might have\nproposed exile as the penalty, but then he declared that he preferred death\nto exile.  And whither will he direct his footsteps?  In any well-ordered\nstate the Laws will consider him as an enemy.  Possibly in a land of\nmisrule like Thessaly he may be welcomed at first, and the unseemly\nnarrative of his escape will be regarded by the inhabitants as an amusing\ntale.  But if he offends them he will have to learn another sort of lesson.\nWill he continue to give lectures in virtue?  That would hardly be decent.\nAnd how will his children be the gainers if he takes them into Thessaly,\nand deprives them of Athenian citizenship?  Or if he leaves them behind,\ndoes he expect that they will be better taken care of by his friends\nbecause he is in Thessaly?  Will not true friends care for them equally\nwhether he is alive or dead?\n\nFinally, they exhort him to think of justice first, and of life and\nchildren afterwards.  He may now depart in peace and innocence, a sufferer\nand not a doer of evil.  But if he breaks agreements, and returns evil for\nevil, they will be angry with him while he lives; and their brethren the\nLaws of the world below will receive him as an enemy.  Such is the mystic\nvoice which is always murmuring in his ears.\n\nThat Socrates was not a good citizen was a charge made against him during\nhis lifetime, which has been often repeated in later ages.  The crimes of\nAlcibiades, Critias, and Charmides, who had been his pupils, were still\nrecent in the memory of the now restored democracy.  The fact that he had\nbeen neutral in the death-struggle of Athens was not likely to conciliate\npopular good-will.  Plato, writing probably in the next generation,\nundertakes the defence of his friend and master in this particular, not to\nthe Athenians of his day, but to posterity and the world at large.\n\nWhether such an incident ever really occurred as the visit of Crito and the\nproposal of escape is uncertain:  Plato could easily have invented far more\nthan that (Phaedr.); and in the selection of Crito, the aged friend, as the\nfittest person to make the proposal to Socrates, we seem to recognize the\nhand of the artist.  Whether any one who has been subjected by the laws of\nhis country to an unjust judgment is right in attempting to escape, is a\nthesis about which casuists might disagree.  Shelley (Prose Works) is of\nopinion that Socrates 'did well to die,' but not for the 'sophistical'\nreasons which Plato has put into his mouth.  And there would be no\ndifficulty in arguing that Socrates should have lived and preferred to a\nglorious death the good which he might still be able to perform.  'A\nrhetorician would have had much to say upon that point.'  It may be\nobserved however that Plato never intended to answer the question of\ncasuistry, but only to exhibit the ideal of patient virtue which refuses to\ndo the least evil in order to avoid the greatest, and to show his master\nmaintaining in death the opinions which he had professed in his life.  Not\n'the world,' but the 'one wise man,' is still the paradox of Socrates in\nhis last hours.  He must be guided by reason, although her conclusions may\nbe fatal to him.  The remarkable sentiment that the wicked can do neither\ngood nor evil is true, if taken in the sense, which he means, of moral\nevil; in his own words, 'they cannot make a man wise or foolish.'\n\nThis little dialogue is a perfect piece of dialectic, in which granting the\n'common principle,' there is no escaping from the conclusion.  It is\nanticipated at the beginning by the dream of Socrates and the parody of\nHomer.  The personification of the Laws, and of their brethren the Laws in\nthe world below, is one of the noblest and boldest figures of speech which\noccur in Plato.\n\n\nCRITO\n\nby\n\nPlato\n\nTranslated by Benjamin Jowett\n\n\nPERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:  Socrates, Crito.\n\nSCENE:  The Prison of Socrates.\n\n\nSOCRATES:  Why have you come at this hour, Crito? it must be quite early.\n\nCRITO:  Yes, certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  What is the exact time?\n\nCRITO:  The dawn is breaking.\n\nSOCRATES:  I wonder that the keeper of the prison would let you in.\n\nCRITO:  He knows me because I often come, Socrates; moreover.  I have done\nhim a kindness.\n\nSOCRATES:  And are you only just arrived?\n\nCRITO:  No, I came some time ago.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then why did you sit and say nothing, instead of at once\nawakening me?\n\nCRITO:  I should not have liked myself, Socrates, to be in such great\ntrouble and unrest as you are--indeed I should not:  I have been watching\nwith amazement your peaceful slumbers; and for that reason I did not awake\nyou, because I wished to minimize the pain.  I have always thought you to\nbe of a happy disposition; but never did I see anything like the easy,\ntranquil manner in which you bear this calamity.\n\nSOCRATES:  Why, Crito, when a man has reached my age he ought not to be\nrepining at the approach of death.\n\nCRITO:  And yet other old men find themselves in similar misfortunes, and\nage does not prevent them from repining.\n\nSOCRATES:  That is true.  But you have not told me why you come at this\nearly hour.\n\nCRITO:  I come to bring you a message which is sad and painful; not, as I\nbelieve, to yourself, but to all of us who are your friends, and saddest of\nall to me.\n\nSOCRATES:  What?  Has the ship come from Delos, on the arrival of which I\nam to die?\n\nCRITO:  No, the ship has not actually arrived, but she will probably be\nhere to-day, as persons who have come from Sunium tell me that they have\nleft her there; and therefore to-morrow, Socrates, will be the last day of\nyour life.\n\nSOCRATES:  Very well, Crito; if such is the will of God, I am willing; but\nmy belief is that there will be a delay of a day.\n\nCRITO:  Why do you think so?\n\nSOCRATES:  I will tell you.  I am to die on the day after the arrival of\nthe ship?\n\nCRITO:  Yes; that is what the authorities say.\n\nSOCRATES:  But I do not think that the ship will be here until to-morrow;\nthis I infer from a vision which I had last night, or rather only just now,\nwhen you fortunately allowed me to sleep.\n\nCRITO:  And what was the nature of the vision?\n\nSOCRATES:  There appeared to me the likeness of a woman, fair and comely,\nclothed in bright raiment, who called to me and said:  O Socrates,\n\n'The third day hence to fertile Phthia shalt thou go.'  (Homer, Il.)\n\nCRITO:  What a singular dream, Socrates!\n\nSOCRATES:  There can be no doubt about the meaning, Crito, I think.\n\nCRITO:  Yes; the meaning is only too clear.  But, oh! my beloved Socrates,\nlet me entreat you once more to take my advice and escape.  For if you die\nI shall not only lose a friend who can never be replaced, but there is\nanother evil:  people who do not know you and me will believe that I might\nhave saved you if I had been willing to give money, but that I did not\ncare.  Now, can there be a worse disgrace than this--that I should be\nthought to value money more than the life of a friend?  For the many will\nnot be persuaded that I wanted you to escape, and that you refused.\n\nSOCRATES:  But why, my dear Crito, should we care about the opinion of the\nmany?  Good men, and they are the only persons who are worth considering,\nwill think of these things truly as they occurred.\n\nCRITO:  But you see, Socrates, that the opinion of the many must be\nregarded, for what is now happening shows that they can do the greatest\nevil to any one who has lost their good opinion.\n\nSOCRATES:  I only wish it were so, Crito; and that the many could do the\ngreatest evil; for then they would also be able to do the greatest good--\nand what a fine thing this would be!  But in reality they can do neither;\nfor they cannot make a man either wise or foolish; and whatever they do is\nthe result of chance.\n\nCRITO:  Well, I will not dispute with you; but please to tell me, Socrates,\nwhether you are not acting out of regard to me and your other friends:  are\nyou not afraid that if you escape from prison we may get into trouble with\nthe informers for having stolen you away, and lose either the whole or a\ngreat part of our property; or that even a worse evil may happen to us?\nNow, if you fear on our account, be at ease; for in order to save you, we\nought surely to run this, or even a greater risk; be persuaded, then, and\ndo as I say.\n\nSOCRATES:  Yes, Crito, that is one fear which you mention, but by no means\nthe only one.\n\nCRITO:  Fear not--there are persons who are willing to get you out of\nprison at no great cost; and as for the informers they are far from being\nexorbitant in their demands--a little money will satisfy them.  My means,\nwhich are certainly ample, are at your service, and if you have a scruple\nabout spending all mine, here are strangers who will give you the use of\ntheirs; and one of them, Simmias the Theban, has brought a large sum of\nmoney for this very purpose; and Cebes and many others are prepared to\nspend their money in helping you to escape.  I say, therefore, do not\nhesitate on our account, and do not say, as you did in the court (compare\nApol.), that you will have a difficulty in knowing what to do with yourself\nanywhere else.  For men will love you in other places to which you may go,\nand not in Athens only; there are friends of mine in Thessaly, if you like\nto go to them, who will value and protect you, and no Thessalian will give\nyou any trouble.  Nor can I think that you are at all justified, Socrates,\nin betraying your own life when you might be saved; in acting thus you are\nplaying into the hands of your enemies, who are hurrying on your\ndestruction.  And further I should say that you are deserting your own\nchildren; for you might bring them up and educate them; instead of which\nyou go away and leave them, and they will have to take their chance; and if\nthey do not meet with the usual fate of orphans, there will be small thanks\nto you.  No man should bring children into the world who is unwilling to\npersevere to the end in their nurture and education.  But you appear to be\nchoosing the easier part, not the better and manlier, which would have been\nmore becoming in one who professes to care for virtue in all his actions,\nlike yourself.  And indeed, I am ashamed not only of you, but of us who are\nyour friends, when I reflect that the whole business will be attributed\nentirely to our want of courage.  The trial need never have come on, or\nmight have been managed differently; and this last act, or crowning folly,\nwill seem to have occurred through our negligence and cowardice, who might\nhave saved you, if we had been good for anything; and you might have saved\nyourself, for there was no difficulty at all.  See now, Socrates, how sad\nand discreditable are the consequences, both to us and you.  Make up your\nmind then, or rather have your mind already made up, for the time of\ndeliberation is over, and there is only one thing to be done, which must be\ndone this very night, and if we delay at all will be no longer practicable\nor possible; I beseech you therefore, Socrates, be persuaded by me, and do\nas I say.\n\nSOCRATES:  Dear Crito, your zeal is invaluable, if a right one; but if\nwrong, the greater the zeal the greater the danger; and therefore we ought\nto consider whether I shall or shall not do as you say.  For I am and\nalways have been one of those natures who must be guided by reason,\nwhatever the reason may be which upon reflection appears to me to be the\nbest; and now that this chance has befallen me, I cannot repudiate my own\nwords:  the principles which I have hitherto honoured and revered I still\nhonour, and unless we can at once find other and better principles, I am\ncertain not to agree with you; no, not even if the power of the multitude\ncould inflict many more imprisonments, confiscations, deaths, frightening\nus like children with hobgoblin terrors (compare Apol.).  What will be the\nfairest way of considering the question?  Shall I return to your old\nargument about the opinions of men?--we were saying that some of them are\nto be regarded, and others not.  Now were we right in maintaining this\nbefore I was condemned?  And has the argument which was once good now\nproved to be talk for the sake of talking--mere childish nonsense?  That is\nwhat I want to consider with your help, Crito:--whether, under my present\ncircumstances, the argument appears to be in any way different or not; and\nis to be allowed by me or disallowed.  That argument, which, as I believe,\nis maintained by many persons of authority, was to the effect, as I was\nsaying, that the opinions of some men are to be regarded, and of other men\nnot to be regarded.  Now you, Crito, are not going to die to-morrow--at\nleast, there is no human probability of this, and therefore you are\ndisinterested and not liable to be deceived by the circumstances in which\nyou are placed.  Tell me then, whether I am right in saying that some\nopinions, and the opinions of some men only, are to be valued, and that\nother opinions, and the opinions of other men, are not to be valued.  I ask\nyou whether I was right in maintaining this?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  The good are to be regarded, and not the bad?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  And the opinions of the wise are good, and the opinions of the\nunwise are evil?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what was said about another matter?  Is the pupil who\ndevotes himself to the practice of gymnastics supposed to attend to the\npraise and blame and opinion of every man, or of one man only--his\nphysician or trainer, whoever he may be?\n\nCRITO:  Of one man only.\n\nSOCRATES:  And he ought to fear the censure and welcome the praise of that\none only, and not of the many?\n\nCRITO:  Clearly so.\n\nSOCRATES:  And he ought to act and train, and eat and drink in the way\nwhich seems good to his single master who has understanding, rather than\naccording to the opinion of all other men put together?\n\nCRITO:  True.\n\nSOCRATES:  And if he disobeys and disregards the opinion and approval of\nthe one, and regards the opinion of the many who have no understanding,\nwill he not suffer evil?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly he will.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what will the evil be, whither tending and what affecting,\nin the disobedient person?\n\nCRITO:  Clearly, affecting the body; that is what is destroyed by the evil.\n\nSOCRATES:  Very good; and is not this true, Crito, of other things which we\nneed not separately enumerate?  In questions of just and unjust, fair and\nfoul, good and evil, which are the subjects of our present consultation,\nought we to follow the opinion of the many and to fear them; or the opinion\nof the one man who has understanding? ought we not to fear and reverence\nhim more than all the rest of the world:  and if we desert him shall we not\ndestroy and injure that principle in us which may be assumed to be improved\nby justice and deteriorated by injustice;--there is such a principle?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly there is, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Take a parallel instance:--if, acting under the advice of those\nwho have no understanding, we destroy that which is improved by health and\nis deteriorated by disease, would life be worth having?  And that which has\nbeen destroyed is--the body?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  Could we live, having an evil and corrupted body?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  And will life be worth having, if that higher part of man be\ndestroyed, which is improved by justice and depraved by injustice?  Do we\nsuppose that principle, whatever it may be in man, which has to do with\njustice and injustice, to be inferior to the body?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  More honourable than the body?\n\nCRITO:  Far more.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then, my friend, we must not regard what the many say of us:\nbut what he, the one man who has understanding of just and unjust, will\nsay, and what the truth will say.  And therefore you begin in error when\nyou advise that we should regard the opinion of the many about just and\nunjust, good and evil, honorable and dishonorable.--'Well,' some one will\nsay, 'but the many can kill us.'\n\nCRITO:  Yes, Socrates; that will clearly be the answer.\n\nSOCRATES:  And it is true; but still I find with surprise that the old\nargument is unshaken as ever.  And I should like to know whether I may say\nthe same of another proposition--that not life, but a good life, is to be\nchiefly valued?\n\nCRITO:  Yes, that also remains unshaken.\n\nSOCRATES:  And a good life is equivalent to a just and honorable one--that\nholds also?\n\nCRITO:  Yes, it does.\n\nSOCRATES:  From these premisses I proceed to argue the question whether I\nought or ought not to try and escape without the consent of the Athenians:\nand if I am clearly right in escaping, then I will make the attempt; but if\nnot, I will abstain.  The other considerations which you mention, of money\nand loss of character and the duty of educating one's children, are, I\nfear, only the doctrines of the multitude, who would be as ready to restore\npeople to life, if they were able, as they are to put them to death--and\nwith as little reason.  But now, since the argument has thus far prevailed,\nthe only question which remains to be considered is, whether we shall do\nrightly either in escaping or in suffering others to aid in our escape and\npaying them in money and thanks, or whether in reality we shall not do\nrightly; and if the latter, then death or any other calamity which may\nensue on my remaining here must not be allowed to enter into the\ncalculation.\n\nCRITO:  I think that you are right, Socrates; how then shall we proceed?\n\nSOCRATES:  Let us consider the matter together, and do you either refute me\nif you can, and I will be convinced; or else cease, my dear friend, from\nrepeating to me that I ought to escape against the wishes of the Athenians:\nfor I highly value your attempts to persuade me to do so, but I may not be\npersuaded against my own better judgment.  And now please to consider my\nfirst position, and try how you can best answer me.\n\nCRITO:  I will.\n\nSOCRATES:  Are we to say that we are never intentionally to do wrong, or\nthat in one way we ought and in another way we ought not to do wrong, or is\ndoing wrong always evil and dishonorable, as I was just now saying, and as\nhas been already acknowledged by us?  Are all our former admissions which\nwere made within a few days to be thrown away?  And have we, at our age,\nbeen earnestly discoursing with one another all our life long only to\ndiscover that we are no better than children?  Or, in spite of the opinion\nof the many, and in spite of consequences whether better or worse, shall we\ninsist on the truth of what was then said, that injustice is always an evil\nand dishonour to him who acts unjustly?  Shall we say so or not?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then we must do no wrong?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  Nor when injured injure in return, as the many imagine; for we\nmust injure no one at all?  (E.g. compare Rep.)\n\nCRITO:  Clearly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  Again, Crito, may we do evil?\n\nCRITO:  Surely not, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what of doing evil in return for evil, which is the morality\nof the many--is that just or not?\n\nCRITO:  Not just.\n\nSOCRATES:  For doing evil to another is the same as injuring him?\n\nCRITO:  Very true.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then we ought not to retaliate or render evil for evil to any\none, whatever evil we may have suffered from him.  But I would have you\nconsider, Crito, whether you really mean what you are saying.  For this\nopinion has never been held, and never will be held, by any considerable\nnumber of persons; and those who are agreed and those who are not agreed\nupon this point have no common ground, and can only despise one another\nwhen they see how widely they differ.  Tell me, then, whether you agree\nwith and assent to my first principle, that neither injury nor retaliation\nnor warding off evil by evil is ever right.  And shall that be the premiss\nof our argument?  Or do you decline and dissent from this?  For so I have\never thought, and continue to think; but, if you are of another opinion,\nlet me hear what you have to say.  If, however, you remain of the same mind\nas formerly, I will proceed to the next step.\n\nCRITO:  You may proceed, for I have not changed my mind.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then I will go on to the next point, which may be put in the\nform of a question:--Ought a man to do what he admits to be right, or ought\nhe to betray the right?\n\nCRITO:  He ought to do what he thinks right.\n\nSOCRATES:  But if this is true, what is the application?  In leaving the\nprison against the will of the Athenians, do I wrong any? or rather do I\nnot wrong those whom I ought least to wrong?  Do I not desert the\nprinciples which were acknowledged by us to be just--what do you say?\n\nCRITO:  I cannot tell, Socrates, for I do not know.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then consider the matter in this way:--Imagine that I am about\nto play truant (you may call the proceeding by any name which you like),\nand the laws and the government come and interrogate me:  'Tell us,\nSocrates,' they say; 'what are you about? are you not going by an act of\nyours to overturn us--the laws, and the whole state, as far as in you lies?\nDo you imagine that a state can subsist and not be overthrown, in which the\ndecisions of law have no power, but are set aside and trampled upon by\nindividuals?'  What will be our answer, Crito, to these and the like words?\nAny one, and especially a rhetorician, will have a good deal to say on\nbehalf of the law which requires a sentence to be carried out.  He will\nargue that this law should not be set aside; and shall we reply, 'Yes; but\nthe state has injured us and given an unjust sentence.'  Suppose I say\nthat?\n\nCRITO:  Very good, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  'And was that our agreement with you?' the law would answer; 'or\nwere you to abide by the sentence of the state?'  And if I were to express\nmy astonishment at their words, the law would probably add:  'Answer,\nSocrates, instead of opening your eyes--you are in the habit of asking and\nanswering questions.  Tell us,--What complaint have you to make against us\nwhich justifies you in attempting to destroy us and the state?  In the\nfirst place did we not bring you into existence?  Your father married your\nmother by our aid and begat you.  Say whether you have any objection to\nurge against those of us who regulate marriage?'  None, I should reply.\n'Or against those of us who after birth regulate the nurture and education\nof children, in which you also were trained?  Were not the laws, which have\nthe charge of education, right in commanding your father to train you in\nmusic and gymnastic?'  Right, I should reply.  'Well then, since you were\nbrought into the world and nurtured and educated by us, can you deny in the\nfirst place that you are our child and slave, as your fathers were before\nyou?  And if this is true you are not on equal terms with us; nor can you\nthink that you have a right to do to us what we are doing to you.  Would\nyou have any right to strike or revile or do any other evil to your father\nor your master, if you had one, because you have been struck or reviled by\nhim, or received some other evil at his hands?--you would not say this?\nAnd because we think right to destroy you, do you think that you have any\nright to destroy us in return, and your country as far as in you lies?\nWill you, O professor of true virtue, pretend that you are justified in\nthis?  Has a philosopher like you failed to discover that our country is\nmore to be valued and higher and holier far than mother or father or any\nancestor, and more to be regarded in the eyes of the gods and of men of\nunderstanding? also to be soothed, and gently and reverently entreated when\nangry, even more than a father, and either to be persuaded, or if not\npersuaded, to be obeyed?  And when we are punished by her, whether with\nimprisonment or stripes, the punishment is to be endured in silence; and if\nshe lead us to wounds or death in battle, thither we follow as is right;\nneither may any one yield or retreat or leave his rank, but whether in\nbattle or in a court of law, or in any other place, he must do what his\ncity and his country order him; or he must change their view of what is\njust:  and if he may do no violence to his father or mother, much less may\nhe do violence to his country.'  What answer shall we make to this, Crito?\nDo the laws speak truly, or do they not?\n\nCRITO:  I think that they do.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then the laws will say:  'Consider, Socrates, if we are speaking\ntruly that in your present attempt you are going to do us an injury.  For,\nhaving brought you into the world, and nurtured and educated you, and given\nyou and every other citizen a share in every good which we had to give, we\nfurther proclaim to any Athenian by the liberty which we allow him, that if\nhe does not like us when he has become of age and has seen the ways of the\ncity, and made our acquaintance, he may go where he pleases and take his\ngoods with him.  None of us laws will forbid him or interfere with him.\nAny one who does not like us and the city, and who wants to emigrate to a\ncolony or to any other city, may go where he likes, retaining his property.\nBut he who has experience of the manner in which we order justice and\nadminister the state, and still remains, has entered into an implied\ncontract that he will do as we command him.  And he who disobeys us is, as\nwe maintain, thrice wrong:  first, because in disobeying us he is\ndisobeying his parents; secondly, because we are the authors of his\neducation; thirdly, because he has made an agreement with us that he will\nduly obey our commands; and he neither obeys them nor convinces us that our\ncommands are unjust; and we do not rudely impose them, but give him the\nalternative of obeying or convincing us;--that is what we offer, and he\ndoes neither.\n\n'These are the sort of accusations to which, as we were saying, you,\nSocrates, will be exposed if you accomplish your intentions; you, above all\nother Athenians.'  Suppose now I ask, why I rather than anybody else? they\nwill justly retort upon me that I above all other men have acknowledged the\nagreement.  'There is clear proof,' they will say, 'Socrates, that we and\nthe city were not displeasing to you.  Of all Athenians you have been the\nmost constant resident in the city, which, as you never leave, you may be\nsupposed to love (compare Phaedr.).  For you never went out of the city\neither to see the games, except once when you went to the Isthmus, or to\nany other place unless when you were on military service; nor did you\ntravel as other men do.  Nor had you any curiosity to know other states or\ntheir laws:  your affections did not go beyond us and our state; we were\nyour especial favourites, and you acquiesced in our government of you; and\nhere in this city you begat your children, which is a proof of your\nsatisfaction.  Moreover, you might in the course of the trial, if you had\nliked, have fixed the penalty at banishment; the state which refuses to let\nyou go now would have let you go then.  But you pretended that you\npreferred death to exile (compare Apol.), and that you were not unwilling\nto die.  And now you have forgotten these fine sentiments, and pay no\nrespect to us the laws, of whom you are the destroyer; and are doing what\nonly a miserable slave would do, running away and turning your back upon\nthe compacts and agreements which you made as a citizen.  And first of all\nanswer this very question:  Are we right in saying that you agreed to be\ngoverned according to us in deed, and not in word only?  Is that true or\nnot?'  How shall we answer, Crito?  Must we not assent?\n\nCRITO:  We cannot help it, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then will they not say:  'You, Socrates, are breaking the\ncovenants and agreements which you made with us at your leisure, not in any\nhaste or under any compulsion or deception, but after you have had seventy\nyears to think of them, during which time you were at liberty to leave the\ncity, if we were not to your mind, or if our covenants appeared to you to\nbe unfair.  You had your choice, and might have gone either to Lacedaemon\nor Crete, both which states are often praised by you for their good\ngovernment, or to some other Hellenic or foreign state.  Whereas you, above\nall other Athenians, seemed to be so fond of the state, or, in other words,\nof us her laws (and who would care about a state which has no laws?), that\nyou never stirred out of her; the halt, the blind, the maimed, were not\nmore stationary in her than you were.  And now you run away and forsake\nyour agreements.  Not so, Socrates, if you will take our advice; do not\nmake yourself ridiculous by escaping out of the city.\n\n'For just consider, if you transgress and err in this sort of way, what\ngood will you do either to yourself or to your friends?  That your friends\nwill be driven into exile and deprived of citizenship, or will lose their\nproperty, is tolerably certain; and you yourself, if you fly to one of the\nneighbouring cities, as, for example, Thebes or Megara, both of which are\nwell governed, will come to them as an enemy, Socrates, and their\ngovernment will be against you, and all patriotic citizens will cast an\nevil eye upon you as a subverter of the laws, and you will confirm in the\nminds of the judges the justice of their own condemnation of you.  For he\nwho is a corrupter of the laws is more than likely to be a corrupter of the\nyoung and foolish portion of mankind.  Will you then flee from well-ordered\ncities and virtuous men? and is existence worth having on these terms?  Or\nwill you go to them without shame, and talk to them, Socrates?  And what\nwill you say to them?  What you say here about virtue and justice and\ninstitutions and laws being the best things among men?  Would that be\ndecent of you?  Surely not.  But if you go away from well-governed states\nto Crito's friends in Thessaly, where there is great disorder and licence,\nthey will be charmed to hear the tale of your escape from prison, set off\nwith ludicrous particulars of the manner in which you were wrapped in a\ngoatskin or some other disguise, and metamorphosed as the manner is of\nrunaways; but will there be no one to remind you that in your old age you\nwere not ashamed to violate the most sacred laws from a miserable desire of\na little more life?  Perhaps not, if you keep them in a good temper; but if\nthey are out of temper you will hear many degrading things; you will live,\nbut how?--as the flatterer of all men, and the servant of all men; and\ndoing what?--eating and drinking in Thessaly, having gone abroad in order\nthat you may get a dinner.  And where will be your fine sentiments about\njustice and virtue?  Say that you wish to live for the sake of your\nchildren--you want to bring them up and educate them--will you take them\ninto Thessaly and deprive them of Athenian citizenship?  Is this the\nbenefit which you will confer upon them?  Or are you under the impression\nthat they will be better cared for and educated here if you are still\nalive, although absent from them; for your friends will take care of them?\nDo you fancy that if you are an inhabitant of Thessaly they will take care\nof them, and if you are an inhabitant of the other world that they will not\ntake care of them?  Nay; but if they who call themselves friends are good\nfor anything, they will--to be sure they will.\n\n'Listen, then, Socrates, to us who have brought you up.  Think not of life\nand children first, and of justice afterwards, but of justice first, that\nyou may be justified before the princes of the world below.  For neither\nwill you nor any that belong to you be happier or holier or juster in this\nlife, or happier in another, if you do as Crito bids.  Now you depart in\ninnocence, a sufferer and not a doer of evil; a victim, not of the laws,\nbut of men.  But if you go forth, returning evil for evil, and injury for\ninjury, breaking the covenants and agreements which you have made with us,\nand wronging those whom you ought least of all to wrong, that is to say,\nyourself, your friends, your country, and us, we shall be angry with you\nwhile you live, and our brethren, the laws in the world below, will receive\nyou as an enemy; for they will know that you have done your best to destroy\nus.  Listen, then, to us and not to Crito.'\n\nThis, dear Crito, is the voice which I seem to hear murmuring in my ears,\nlike the sound of the flute in the ears of the mystic; that voice, I say,\nis humming in my ears, and prevents me from hearing any other.  And I know\nthat anything more which you may say will be vain.  Yet speak, if you have\nanything to say.\n\nCRITO:  I have nothing to say, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Leave me then, Crito, to fulfil the will of God, and to follow\nwhither he leads.\n\nNow, answer the question based on the story asconcisely as you can, using a single phrase if possible.

JACOB grabs him and shoves a rifle barrel between his \nchattering teeth.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROD\n</b>\t\tWhat's going on?\n\nBefore anyone can answer JERRY grabs his head, screaming.

He crashes into FRANK with the force of a truck. \nFRANK slams into the ground as all the air rushes from his lungs. He \nbegins gasping and hyperventilating. His eyes grow wide and frenzied as \nhe gulps for air. Fear and confusion sweep across his face. The MEN \nwatch, horrified, as FRANK's terror escalates beyond reason into all-\nout panic.\n\nSuddenly FRANK begins howling. He lunges for his bayonet and, without \nwarning, attacks the MEN around him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAUL\n</b>\t\tGod Almighty!\n\nPAUL spins out of the way as FRANK's bayonet impales the ground. JACOB \njumps on top of FRANK and wrestles him into the tall grass. PAUL rushes \nto his assistance.\n\nJACOB stares at FRANK's face as FRANK struggles beneath him. It is the \nface of a madman.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAUL\n</b>\t\tGood God! What's happening?\n\nThe sudden chaos is intensified by the sound of fighting erupting \nbehind them. Guns crackle and bursts of light penetrate the darkening \nsky.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROD\n</b>\t\tBehind you! Look out! This is it!\n\nThe MEN spin around. PAUL panics and jumps to his feet, leaving JACOB \nalone with FRANK. FRANK's eyes burn with demonic force as he gathers \nhis strength.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tDon't leave me.\n\nDark figures, silhouetted by the setting sun, are storming at them. \nSOLDIERS squint to see. It is a horrifying vision.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAUL\n</b>\t\tThey're coming!\n\nGunfire explodes on all sides. Suddenly PAUL flips out. He begins \nscreaming uncontrollably, ripping at his clothes and skin. FRANK is \nstruggling like four men and JACOB is weakening in his effort to \nrestrain him. Bayonets glimmer in the exchange of fire. Bodies fall. \nMore bodies keep coming. The first wave is upon them.\n\nROD shoots into the air. Shadowy forms hurl forward screaming like \nbanshees. ROD, squinting, jabs with his bayonet, piercing the belly of \nhis attacker. Agonizing cries accompany his fall. ROD yanks the bayonet \nout and stabs again.\n\nIn the midst of this madness FRANK shoots to his feet and slams the \nbutt of his rifle into JACOB's back. There is a cracking sound. JACOB's \neyes freeze with pain. His hands rush for his spine. As he spins around \none of the ATTACKERS jams all eight inches of his bayonet blade into \nJACOB's stomach. JACOB screams. It is a loud and piercing wail.\n\n\nCUT ON THE SOUND OF THE SCREAM to a sudden rush through a long dark \ntunnel. There is a sense of enormous speed accelerating toward a \nbrilliant light. The rush suggests a passage between life and death, \nbut as the light bursts upon us we realize that we are passing through \na SUBWAY STATION far below the city of NEW YORK.\n\n\n<b>INT.  SUBWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\nTHE WHEELS OF AN EXPRESS TRAIN screech through the station. JACOB \nSINGER, sitting alone in the last car, wakes up. The sounds of the \nscream and the grating wheels merge. He is dazed and confused, not \ncertain where he is.\n\nJACOB glances around the empty car. His eyes gravitate to overhead \nadvertisements for hemorrhoid perparations and savings banks. Gradually \nhis confusion subsides. Shifting uncomfortably he pulls a thick book \nout of his back pocket, \"The Stranger\" by Albert Camus. He begins \nreading. Another station blurs by.\n\nJACOB is a good-looking man, of obvious intelligence. He is in his mid-\nthirties. It is surprising that he is wearing a mailman's uniform. He \ndoesn't look like one.\n\nThe subway ride seems to go on interminably. JACOB is restless and \nconcerned. He glances at his watch. It is 3:30 A.M. Putting his book in \nhis back pocket, JACOB stands up and makes his way through the deserted \ncar.\n\n\n<b>INT.  SUBWAY TRACKS - NIGHT\n</b>\nJACOB enters the rumbling passageway between the cars. The wheels spark \nagainst the rails. The dark tunnel walls flash by. He pulls the handle \non the door to the next car. It is stuck. He struggles with it. A LADY \nsitting alone inside turns to look at him. She seems threatened by his \neffort. He motions for her to help. She turns away.\n\nA look of disgust crosses JACOB's face. He kicks the door. It slides \nopen. The WOMAN seems frightened as he approaches her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tExcuse me, do you know if we've\n\t\tpassed Nostrand Avenue yet?\n\t\t\t(she doesn't answer)\n\t\tExcuse me.\n\t\t\t(she does not\n\t\t\tacknowledge his\n\t\t\texistence)\n\t\tLook, I'm asking a simple question.\n\t\tHave we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell\n\t\tasleep.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n</b>\t\t\t(speaking with a Puerto\n\t\t\tRican accent)\n\t\tI no from around here.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(glad for a response)\n\t\tYeah, you and everyone else.\n\nJACOB walks to the other end of the car and sits down. The only other \npassenger is an OLD MAN lying asleep on the fiberglass bench. \nOccasionally his body shudders. It is the only sign of life in him.\n\nThe train begins to slow down. JACOB peers out of the window. Nostrand \nAvenue signs appear. He is relieved. He gets up and grabs hold of the \noverhead bar.\n\nThe OLD MAN shudders and stretches out on the seat. As he adjusts his \nposition, tugging at his coat, JACOB catches a brief glimpse of \nsomething protruding from beneath the coat's hem. His eyes fixate on \nthe spot, waiting for another look. There is a slight movement and it \nappears - a long, red, fleshy protuberance. The sight of it sends \nshivers up JACOB's spine. It looks strangely like a tail. Only the \nstopping of the train breaks JACOB's stare.\n\n\n<b>INT.  SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT\n</b>\nJACOB is the only passenger getting off. The doors close quickly behind \nhim. He glances at the LADY sitting by the window. There is a fearful \nexpression on her face as the train carries her back into the dark \ntunnel, out of his sight.\n\nJACOB reaches the exit, a huge metal revolving door surrounded by floor \nto ceiling gates. He is about to push when he notices a chain locking \nit shut. He stares at it in disbelief.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tGoddam it.\n\nHe turns in a huff and hikes to the other end of the platform. As he \napproaches the far exit, his eyes widen. The gate there is also locked. \nHis hands reach for his hips as he studies an impossible situation.\n\nCUT TO JACOB stepping cautiously onto the ladder going down to the \ntracks. A rat scampers by and he gasps.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tNo way!\n\nHe starts to climb back up the ladder but sees that there is nowhere \nelse to go. He juts out his jaw and steps back down.\n\nJACOB is not comfortable on the tracks. He cannot see where he is \nstepping. His shoes slpash in unseen liquid which makes him grimace. \nThe steel girders are coated in subway grime. The oily substance coats \nhis hands as he reaches for support.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tGoddam fucking city!\n\nHe wipes the grime on his postal uniform as he steps toward the center \ntrack. He reaches for another girder when it begins to vibrate. Two \npinpoints of light hurl toward him. Then the noise arrives confirming \nhis fear. A train is bearing down on him. JACOB looks frightened, not \nsure which way to go. He steps forward, up to his ankle in slime. He \ncannot tell which track the train is on. It is moving at phenomenal \nspeed. The station is spinning. The train's lights merge into one \nbrilliant intensity.\n\nIn near panic JACOB jumps across the track as the train spins by. Its \nvelocity blows his hair straight up as though it is standing on end. He \nclings to a pillar for support, gasping in short breaths.\n\nA few PEOPLE are staring at JACOB from the train. Their faces, pressed \nup against the glass, seem deformed. A lone figure waves at him from \nthe rear window. The train bears them all away. Then it is quiet again. \nFor a moment JACOB is afraid to move but slowly regains his composure. \nHe continues to the other side of the tracks and stumbles up the ladder \nto the UPTOWN PLATFORM.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\nJACOB smiling. The smile, however, is one of irony, not amusement. This \nexit too is locked. A heavy chain is wrapped through the bars. JACOB \nstares at it with an expression of total bewilderment.\n\nA sudden muffled scream alerts JACOB that he is not alone. His head \nturns but sees no one. He hears the scream again. He senses its \ndirection and walks toward the MEN'S ROOM. A crack of light appears \nunder the door. He can hear someone moaning inside. JACOB knocks softly \nand the moaning stops. The lights click off.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tHey, is someone in there?\n\nThere is no answer. JACOB stands silently for a moment, not sure what \nto do. He can hear whispering. He chews his lower lip nervously and \nthen reaches for the door. It pushes open.\n\nThe light from the station penetrates the darkness. He gasps. He sees a \nMAN tied naked to the stall with ANOTHER NAKED MAN grabbing quickly for \nhis clothes. The BOUND MAN screams.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBOUND MAN\n</b>\t\tFuck off! Mind your own business!\n\nA THIRD MAN spins out of the shadows, pointing a kinfe at JACOB's \nthroat.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAN\n</b>\t\tYou cocksucker! Get outta here.\n\nThe MAN's face is barely human. Before JACOB can even react the door \nslams shut. The lock engages. The crack of light reappears. JACOB can \nhear laughter coming from inside, followed by a scream. He backs away \nfrom the door. His face is white.\n\nJACOB turns with full fury and storms the gate. The chain gives wayto \nhis anger. It flies apart and the gate flings open. He stands in \namazement, observing the chain as it slides from between the bars and \ndrops to the concrete below. The gate squeaks loudly as JACOB pushes it \naside and clangs with an almost painful burst as he slams it shut.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  WILMINGTON TOWERS - DAWN\n</b>\nJACOB walks toward the towering shadows of a massive PUBLIC HOUSING \nPROJECT. It is dark and the moonlight silhouettes the huge monolithic \nstructures. JACOB passes through a vast COURTYARD dominated by the \nimposing shapes. Aside from his moving body everything is still.\n\n\n<b>INT.  HALLWAY - DAWN\n</b>\nJACOB steps off a graffiti-festooned ELEVATOR into a long impersonal \nhallway. He uses three keys to unlock the door to his APARTMENT.\n\n\n<b>INT.  JACOB'S APT. - DAWN\n</b>\nJACOB enters the darkness without turning on the light. He tries to \nnavigate his way to the BATHROOM, illuminated by a tiny nightlight in \nthe distance. His effort is unsuccessful. He bangs loudly into a table. \nA WOMAN\"s voice calls out.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE (V.O.)\n</b>\t\tJake, is that you?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWhat the hell did you do, move all\n\t\tthe furniture?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE (V.O.)\n</b>\t\tWhy didn't you turn on the light?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI didn't want to wake you.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE (V.O.)\n</b>\t\t\t(sleepy but pleasant)\n\t\tGee, thanks a lot.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWhere is the lamp?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE (V.O.)\n</b>\t\tWhere are you?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tIf I knew I wouldn't have to ask.\n\t\tWhat did you do?

JEZEBEL \"JEZZIE\" \nPIPKIN, 33, is standing in the BEDROOM door tying a man's terrycloth \nbathrobe around her waist. Although sleepy, disheveled, and not looking \nher best, it is obvious that JEZZIE is a beefy woman, juicy and \nsensual.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tThat help?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(nearly sprawled over\n\t\t\tthe couch)\n\t\tThanks.\n\nHe pushes himself up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tWhat do you think?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWhat do you mean?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tThe room!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tOh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tIt is tomorrow.

He reaches for the faucet and sends a stream of \nwater pouding against the porcelain tub. JEZZIE enjoys JACOB's \nnakedness. She reaches out to his chest and squeezes one of his \nnipples. His body tenses slightly. JEZZIE drops her robe. They enter \nthe shower together.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT\n</b>\nA DENSE RAIN falls on a dark night filling puddles of water. JACOB is \ncrawling through the underbrush in the Vietnamese JUNGLE. His shirt is \nbloodsoaked. He moves slowly, creeping on his right forearm. His left \narm is holding his intestines from spilling onto the grass.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tHelp me. Someone.\n\nSuddenly a flashlight beam can be seen in the distance. It dances \naround the bamboo trees and draws closer to JACOB. It is impossible to \nsee who is carrying it. The light darts near the ground where JACOB is \nlying and then bursts directly into his eyes.\n\n\n<b>INT.  JACOB'S APT. - DAY\n</b>\nSUNLIGHT pours through the BEDROOM window. JACOB is sleeping fitfully \nas a bar of light saturates his face. His hand rushes up to cover and \nprotect his eyes but the damage is done. He is awake.\n\nJACOB lies in bed for a few moments, dazed. Slowly his hand gropes \nalong the shelf at the head of the bed, searching for his glasses. He \nhas trouble finding them. As his hand sweeps blindly across the \nheadboard it hits the telephone and sends it crashing to the floor. He \nsits up with a disgusted look on his face and searches the out-of-focus \nshelf behind him. Suddenly JEZZIE enters.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tYou up?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tNo. Have you seen my glasses?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\t\t(shaking her head)\n\t\tWhere'd you leave 'em?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI don't know.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tDid you look around the headboard?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(wearily)\n\t\tJezzie, I can't see.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\t\t(she scans the shelf)\n\t\tMaybe you left 'em in the bathroom.\n\nShe leaves and returns moments later with his glasses and a large paper \nbag.

Do me a favor. Bring 'em to\n\t\tthe back room.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tThey're awfully heavy.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n</b>\t\tI know. That's why I'm asking.\n\nJACOB waddles reluctantly toward the back of the store. CHINESE \nLAUNDERERS are hovering over piles of clothes. Steam from the pressing \nmachines shoots into the air.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(huffing and puffing)\n\t\tWhere's Wong?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n</b>\t\tThat's what I'd like to know. If you\n\t\tsee him on the street somewhere, tell\n\t\thim he's fired.\n\nJACOB stoops to put the boxes on the shelf. There is a snapping sound \nand he winces in pain. Massaging his back, JACOB unfolds some papers \nfor the WOMAN's signature.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tHow was Palm Springs?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n</b>\t\tHot. Where do I sign?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(pointing to the line)\n\t\tYou got a nice tan, though.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n</b>\t\tTan? What tan? It faded on the\n\t\tairplane. I'd try to get my money\n\t\tback, but who do you ask?\n\t\t\t(she looks heavenward)\n\t\tTwo hundred dollars a night, for\n\t\twhat?\n\nShe hands JACOB the wrong sheet.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tNo. I'll take the other one.\n\t\t\t(he takes it)\n\t\tRight. Well it's good to have you\n\t\tback. See you tomorrow, probably.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n</b>\t\tIf you're lucky.\n\nJACOB smiles to himself as he leaves the store. He walks carefully. His \nback is out.\n\n\n<b>INT.  MAIL TRUCK - DAY\n</b>\nANGLE ON THE MAIL TRUCK stuck in traffic. Nothing is moving. Horns are \nblaring and drivers are agitated. JACOB reaches for a newspaper lying \non top of his mail bags. To his shock one of the bags appears to move. \nCurious, JACOB pokes at it. Instantly a terrifying figure pops out from \nbeneath it and stares at him with a frightening glare. JACOB jumps \nback, stunned. It is a moment before he realizes that he is looking at \nan old WINO who has been sleeping in the truck. The man's face is \ncovered in strange bumps.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tGoddamn it! What the hell ... ?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWINO\n</b>\t\t\t(pleading)\n\t\tI didn't take nothin'. I was just\n\t\tnapping. Don't hit me. I was cold.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(lifting the man up)\n\t\tWhat the hell do you think you're\n\t\tdoing? You can't do this. This is\n\t\tgovernment property.\n\nHe begins opening the door. The WINO begs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWINO\n</b>\t\tDon't throw me out. They're gonna get\n\t\tme. They'll tear me to pieces.\n\nHe holds on to JACOB's leg. JACOB tries to pull away.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tCome on. You can't stay here.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWINO\n</b>\t\tPlease! I never hurt anybody when I\n\t\twas alive. Believe me. I don't belong\n\t\there.\n\nJACOB gives the WINO a strange look and then escorts him from the \ntruck. A hundred eyes peer out of motionless cars and follow him as he \nleads the WINO to the sidewalk. JACOB pulls a dollar bill from his \npocket and places it in the WINO's hand. The OLD MAN crumples it into a \nball and turns away. He has a frightened look on his face. JACOB \nreturns to the truck shaking his head.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tNew York!\n\nHe climbs into his seat and glances into his rear view mirror. He \nnotices the WINO edging fearfully along the side of a building. A horn \nhonks and traffic begins moving. When JACOB looks back the WINO is no \nlonger there.\n\n\n<b>INT.  GARAGE - DAY\n</b>\nJACOB drives his mail truck into the huge POST OFFICE PARKING GARAGE on \n34th Street. His mind seems distracted. He has difficulty parking.\n\n\n<b>INT.  POST OFFICE - DAY\n</b>\nWe see a vast room filled with hundreds of PEOPLE sorting and moving \nmail.\n\nJACOB, carrying a bag of McDonald's hamburgers, walks stiffly through \nthe aisles, his left hand rubbing his back. Several workers greet him \nand grab for his french fries. He offers them around.\n\nANGLE ON a conveyor belt sorting mail. A hand reaches in, correcting \nmistakes. Suddenly a hamburger passes by. JEZZIE looks up and smiles.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tJake!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tHow's it going?\n\nShe takes the hamburger and shrugs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tI'm going home.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tWhat's wrong?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI don't know. One of these days, I'm\n\t\tgonna see Louis. My back's killing\n\t\tme.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tNow? What about the boss? He's not\n\t\tgonna like it.\n\nJACOB shrugs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWell, I'll miss riding home with you.\n\t\tI was looking forward to it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI'll be glad to avoid the crush.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tI enjoy crushing into you.\n\nShe grabs him and hugs him tightly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tGently. My back.\n\nJEZZIE ignores him and squeezes again.\n\n\n<b>INT.  CHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - DAY\n</b>\nCUT ON A SCREAM to JACOB in a CHIROPRACTOR'S OFFICE. He is lying on a \nlong leather padded device that looks like an instrument of torture. \nLOUIS, the Chiropractor, is a giant of a man, 280 pounds. He is \nadjusting JACOB's spine.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tCome on, Jake. That didn't hurt.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tHow do you know?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tI know you. How come you're so tense\n\t\ttoday?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWhat can I tell you?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tI saw Sarah the other day.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tHer knee acting up?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tA bit.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWhat did she have to say?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tTurn on your right side.\n\t\t\t(he turns on his left)\n\t\tHow about the other \"right?\"\n\t\t\t(JACOB turns back)\n\t\tI don't understand you philosphers.\n\t\tYou've got the whole world figured\n\t\tout but you can't remember the\n\t\tdifference between right and left.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI was absent the day they taught that\n\t\tin school.

No wonder your marriage\n\t\tdidn't last. Put your hand under your\n\t\thead. Take a breath and then let it\n\t\tout.\n\nHe makes a rapid adjustment pushing down on JACOB's thigh. JACOB \ngroans.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tAh, good. Now turn to your left.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tShe talk about the boys?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tShe says she can't get them new coats\n\t\tbecause you haven't sent the alimony\n\t\tfor three months.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tShe told you that?\n\t\t\t(he shakes his head)\n\t\tDid she tell you about the $2,000 I'm\n\t\tstill paying for the orthodontist?\n\t\tI'll bet she didn't mention that.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tShe said you were a son of a bitch\n\t\tand she regrets the day she set eyes\n\t\ton you.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI thought you said she didn't say\n\t\tmuch.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tShe didn't. That's about all she\n\t\tsaid. Put your hand up. Good. I think\n\t\tshe still loves you. Take a breath\n\t\tand let it out.\n\nHe makes an adjustment. JACOB screams.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tLoves me!? She hasn't said a kind\n\t\tword about me in years!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tRight. She doesn't stop talking about\n\t\tyou. You're always on her mind.\n\t\tThat's love, Jake.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tShe hates me, Louis.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tYou should go back to her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWhat? She threw me out, remember. She\n\t\twanted some professor to carry her\n\t\tfar away from Brooklyn. Only we\n\t\tdidn't make it. She can't forgive me\n\t\tthat she still lives in the same\n\t\thouse she grew up in.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tHer problem is that you spent eight\n\t\tyears getting a PhD and then went to\n\t\twork for the post office.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWhat can I tell you, Louis? After Nam\n\t\tI didn't want to think anymore. I\n\t\tdecided my brain was too small an\n\t\torgan to comprehend this chaos.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\t\t(looking at JACOB with\n\t\t\taffection)\n\t\tIf it was any other brain but yours,\n\t\tI might agree. Relax, this is going\n\t\tto be strong.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI can't relax.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tWiggle your toes.\n\nJACOB wiggles his toes. At that instant, LOUIS twists JACOB's neck \nrapidly. There is a loud cracking sound.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT\n</b>\nTHERE IS A FLASH OF LIGHT. A MAN rushes at the camera yelling.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAN\n</b>\t\tI found one. He's alive.\n\nHe shines a flashlight into the lens creating rings and halos.\n\n\n<b>CHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - DAY\n</b>\nSuddenly LOUIS reappears, a halo effect still visible behind his head.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tGod almighty. What did you do to me?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tI had to get in there. A deep\n\t\tadjustment. Rest a moment and let it\n\t\tset a bit.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI had this weird flash just then.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tWhat?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI don't know.

Anyone\n\t\tever tell you that?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tYeah. You. Every time I see you. No\n\t\tmore Errol Flynn, okay? Your back\n\t\twon't take it.

BROOKLYN STREETS - EVENING\n</b>\nJACOB is walking down Nostrand Avenue. He is singing to himself and \nimitating Al Jolson.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWhen there are gray skies, I don't\n\t\tmind the gray skies, as long as\n\t\tthere's you ...\n\nHe hums. It is near dusk and lights are just coming on. The shop \nwindows have a particularly garish look about them. The mannequins are \ndressed in inexpensive, almost tawdry, clothes and have a pathetic \nappearance. A few shops have set up their Christmas decorations.\n\nThe ornamentation seems strangely out of place; almost blasphemous.\n\nJACOB passes a street gang standing in the doorway of a local drug \nstore. They chortle and make taunting sounds.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGIRL\n</b>\t\t\t(shaking her tits,\n\t\t\tsinging)\n\t\t\"Hey, Mr. Postman ... \"\n\nJACOB stops and stares at them. To their surprise, he begins to sing \nwith them. He knows the words. They like that. It is a sweet moment.\n\nJACOB continues walking. He comes to a cross street. The light is \ngreen. He is still singing to himself and does not notice a BLACK CAR \nsharging around the corner. The car is moving at full speed, heading \nstraight toward him. A YOUNG MAN walking a few steps behind yells out.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYOUNG MAN\n</b>\t\tLook out!\n\nJACOB turns and sees the car. He scoots out of the way but it swerves \nin his direction. The YOUNG MAN calls out again.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYOUNG MAN\n</b>\t\tJump!\n\nWith a huge thrust, JACOB hurls himself onto the curb as the car shoots \nby. Two MEN are peering at him from the back seat. They are laughing \nlike madmen and shaking their heads. They do not look human. JACOB \nyells and waves his fist, to no effect. After a moment he turns to \nthank the YOUNG MAN whose scream had saved him, but he is gone.\n\n\n<b>INT.  JACOB'S APT. - DUSK\n</b>\nJACOB and JEZZIE are lying in bed. They are a sensual couple and even \nin quiet, reflective moments such as this, their positioning is erotic \nand stimulating. Both of them are nude. JACOB's hands are clasped \nbehind his neck and he is staring mournfully at the ceiling. JEZZIE is \nlying on her side, her left leg draped across JACOB's pelvis. Her head \nis propped up on her right arm while her left hand strokes the bayonet \nscar on JACOB's stomach. Neither are talking. Suddenly, out of the \nblue, JEZZIE speaks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tMaybe it's all the pressure, Jake.\n\t\tThe money. Things like that. Or your\n\t\twife.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWhy do you bring her up?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\t'Cause she's always on your mind.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWhen was the last time I said a word?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tIt has nothin' to do with talkin'.\n\nShe pauses for a while, long enough to suppose that the conversation is \nover. Then she continues.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tOr maybe it's the war.\n\nJACOB closes his eyes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tIt's still there, Jake.\n\t\t\t(she points to his\n\t\t\tbrain)\n\t\tEven if you never say a word about\n\t\tit. You can't spend two years in\n\t\tVietnam ...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(annoyed)\n\t\tWhat does that have to do with\n\t\tanything? Does it explain the\n\t\tbarricaded subway stations? Does it\n\t\texplain those Godforsaken creatures?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tNew York is filled with creatures.\n\t\tEverywhere. And lots of stations are\n\t\tclosed.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tThey're like demons, Jez.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tDemons, Jake? Come on. They're winos\n\t\tand bag ladies. Low life. That's all\n\t\tthey are. The streets are crawling\n\t\twith 'em. Don't make em into\n\t\tsomethin' they're not.\n\t\t\t(she rubs his forehead)\n\t\tIt's the pressure, honey. That's all\n\t\tit is.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tThose guys tried to kill me tonight.\n\t\tThey were aiming right at me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tKids on a joy ride.

JEZZIE stares at \nhis naked back and drags her fingernails down to his buttocks. Scratch \nmarks follow in their wake.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tYou still love me?\n\nHe does not respond.\n\n\n<b>INT.  JACOB'S KITCHEN - DAY\n</b>\nJACOB and JEZZIE are sitting at the breakfast table. JEZZIE is reading \nthe National Enquirer and chewing at her lip. Suddenly a drop of blood \nforms and falls onto the formica table top. Staring at it for a moment, \nshe wipes it with her finger and then licks it with her tongue.\n\nJACOB is nursing a cup of coffee and staring out the window at the \nhousing project across the way. The toaster pops. JEZZIE jumps. She \ngets up, butters her toast, and returns to her paper.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tSays here the world's comin' to an\n\t\tend. The battle of heaven and hell\n\t\tthey call it.

God, look at this. Two\n\t\theads. Only lived two days. A day for\n\t\teach head. Could you imagine me with\n\t\ttwo heads? We'd probably keep each\n\t\tother up all night - arguing and\n\t\twhatnot. You wanna see the picture?\n\nHe does not respond. JEZZIE gets up and walks over to JACOB. Standing \nin front of him she slowly unties her robe and lets it fall apart. She \nis naked underneath it. Sensuously she leans forward, unbuttons his \nshirt, and strokes his chest. She waits for a response from him, but \nthere is none. He sits silently, disinterested.\n\nFurious, JEZZIE turns away. Grabbing the vacuum cleaner from the broom \ncloset she angrily unravels the cord and switches it on. Breasts flash \nfrom beneath her gown as the vacuum roars back and forth across the \nfloor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tGoddamn you son-of-a-bitch! My\n\t\tuncle's dogs used to treat me better\n\t\tthan you do. At least they'd lick my\n\t\ttoes once in a while. At least they\n\t\tshowed some fucking interest.\n\nA NEIGHBOR bangs on the wall, shouting.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tAll right! All right! All right!\n\nJACOB peers at the courtyard eighteen stories below and watches the \npatterns of early morning movement. Tiny figures drift purposefully \nover the concrete.\n\nSuddenly the vasuum cleaner goes off. In the silence, JACOB realizes \nthat JEZZIE is crying and turns to see her curled over the kitchen \ntable. He walks to her side and strokes her hair. JEZZIE begins to sob. \nAfter a moment she looks at him with puffy eyes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tYou love me?\n\nHe nods his head \"yes.\" She smiles coyly and rubs her hair like a \nkitten against his crotch. After a few moments she speaks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tDella's party's tonight. Why don't we\n\t\tgo? It'll take your minf offa things.\n\t\tAnd I won't make you dance. I\n\t\tpromise. Huh?\n\t\t\t(he nods his head in\n\t\t\tconsent. JEZZIE hugs\n\t\t\thim)\n\t\tYou still love me, Jake?\n\nHe nods his head again, only heavily, as though the question exhausts \nhim.\n\n\n<b>INT.  BELLVUE HOSPITAL - DAY\n</b>\nJACOB is in the \"Mental Health Clinic\" at BELLVUE HOSPITAL walking \nthrough the PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY ROOM. It is overflowing with people. \nSome are handcuffed to their chairs. POLICEMEN are with them. JACOB \napproaches the main RECEPTION DESK. He speaks nervously.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson,\n\t\tplease.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRECEPTIONIST\n</b>\t\tCarlson? Is he new here?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tNew?

Carlson knows me.\n\nJACOB pounds the desk, rattling a tiny African violet and knocking the \nRECEPTIONIST's forms to the floor. She grunts angrily and stoops to \nretrieve them. Standing up her cap hits a drawer handle and slips off. \nTWO KNUCKLE-LIKE HORNS protrude from her skull where the cap had been. \nJACOB's eyes lock on them like radar. He backs away. She immediately \nreplaces her cap and breaks the spell, but her eyes glare at him with \ndemonic intensity. JACOB, freaked, angry, turns and runs toward the \"In \nPatient\" door.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRECEPTIONIST\n</b>\t\tHey! You can't go in there!\n\nJACOB doesn't stop. A POLICEMAN, guarding the entrance, runs after him.\n\n\nJACOB charges through the interior corridors of the aging institution. \nA LINE OF MENTAL PATIENTS, all holding hands, is moving down the hall. \nThey break ranks as he charges by and begin to scream. Their ATTENDANT \ntries to calm them down but the sight of the POLICEMAN increases their \nhysteria. They grab hold of him as he tries to get by.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPOLICEMAN\n</b><b>\t\tLET GO!

They say it blew up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(growing pale)\n\t\tBlew up? What do you mean it blew up?\n\nThe LEADER shrugs and tries to put his arm around JACOB, but he pulls \naway.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLEADER\n</b>\t\tDo you want me to get someone?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tNo. No. It's okay. I'm okay.\n\nHe backs quickly to the door. As he turns to leave he realizes that all \nof the PEOPLE in the group are watching him intently.\n\n\nUnsettled, JACOB hurries back into the hallway. He is frightened and \nconfused. Suddenly a voice calls out.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPOLICEMAN\n</b><b>\t\tHEY YOU! MAILMAN!\n</b>\nJACOB turns and sees the POLICEMAN waiting for him. His gun is drawn.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPOLICEMAN\n</b>\t\tHold it. Just hold it. Where the hell\n\t\tdo you think you are? This is\n\t\tBellevue, for God's sake. People\n\t\trunning around here get shot.\n\nThe GROUP LEADER pokes his head out of the door and motions to the \n<b>POLICEMAN.\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tLEADER\n</b>\t\tIt's alright. He's okay.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPOLICEMAN\n</b>\t\t\t(nodding, reholstering\n\t\t\this gun)\n\t\tCome on, get out of here. I wouldn't\n\t\twant to interfere with the U.S. Mail.\n\nHe leads JACOB toward the lobby. JACOB does not look back.\n\n\n<b>INT.  DELLA'S APT. - NIGHT\n</b>\nWE HEAR LOUD DANCE MUSIC. SLY AND THE FAMILY STONE. JACOB is with some \nPOST OFFICE EMPLOYEES at a crowded party in a small apartment. A DRUNK \nis telling a bad joke and trying to hold a glass of wine at the same \ntime. It is constantly on the verge of spilling. JACOB is fixated on \nit. In the background, we see JEZZIE dancing and motioning for JACOB to \njoin her. He nods no. The DRUNK, who keeps asking people if they \"get \nit,\" takes JACOB's head nodding as a sign of confusion and keeps trying \nto re-explain the joke.\n\nJACOB hears a strange noise and looks around. It seems to be coming \nfrom a covered bird cage. He goes over to it and lifts the cover. The \nBIRD is flapping its wings wildly as if trying to get out. The sound, \nloud and insistent, startles him. He lowers the cover.\n\nIn the DINING ROOM, several people are gathered around ELSA, an \nattractive black woman who is reading palms. She sees JACOB and calls \nover the music.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELSA\n</b>\t\tHey, you! Let me look at your hand!\n\nJACOB shrugs. DELLA, dancing nearby, calls out.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDELLA\n</b>\t\tGo on Jake. She reads 'em like a\n\t\tbook.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tNo, thanks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDELLA\n</b>\t\tIt's fun.\n\nCUT TO A CLOSE UP OF JACOB'S HAND. ELSA is squeezing the mounds and \nexamining the lines. What begins as a playful expression on her face \nturns suddenly serious. She reaches for his other hand and compares the \ntwo of them. JEZZIE looks over from her dancing and eyes the scene \njealously.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELSA\n</b>\t\tYou have an unusual hand.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI could have told you that.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELSA\n</b>\t\tYou see this line here? It's your\n\t\tlife line. Here's where you were\n\t\tborn. And this is where you got\n\t\tmarried. You're a married man, huh?\n\t\tOh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split.\n\nShe studies his life line with growing concern. JEZZIE tries to get \nJACOB's attention. He ignores her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELSA\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tYou know, you got a strange line\n\t\there.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(examining it)\n\t\tIt's short, huh?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELSA\n</b>\t\tShort? It's ended.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(laughing)\n\t\tOh, terrific.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELSA\n</b>\t\tIt's not funny. According to this ...\n\t\tyou're already dead.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(smiling)\n\t\tJust my luck.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\nTHE DANCERS. Their movements are loose and getting looser. The music is \nstrong and insistent. The smokey atmosphere disfigures the dancers and \ngives them a strange, distorted appearance. Suddenly JEZZIE breaks from \nthe crowd and reaches for JACOB. He pulls away. Some of the MALE \nDANCERS call out to him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDANCERS\n</b>\t\tCome on man, show your stuff.\n\nJACOB is easily intimidated. Relenting, he glares at JEZZIE and nods \napologetically to ELSA. It is obvious that he is embarrassed at his \ninadequacy on the dance floor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAN\n</b>\t\tCome on professor. You got feet, too.\n\nJACOB tries to smile but it is pained and unconvincing. JEZZIE is \nplaying with him, mimicking his movement. A number of DANCERS notice \nand laugh, which only increases his discomfort. JEZZIE's taunting has a \nstrange effect on JACOB. He grows distant and withdrawn, even though \nhis body is still going through the motions of the dance.\n\nA MAN taps JEZZIE on the shoulder. She spins around, smiling, and \nbegins dancing with him. JACOB is left alone, dancing by himself. He \nlooks away, uncomfortable.\n\nIn the shadows a WOMAN kneels close to the floor. She seems to be \nurinating on the carpet. JACOB is shocked. Several DANCERS obscure his \nview. He turns around.\n\nA PREGNANT WOMAN stands half naked in the kitchen. JACOB cannot believe \nwhat he sees.\n\nIn the next room, past JEZZIE, JACOB glimpses a terrifying image, a MAN \nwhose head seems to be vibrating at such enormous speed that it has \nlost all definition. Something about the image compels and frightens \nJACOB. Slowly he approaches it. As he draws nearer to it the tortured \nimage lets out a scream of such pain and unearthly terror that JACOB \nbacks away.\n\nA WOMAN, laughing, grabs JACOB, spins him around, and begins dancing \nwith him. He is totally disoriented.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n</b>\t\tHold me, baby!\n\nShe takes JACOB's arm and guides it to her back. THE CAMERA follows his \nhand as it reaches the smooth skin beneath her sexy, loose fitting \ndress. He runs his fingers up to her shoulder blades. Then, suddenly, \nhe recoils. Her back is a mass of shoulder blades, hundreds of strange, \nbony protrusions. JACOB gasps. Out of the blue, JEZZIE leans into him \nand wiggles her tongue in his ear. JACOB, startled, jerks his head and \nhis glasses go flying to the floor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tShit!\n\nHe stoops down blindly to pick them up. Shoes just miss his fingers as \nhe digs between dancing legs trying to recover them. Miraculously, he \ngrabs the spectacles just before they are crushed and slips them back \non. Instantly his world comes back into focus.\n\nAs he stands, JACOB is surprised to find JEZZIE facing him, gyrating in \nwild abandon. There is a huge, satisfied smile on her face. She grabs \nhis hand as if encouraging him to dance but it is obvious that she is \ndancing to her own rhythm. JACOB stares at her, confused. It takes him \na moment to realize that her smile is not for him.\n\nStanding behind JEZZIE is another DANCER, his hands around her waist. \nThey are moving together, locked in erotic embrace. It appears that he \nis mounting her from behind. Looking down we see that the DANCER's feet \nare deformed. They have a bizarre clubbed appearance and look very much \nlike hooves. They skid and careen amidst the dancing feet.\n\nSomething horrible and winglike flaps behind JEZZIE's back. We cannot \nmake out what it is, but it elicits a primal terror. Before JACOB can \nreact, JEZZIE opens her mouth. With a roaring sound, a spiked horn \nerupts from her throat. It juts menacingly from between her teeth and \nthrusts into the air. A CIRCLE OF DANCERS scream out in excited \napproval.\n\nCUT TO JACOB's face as it registers terror and disbelief. He stares at \nthe DANCERS who are crowding around him. They have become perverse, \ncorrupt aspects of their normal selves.\n\nJACOB grabs his eyes as though trying to pull the vision from his head \nbut it won't go away. The music throbs. His actions become spastic, \nalmost delirious.\n\nJACOB is out of control. His frenzy becomes a kind of exorcism, a \ndesperate attempt to free himself from his body and his mind. WE MOVE \nIN ON HIM as his eyes pass beyond pain. The dark walls of the APARTMENT \nfade away.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT\n</b>\nStrange faces in infantry helmets appear in the darkness, outlined by a \nbright moon that is emerging from behind a cloud. The faces are looking \ndown and voices are speaking.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE\n</b>\t\tHe's burning up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE\n</b>\t\tTotal delirium.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE\n</b>\t\tThat's some gash.

Rings of light emenate from it filling the \nsky with their sparkling brilliance. The rings draw us forward with a \nquickening intensity that grows into exhilarating speed. The rush \ncauses them to flash stroboscopically and produces a dazzling, almost \nsensual, surge of color. The display is spectacular and compelling.\n\nMusic can be heard in the distance, growing hard and insistent, like a \nheart beat. Heavy breathing accompanies the sound. The stroboscopic \nflashes are replaced by intense flashes of red and blue light. The \nmusic grows louder and reaches a thundering crescendo. Then silence.\n\n\n<b>INT.  DELLA'S APT. - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe APARTMENT reappears in all its normalcy. The neon sign is still \nflashing outside the window. DANCERS are smiling and sweating.\n\nCheers and applause ring out for JACOB and JEZZIE but JACOB barely \nhears them. JEZZIE hugs him tightly. PEOPLE smack him on the back.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tADMIRER\n</b>\t\tYou are out of your mind, man. Out of\n\t\tyour fuckin' mind.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n</b>\t\tJake, you little devil. You never\n\t\ttold me you could dance like that.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAN\n</b>\t\tJezzie, what did you put in his\n\t\tdrink?\n\nJEZZIE smiles while pulling JACOB to a corner chair. He plops down. His \nchest is heaving and he is grabbing hold of his stomach. Hie face is \nfrightened and distorted.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tYou okay?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI wanna leave.

Annoyed, JEZZIE leaves JACOB and \ncrosses the room. He watches her as she goes. JACOB is holding his \nstomach and rocking painfully. Moments later JEZZIE returns with DELLA.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDELLA\n</b>\t\tHiya Jake.

He pulls it up around his shoulders. The whole bed \nvibrates with his shivering. Suddenly JEZZIE rushes through the BEDROOM \nand into the BATHROOM. SHe turns on the bath water.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWhat the hell are you doin'?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tGet your clothes off.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWhat are you talking about?

A \nYOUNG BOY enters the room, carrying a musical LUNCH BOX in his arms. He \nis wearing a long T-shirt nearly down to his ankles. We recognize him \nfrom his photograph. It is GABE.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGABE\n</b>\t\tDaddy, what was that noise?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(surprised to see him)\n\t\tGabe?\n\t\t\t(he stares curiously at\n\t\t\this son)\n\t\tWhat are you doing ... ?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGABE\n</b>\t\tThere was a bang.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tIt was the window.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGABE\n</b>\t\tIt's cold.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tTell your mother.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGABE\n</b>\t\tMom, it's ...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSARAH\n</b>\t\tI heard you.

He whisks GABE \nupside down and carries him into his\n\n\n<b>GABE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nBEDROOM, licking his belly and tickling him all the way. GABE laughs \nand snuggles into his pillow as soon as he hits the bed. JED, 9, and \nELI, 7, are both in bunk beds across the room. JED looks up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJED\n</b>\t\tDad?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tJed.

SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nJACOB settles back into bed. SARAH turns over and gets comfortable. \nJACOB lies on his back facing the ceiling. He pulls the blankets up to \nhis neck. He is overcome with feelings of sadness and longing.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI love you, Sarah.\n\nShe smiles warmly. His eyes close and in a matter of seconds he is back \nasleep.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  VIETNAM - PRE DAWN\n</b>\nWE HEAR SUMMER MORNING SOUNDS, CRICKETS and BIRDS. The image of trees \nmaterializes overhead and a beautiful pink sky, just before sunrise, \ncan be seen through the branches. It is an idyllic setting.\n\nSuddenly a strange sound can be heard in the distance, a metallic \nhumming, growing louder. There is a scramble of feet and a sound of \nheavy boots moving through the tall grass. Voices can be heard. Men's \nvoices.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE\n</b>\t\tThey're here.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE\n</b>\t\tThank God. Move 'em out!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICES\n</b>\t\tBust your balls!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE\n</b>\t\tMove it! Move it!\n\nThere is an instant swell of activity. Trees and branches blur and \nspeed by overhead. The idyllic image of moments before reveals itself \nas a P.O.V. SHOT. The CAMERA races out of a JUNGLE covering and into a \nhuge CLEARING.\n\nHigh overhead a helicopter appears. Its blades whirl with a deafening \nwhine. Long lines drop from its belly and dangle in mid-air. SOLDIERS \nleap up into the air reaching for them. The air is filled with \nturbulence. Tarps fly off dead bodies. SOLDIERS hold them down. Voices \nyell but the words are not clear. They are filled with urgency.\n\nThe CAMERA leaves the ground. The edges of the sky disappear as the \nhelicopter's gray mass fills the frame. It grows larger and darker as \nthe CAMERA approaches. Rivets and insignias dotting the underbelly come \ninto view. Suddenly the stretcher begins spinning, out of control. \nHands emerge from inside, reaching out to grab it.\n\nWatery, womb-like sounds rise out of nowhere, the rippling of water, a \nheart beating. Gradually voices can be heard mumbling; distant sounds, \nwarm and familiar.\n\n\n<b>INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nJACOB's DOCTOR reaches down to help him out of the tub. Surprisingly \nJEZZIE and MRS. CARMICHAEL are standing there too. JACOB stares at them \nin total confusion.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDOCTOR\n</b>\t\tYou are a lucky man, my friend. A\n\t\tlucky man. You must have friends in\n\t\thigh places, that's all I can say.\n\nSAM and TONY appear next to the DOCTOR. They are extending their hands \nto the P.O.V. CAMERA. JACOB'S arms, nearly blue, reach out to them.\n\nSlowly they lift him from the icy water. JACOB takes one step onto the \ntile and collapses to the floor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO BLACK:\n</b>\n\n<b>INT.  JACOB'S BEDROOM - DAY\n</b>\nFADE IN sounds of feet shuffling across the carpet. A glass rattles on \na tray. A television is on low in the background. Slowly the CAMERA \nLENS opens from JACOB's P.O.V. and we see JEZZIE puttering around the \nBEDROOM. Suddenly she is aware that JACOB is watching her. She smiles.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tJake.\n\t\t\t(she places her hand on\n\t\t\this head and strokes his\n\t\t\thair)\n\t\tYou're gonna be all right, Jake.\n\t\tYou're gonna be fine.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tAm I home?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tYou're here.

And talkin'\n\t\tto your kids. Even the dead one.\n\t\tWeird. You know you melted 200 pounds\n\t\tof ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tAre we in Brooklyn?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tYou're right here, Jake.

You can't do\n\t\tanything for a week. He says you\n\t\tgotta recuperate.\n\t\t\t(she strokes his\n\t\t\tforehead, and gets up)\n\t\tNow you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman\n\t\tmade you some chicken soup. It'll\n\t\twarm you up.\n\nJEZZIE leaves the room. JACOB watches her as she goes. He seems lost \nand confused.\n\n\n<b>INT.  JACOB'S KITCHEN - DAY\n</b>\nJACOB, unshaven, wearing his bathrobe, is sitting at the KITCHEN TABLE. \nPILES OF BOOKS on demonology are spread out before him. He studies them \nto distraction. JEZZIE is standing by the counter making sandwiches. \nShe wraps them in plastic Baggies and puts one in a lunch box, another \nin the refrigerator. She is dressed in her postal uniform.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tYou know, you really ought to get out\n\t\ttoday. You can't just sit around like\n\t\tthis all the time.

Anybody home?\n\t\t\t(she looks in his ear)\n\t\tAnybody in there?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWhat?\n\nJEZZIE just stares at him. She does not respond. JACOB returns to his \nbooks.\n\nCUT TO CLOSE UP IMAGES OF WINGED DEMONS, real demons, with spindly \nhorns and long tails. JACOB's huge finger, magnified, scans page after \npage of ancient images and archaic text. JEZZIE, enraged at his lack of \nattention, returns to packing her lunch box. Suddenly she spins around.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tGoddamn it! I can't stand it anymore.\n\t\tI've had it up to here. Go ahead and\n\t\trot if you want ... You son-of-a-\n\t\tbitch, I'm talking to you.\n\nCUT BACK to the DEMONS. Suddenly a crashing sound catches JACOB's \nattention as a KITCHEN POT flies by his head. He looks up to see JEZZIE \nknocking pots and pans off the kitchen counter and kicking them wildly \nacross the room. The noise is terrible. The intensity of her rage is \nshocking. The pots crash into every surface, knocking all his books \nonto the floor. And then, suddenly, she stops.\n\nJEZZIE stoops down to the floor and picks up her sandwich, stuffs it \nback in its plastic Baggie, and puts it back in her lunch box. She is \nabout to leave when she stops and looks at JACOB.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing, her anger\n\t\t\tin check)\n\t\tI made you a tuna fish sandwich. It's\n\t\tin the fridge.

Listen, I gotta go.\n\nJEZZIE sits on his lap, gives him a big kiss, and then, unexpectedly, \nraises two fingers, like horns, over her head. The gesture catches \nJACOB's full attention.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tLook, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.\n\t\t\t(she kisses his cheek)\n\t\tLove me a little?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(speaking with\n\t\t\taffection)\n\t\tYou are the most unbelievable woman I\n\t\thave ever met.

Tell 'em I've left.\n\nJEZZIE grabs her jacket and shoves her arm in it upside down. A \npocketful of change falls on the floor. JACOB smiles. JEZZIE curses as \nshe struggles to pick it up and get the jacket on right. JACOB gets the \nphone.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tHello.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAUL (V.O.)\n</b>\t\tJacob Singer?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tSpeaking.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAUL (V.O.)\n</b>\t\tPaul Gruneger!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tPaul Gruneger!

BAR - DAY\n</b>\nJACOB and PAUL are sitting in a dark booth in an obscure WILLIAMSBURG \nBAR. It is nearly empty. PAUL is leaning across the table in a very \nintimate fashion.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAUL\n</b>\t\tSomethin's wrong, Jake. I don't know\n\t\twhat it is but I can't talk to\n\t\tanybody about it.

I'm\n\t\tgonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.\n\nPAUL cannot contain his fear. He jumps up suddenly and walks away from \nthe booth. JACOB follows him with his eyes but does not go after him. A \nYOUNG MAN in the next booth observes the scene with interest. He looks \nvaguely familiar, like we have seen him before.\n\nPAUL stares out the window for a moment and then walks over to the juke \nbox. He pulls a quarter out of his pocket and drops it in the slot. His \nfinger pushes a selection at random. Some '60's rock hit blares out. \nJACOB's mind is reeling by the time PAUL sits back down.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAUL\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tSorry.

Help\n\t\tme Jake.\n\nJACOB slides quickly out of his side of the booth and moves in toward \nPAUL. He puts his arm around him and holds him tightly, offering \ncomfort as best he can.\n\nPAUL is obviously terrified and grateful for JACOB's gesture. A few \nPEOPLE at the bar look over in their direction.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tIt's okay, Paul.

PAUL inserts the key into the ignition and \nsteps on the gas. He turns the key.\n\nTHE CAR EXPLODES. Pieces of metal and flesh fly into the air. JACOB \nsprawls out flat on the ground as the debris hurls above him. He covers \nhis head.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  VIETNAM\n</b>\nCUT TO A HELICOPTER suffering an air bombardment. Flack is exploding \nall around it and the shock waves are rocking the craft violently. \nJACOB's eyes peer to the left.\n\nINFANTRY GUNNERS are firing rockets into the JUNGLE below. A pair of \nMEDICS are huddled over him. A sudden gush of arterial bleeding sends a \nstream of blood splattering over the inside of the windshield. The \nPILOT, unable to see, clears it away with his hands.\n\nJACOB screams over the roar of the chopper. One of the MEDICS presses \nhis ear close to JACOB to hear.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tHelp me!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMEDIC\n</b>\t\tWe're doing the best we can.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tGet me out of here!\n\n\n<b>EXT.  BAR - DAY\n</b>\nTHE YOUNG MAN from the bar grabs JACOB under the arms and drags him \ndown the sidewalk.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYOUNG MAN\n</b>\t\tJust hold on.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWhere am I? Who are you?\n\nThe YOUNG MAN yanks JACOB around the corner just as another explosion \nconsumes the car. The air is filled with flames and flying debris. The \nYOUNG MAN pulls JACOB into the bar.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tYOUNG MAN\n</b>\t\tJust lie still. You're okay. You're\n\t\tnot hurt.\n\nThe CUSTOMERS are in a state of bedlam. Part of the wall has blown \napart and bricks and glass are everywhere. The cross from around PAUL's \nneck is buried in the debris. Sirens are heard in the distance. A BLACK \nCAR speeds off down the street. JACOB looks for the YOUNG MAN who had \nhelped him. He is gone.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  FUNERAL PROCESSION - DAY\n</b>\nA FUNERAL PROCESSION heads down Ocean Parkway.\n\n\n<b>INT.  JACOB'S CAR - DAY\n</b>\nJACOB and JEZZIE are driving in an old Chevy Nova. They are dressed up. \nJACOB's face is bruised and he has a gauze pad over his ear. They drive \nin silence. JACOB appears very sad. Slowly his right hand reaches \nacross the seat, seeking JEZZIE's. Their fingers embrace.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  CEMETERY - DAY\n</b>\nThe FUNERAL PROCESSION enters the CEMETERY. Cars park along the length \nof the narrow road. MEN IN DARK SUITS emerge from their cars along with \nWIVES and GIRLFRIENDS.\n\nThey are the SOLDIERS we have seen at the opening of the film, only \nthey are older now. A small group of FAMILY MEMBERS are helped to the \ngraveside.\n\nJACOB joins the other VETERANS as pallbearers. They carry the casket in \nsemi-military formation to the grave.\n\n\n<b>INT.  PAUL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY\n</b>\nJACOB'S OLD ARMY BUDDIES are sitting together in Paul's living room, \ntalking. PAUL'S WIFE can be seen in the BEDROOM. Several WOMEN are \ncomforting her.\n\nJEZZIE is talking to a small group of LADIES in the DINING ROOM and \nnibbling off a tray of cold cuts. PAUL'S SISTER is with her and they \nseem to be having a lively, almost intimate, conversation.\n\nJACOB and his BUDDIES are drinking beer. They all have a tired, \ndefeated look about them.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\tDid anyone see the police report? It\n\t\tsounds like a detonation job to me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJERRY\n</b>\t\tThe paper said it was electrical; a\n\t\tfreak accident.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROD\n</b>\t\tBullshit.

There is immediate \nsilence and eyes averted from one another.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROD\n</b>\t\tWhat'd he say that for? What made him\n\t\tsay that? Strange, huh? Strange.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n</b>\t\tWhat else did he say, Jake?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tHe was scared. He saw these creatures\n\t\tcoming out of the woodwork.

I hope you can\n\t\thold your dick better than you hold\n\t\tthat can.\n\nNo one laughs. There is an uncomfortable silence.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  A BACK ALLEY - DAY\n</b>\nThe SIX MEN are walking quietly through an unpaved alley. It is already \ngray and getting darker.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDOUG\n</b>\t\tI know what Paul was talking about.

GEARY, a red-faced man with three \nchins, is sucking on an ice cube. He looks at each of the men, and then \nspits the ice cube into an empty glass. It clinks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEARY\n</b>\t\tI'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you\n\t\thave any idea how many people come to\n\t\tme with the injustices of the world?\n\t\tIt'd break your heart.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tThis isn't injustice, Mr. Geary.

What am I - Perry Mason\n\t\there?\n\nGEARY stands up and grabs a bag of Cheetos from a file drawer. He \nchomps down a few and offers the bag to the others. There are no \ntakers. Thirsty, he downs the ice cube and cracks it between his teeth.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEARY\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tOkay. I'll look into it.\n\nThe MEN are surprised and excited.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAUL\n</b>\t\tWow!

They are jubilant, \nclasping hands and smacking each other on the back. We watch as they \nbreak up. JACOB heads for the subway. FRANK and another group hop a \ncab. As the cab pulls away we notice that a black car pulls out behind \nit. It follows them out of sight.\n\n\n<b>INT.  JACOB'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n</b>\nJACOB and JEZZIE are making wild and unadulterated love on the kitchen \nfloor. The wastebasket flips over. JACOB's hand splashes into the dog's \nbowl. Nothing impedes their passion. JEZZIE laughs, hollers, and \nswoons. Hands grab hold of table legs. Chairs topple. Feet bang wildly \nagainst the stove. It is all mayhem and ecstacy. And then it ends.\n\nJACOB's face is ecstatic. He can barely talk and simply basks in \nJEZZIE's glow. She looks especially lovely and radiant. They lie \nexhausted and exhilarated on the linoleum floor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tSo tell me ... am I still an angel?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(smiling broadly)\n\t\tWith wings.

I'll\n\t\ttell you something, Jez, honestly\n\t\t... I thought they were real.\n\nSilence. Suddenly JEZZIE roars like a monster and scares JACOB half to \ndeath. They laugh and tumble back to the floor.\n\n\n<b>INT.  JACOB'S APT. - EVENING\n</b>\nJACOB emerges from the bathroom shower and pulls on a robe.

Beneath his discharge papers he finds a sheet \nscribbled with the names and addresses of platoon buddies. JACOB grabs \nit. Then his eyes fall on the frayed remains of an old letter. He picks \nit up and unfolds it with great care. The letter is written in a \nchild's handwriting. \"DEAR DADDY, I LOVE YOU. PLEASE COME HOME. JED GOT \n<b>A FROG. ELI LOST MY KEY.

After a couple of \nfalse starts, JACOB lets go and GABE is riding by himself. For an \ninstant, GABE looks back at his father with a huge grin on his face. \nJACOB is grinning, too.

Something in the mirror, like the image of a \nchild, seems to move. He looks over. There is nothing there. Curious, \nJACOB walks toward the mirror. As his image appears, he gasps and stops \nmoving. To his horror and ours, it is his own back that is reflected in \nthe mirror. The impossibility of the moment startles him. He lifts his \nhand. The reflection moves with him. Frightened but defiant, JACOB \nmoves toward the mirror. The image in the mirror spins around. It is \nthe  FRIGHTENING VIBRATING FACE he saw at the party with JEZZIE. An \nunearthly scream comes from both their mouths.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b><b>\t\tNO!!!\n</b>\n\n<b>INT.  BROOKLYN COURT HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\nA huge wooden door slams open. JACOB charges through it.\n\nHe is chasing his lawyer, DONALD GEARY, through a crowded court house \ncorridor. GEARY, sweaty and unshaven, is cradling a Coke in one hand, a \nsandwich and a briefcase in the other. His stomach bounces wildly as he \nwalks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tGeary! Mr. Geary!

JACOB stands there a moment, and then rushes \nafter him. GEARY is biting into his sandwich.\n\nMayonnaise spills onto his hand. He licks it with his tongue. JACOB \ncatches up to him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEARY\n</b>\t\tYou mind? I'm eating, huh?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tSomething's going on here. You're not\n\t\ttelling me something.

JACOB, enraged, \ncharges after him. With a wild swipe he sends the COKE CAN shooting out \nof GEARY's hand. It reverberates down the corridor. GEARY is stunned.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tYou slimy bastard! You goddamn piece\n\t\tof shit!\n\nWith a powerful thrust, JACOB rips the sandwich from GEARY's other \nhand. Tossing it on the floor, he grinds his heel in it. Tomato and \nmayonnaise squirt onto GEARY's shoe. JACOB turns away.\n\n\nCUT TO JACOB walking down the COURT HOUSE CORRIDOR to the elevators. \nThere is a look of satisfaction on his face.\n\n\nCUT BACK TO GEARY. He picks up a telephone and dials. Someone comes on \nthe line. GEARY speaks quietly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEARY\n</b>\t\tHe's on his way.\n\nCUT TO JACOB stepping onto the elevator. The doors close. The Muzak is \nplaying \"Sonny Boy\" with Al Jolson singing. JACOB is surprised to hear \nit. He presses the down button for the main floor.\n\n\nThe elevator stops at the LOBBY. The doors open swiftly. SEVERAL \nSOLDIERS are standing there. They approach JACOB.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER 1\n</b>\t\tLet's go, Singer.\n\nJACOB is shocked to see them. He tries to get away but two of the \nSOLDIERS yank him toward the LOBBY doors.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLDIER 2\n</b>\t\tYou're coming with us.\n\n\n<b>INT.  CAR - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\nJACOB is hustled to a waiting car and shoved inside, in between two \nofficious looking MEN.

He \nis totally out of control.\n\nWith a wild leap, he grabs for the door handle. The door flies open. It \nflaps back and forth, slamming into parked cars. JACOB tries to jump \nout, but the men yank him back in. One of them pulls out a gun. JACOB \nsees it and goes crazy. His feet kick in all directions, slamming the \nDRIVER's nose into the steering wheel and shattering the side window.\n\nThe car careens around a corner sending the gun flying to the floor. \nThe men dive for it. It lodges beneath the seat. In the mayhem, JACOB \nthrows himself out of the flapping door and sprawls onto the pavement. \nPeople look down at him as the car speeds away.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  BROOKLYN - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\nJACOB grabs his back. He is in excruciating pain. He tries to get up, \nbut can't move. He reaches out to people passing by, but they ignore \nhim and hurry past.\n\nA SALVATION ARMY SANTA has been watching the entire scene. After a \nmoment's consideration he leaves his post and ambles over to JACOB. He \nleans down and steals his wallet.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSANTA\n</b>\t\tMerry Christmas.\n\n\n<b>EXT.

CORRIDORS - NIGHT\n</b>\nJACOB begins a journey down what appears to be an endless series of \ncorridors. The wheels of the gurney turn with a hypnotic regularity. \nThe smooth tile floor gives way to roguh cement. The ORDERLY's feet \nplod through pools of blood that coagulate in cracks and crevices along \nthe way. The surface grows rougher, the wheels more insistent. Body \nparts and human bile splash against the walls as the gurney moves \nfaster.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWhere are you taking me? Where am I?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tORDERLY\n</b>\t\tYou know where you are.\n\nJACOB, panicked, tries again to get up but to no effect. He glances to \nthe side and sees mournful CREATURES being led into dark rooms. No one \nfights or struggles. We hear muffled screams from behind closed doors. \nOccasionally he glances inside the rooms and sees mangled bodies in \nstrange contraptions, people in rusty iron lungs, and hanging from \nmetal cages. Dark eyes peer out in horror. In one room a baseboard \nheater bursts into flame. No one seems concerned. A door opens. A \nbicycle with plastic streamers on the handlebars lies crushed and \nmangled. One of its wheels is still spinning. JACOB cries out but it is \nnot his voice we hear. Rather it is a familiar unearthly roar. His \nwhole body stiffens. As he rounds the corner he sees a figure, its head \nvibrating in endless terror. it is the same image he has seen before. \nJACOB screams.\n\n\n<b>INT.  ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nJACOB is wheeled into a tiny ROOM. A numer of \"DOCTORS\" are waiting. As \nthey draw closer JACOB notices that something about them is not right. \nThey bear a subtle resemblance to Bosch-like DEMONS, creatures of \nanother world. JACOB tries to sit up but winces in pain. He cannot \nmove. He tries to scream but no sound comes out.\n\nChains and pulleys hang from the ceiling. They are lowered and attached \nwith speed and efficiency to JACOB's arms and legs. He screams.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tOh God!\n\nThe \"DOCTORS\" laugh. There is the sound of a huge door closing. JACOB \nis left in semi-darkness. Suddenly a new group of \"DOCTORS\" emerges \nfrom the shadows. They are carrying sharp surgical instruments. They \nsurround JACOB, their eyes glistening as bright as their blades. JACOB \nis panting and sweating in fear. One of the \"DOCTORS\" leans over JACOB. \nHe gasps with horror. It is JEZZIE.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b><b>\t\tJEZZIE!\n</b>\nShe pays no attention to him. He stares at her, THE CAMERA TILTING DOWN \nHER BODY. As it gets to her foot we see it is a decaying mass, swarming \nwith maggots. The \"DOCTORS\" laugh. They take great pleasure in his \nsuffering. Their voices are strange and not human. Each utterance \ncontains a multitude of contradictory tones, sincere and compassionate, \ntaunting and mocking at the same time. The confusion of meanings is a \ntorment of its own.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tGet me out of here.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\"DOCTOR\"\n</b>\t\tWhere do you want to go?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tTake me home.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\"DOCTOR\"\n</b>\t\tHome?\n\t\t\t(they all laugh)\n\t\tThis is your home.

You've been\n\t\tkilled. Don't you remember?\n\nA \"DOCTOR\" approaches JACOB. As he turns, we notice with horror that he \nhas no eyes or eye sockets. He extracts a long needle from his belt and \npositions it over JACOB's head. Like a divining rod it locates a \nparticular point near the crown of his head. With a powerful thrust the \n\"DOCTOR\" shoves the needle into JACOB's skull and pushes it slowly into \nhis brain. JACOB howls.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT\n</b>\nCUT RAPIDLY TO VIETNAM and a replay of flashes of the opening sequence \nof the film. SOLDIERS with bayonets are charging over rice paddies in \nthe dark of the night.

LOUIS shakes his head in dismay.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tThe other \"right,\" okay?\n\t\t\t(he helps JACOB turn\n\t\t\tover)\n\t\tYou're a regular basket case, you\n\t\tknow that?\n\t\t\t(he moves JACOB's arm\n\t\t\tover his head)\n\t\tEckart saw Hell, too.\n\nLOUIS positions JACOB's other arm, bends his legs, and then pushes down \non his thigh. His spine moves with a cracking sound. JACOB groans.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tYou know what he said? The only thing\n\t\tthat burns in Hell is the part of you\n\t\tthat won't let go of your life; your\n\t\tmemories, your attachments. They burn\n\t\t'em all away. But they're not punish-\n\t\ting you, he said. They're freeing\n\t\tyour soul. Okay, other side.\n\nHe helps JACOB and repositions him. Again he pushes and the spine \ncracks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWonderful. So the way he sees it, if\n\t\tyou're frightened of dying and hold-\n\t\ting on, you'll see devils tearing\n\t\tyour life away. But if you've made\n\t\tyour peace then the devils are really\n\t\tangels freeing you from the earth.\n\t\tIt's just a matter of how you look at\n\t\tit, that's all. So don't worry, okay?\n\t\tRelax. Wiggle your toes.\n\nJACOB's toes dance as LOUIS gives him a quick, unexpected jab to the \nlower vertebrae in his back.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tPerfect.

By myself?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tYou can do it. Come on. Easy. Just\n\t\tgive it a try.\n\nJACOB steps cautiously away from the table. He moves hesitantly, with \ndeliberate restraint. LOUIS encourages him like a faith healer coaxing \nthe lame. His first steps have an aura of the miraculous about them. \nJACOB walks slowly, without help. LOUIS smiles impishly. He looks like \na giant cherub.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tHallelujah.\n\nLOUIS puts his arm around him. Then JACOB tries again, gradually \nrediscovering his balance and strength. With each step his confidence \nreturns. LOUIS is pleased. Then, suddenly, without warning, JACOB turns \nand heads toward the door.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tWhat are you doing?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tThere's something I've gotta take\n\t\tcare of, Louis.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tWhat are you talking about?

No more rest.\n\nHe walks slowly out the door. LOUIS starts to go after him. JACOB turns \naround and shakes his head \"no.\" The look on his face is firm and \ndefiant. LOUIS stands back and lets him go.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI love you, Louis.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  U.S. ARMY RECRUITING HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT\n</b>\nCUT TO A SDIREN BLARING and a fire engine racing through the streets of \nlower MANHATTAN. A CROWD is forming. Banks of lights and television \ncameras amass in the cold night air. Police cars and mobile units rush \nto the scene.\n\nCUT TO JACOB. In one hand he is holding a brightly lit torch. In the \nother he is holding a container of gasoline and pouring it on the steps \nof the U.S. ARMY RECRUITING HEADQUARTERS. The volatile liquid splashes \nagainst his pants and shoes and runs down the pavement. A five gallon \ncontainer lies emptying nearby. Gasoline belches from it insistently \nand pours onto the street. Bystanders back away as the gasoline snakes \ntoward them.\n\nTelevision cameras and microphones are pointing in JACOB's direction, \nbut at a safe distance. He is yelling at them, his teeth chattering \nfrom the cold.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tListen to me. There were four\n\t\tcompanies in our batallion. Five\n\t\thundred men.

JACOB is enraged. \nHe brandishes the torch at the crowd.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWhat the fuck do you think you're\n\t\tdoing?\n\nAnother match hurls toward him and dies in mid-air. PEOPLE on the \nfringe of the crowd begin to run. JACOB does not move.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE\n</b>\t\tClear the area. This is an order!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWhat is wrong with you?\n\nWe hear laughter from PEOPLE in the crowd. As JACOB looks out into some \nof their eyes he sees demons looking back. One of them throws another \nmatch. Crazed, JACOB runs toward them. PEOPLE jump back.\n\nSuddenly JACOB freezes. Standing on the sidelines, he sees one of the \nARMY OFFICIALS who trapped him in the car. He is reaching for a gun. \nJACOB, stunned, yells at the top of hhis lungs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b><b>\t\tNO!\n</b>\nWith a defiant roar, he hurls the torch straight up into the air. We \nsee it from high above the crowd spinning higher and higher. All eyes \nstare upward watching it in a kind of wonder. Then, reaching its apex, \njust below the camera, it begins its descent. The eyes of the crowd \nturn to fear. SOMEONE yells.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tONLOOKER\n</b>\t\tHe'll burn us all!\n\nScreams fill the air as PEOPLE scramble to escape the potential \nconflagration. Only JACOB remains motionless, standing silently, almost \nheroically, in the middle of it all.\n\nSuddenly the torch hits the ground and a pool of gasoline ignites with \na blinding flare that sends flames shooting in all directions. PEOPLE \npanic. T.V. REPORTERS and CAMERAMEN run for their lives. The ARMY \nOFFICIALS run, too. The flames travel toward the Army Headquarters and \nrush along the curb. Water hoses are trying to douse them as they \nspread. JACOB, surprisingly untouched by the fire, walks slowly through \nthe frightened crowds, as if in a daze. Viewed through the flames the \nscene momentarily resembles a vision of Hell.\n\n\n<b>INT.  JACOB'S APT. - NIGHT\n</b>\nJACOB, stark naked and covered with goose bumps, runs his hands under a \nshower spray. The water is freezing and taking forever to warm up. \nAnxious, he dashes past his gasoline drenched clothes, grabs a suitcase \nfrom the BEDROOM closet, and stuffs it with clothes. Then he hurries \nback to the shower, tests it, and jumps in.\n\nLather covers JACOB's hair and hangs over his tightly closed eyes. His \nentire body is covered in suds. He is washing as quickly as he can. \nSuddenly he hears a noise as someone enters the BATHROOM. He tenses.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWho's there? Who is it?\n\nJACOB struggles to rinse the soap from his eyes. They are burning. \nThere is a shadow behind the curtain.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tGoddamn it! Who's there?\n\nJACOB rubs his eyes, fighting to see. Suddenly the shower curtain is \nthrown back. JACOB backs against the wall. A hand reaches in and pulls \nhis nipple, pinching hard.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tIt's just me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tJezzie?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tWho else were you expecting?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tLet go!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tWhere were you, Jake?

Turn on the T.V.\n\t\tWatch the fucking news!\n\nHe pushes her away and jumps out of the shower.\n\nCUT TO JACOB dressing and piling the last of his clothes into his \nsuitcase. JEZZIE, in a robe, is watching him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tWhy are you doing this to me?

JACOB's image can be seen on the screen. We \nhear the NEWSCASTER speaking.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNEWSCASTER\n</b>\t\tLeading the news tonight, a bizarre\n\t\tdemonstration on the steps of the\n\t\tU.S. Army Recruiting Headquarters, in\n\t\tdowntown Manhattan.

JACOB takes his suitcase and \nhurries to the front door. He opens it a crack and peers into the \nhallway. JEZZIE runs after him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\t\t(almost threatening)\n\t\tDon't leave me, Jake.\n\n\n<b>INT.

JACOB just stares at her for a moment and then \ndisappears down the stairwell.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\nJACOB is standing near the WESTSIDE HIGHWAY. GROUPS OF MEN in black \nleather jackets are crusing the area and look at JACOB with curiosity. \nOne MAN in particular cruises by several times and then approaches him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tJacob? Hi. I'm Michael Newman.\n\t\tFriends call me Mike.\n\nJACOB is startled when he sees him.

JACOB is wide-eyed as he listens to MICHAEL's \nstory.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tSo first I'm arrested, right? Best\n\t\tLSD I ever made, right down the\n\t\tdrain.

They had us isolating\n\t\tspecial properties. The dark side,\n\t\tyou know? They wanted a drug that\n\t\tincreased aggressive tendencies.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tYeah, sure. We were losing the war.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tRight. They were worried. They\n\t\tfigured you guys were too soft. They\n\t\twanted something to stir you up, tap\n\t\tinto your anger, you know? And we did\n\t\tit. The most powerful thing I ever\n\t\tsaw. Even a bad trip, and I had my\n\t\tshare, never compared to the fury of\n\t\tthe Ladder.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tThe Ladder?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tThat's what they called it.

But not with the Cong.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWho then?\n\nHe hesitates, obviously uncomfortable. His eyes grow puffy. He looks at \nthe river for a moment and then turns to JACOB.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tYou killed each other.\n\nJACOB's mouth drops open. The words hit him like a truck.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT\n</b>\nGunfire explodes in the darkening sky. We are in Vietnam. JACOB is at \nthe bottom of a trench fighting with FRANK. Chaos surrounds them. Men \nare screaming. The ENEMY is storming at them from the rear. ROD raises \nhis bayonet and jams it into the belly of his ATTACKER. It is only \nafter a series of jabs that he sees it's another American he's killed. \nROD's eyes go blank with confusion and terror.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROD\n</b>\t\tOh my God! WHAT'S HAPPENING?\n\nJACOB looks up from the trench and sees a continuing wave of AMERICAN \nSOLDIERS bearing down on them. FRANK jumps up, knocking JACOB to the \nground and slamming his rifle into JACOB's back. As he spins around \nJACOB sees another SOLDIER charging at him. His bayonet is aimed at \nJACOB's stomach. For the first time JACOB remembers the face of his \nattacker. He is a YOUNG MAN, about 19 years old, clean cut, wearing \nglasses. The two men stare at each other in terrible confusion. It \nseems like a moment out of time. And then the SOLDIER lurches forward \nand rams his bayonet deep into JACOB's abdomen.\n\nCUT TO MICHAEL BACK ON THE PIER. JACOB is ashen-faced.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tIt was brother against brother. No\n\t\tdiscrimination. You tore each other\n\t\tto pieces. I knew it would happen. I\n\t\twarned them.

He wipes them with his sleeve. \nIt takes him a moment to regain his composure. JACOB is shivering. \nMICHAEL takes off his jacket, drapes it over JACOB, and leads him to \nthe wooden planks overhanging the water. They sit and gaze at the \n<b>JERSEY SHORE.\n</b>\n\nCUT TO A WIDE SHOT OF MICHAEL AND JACOB in pre-dawn light.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tI always suspected the effects might\n\t\tcome back.

You've got\n\t\tbigger problems than me.\n\nMICHAEL reaches into his pocket and casually extracts a vial.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tI came up with the formula back in\n\t\tNam but I never got a chance to use\n\t\tit.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tNever?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tI'd hoped I'd never have to. Just\n\t\topen your mouth and stick out your\n\t\ttongue.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWhat is it?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tDon't worry. Take it. It'll free your\n\t\thead. Come on.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(fearful)\n\t\tI don't know.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\t\"Yea though I walk through the valley\n\t\tof the shadow of death I shall fear\n\t\tno evil,\" but no one ever said I\n\t\twouldn't be shittin' in my pants\n\t\tevery step of the way, huh?\n\t\t\t(JACOB smiles, his mouth\n\t\t\topen)\n\t\tStick out your tongue.\n\t\t\t(JACOB obeys as an\n\t\t\teyedropper deposits a\n\t\t\tdrop of liquid on the\n\t\t\tback of his tongue)\n\t\tThat'a boy. Now why don't you just\n\t\tlie down and relax.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tOne drop?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tIt's strong stuff.\n\nJACOB stretches out on the bed. He stares up at the ceiling and \nexamines its pock-marked lunar look. Long cracks and shallow craters \nerode the surface. It is an alien terrain.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI think I'm falling asleep.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tPleasant dreams.\n\nThe words send a jolt through JACOB's body. He tries to get up but \ncan't. He's frightened.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI can't move.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tJust relax.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWhat's happening? Help me.\n\nThe ceiling begins to rumble. Cracks split wide open. Huge crevasses \ntear through the plaster. JACOB's world is crumbling. He stares in \nhorror as DEMONIC FORMS attempt to surge through the rupture above him. \nPiercing eyes and sharp teeth glimmer in the darkness. Hooved feet and \npointed claws clamor to break through.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n<b>\t\tHELP ME!\n</b>\nInstantly MICHAEL appears standing over him. He is holding the vial \nwith the antidote. He draws an eyedropper full of the fluid and holds \nit over JACOB's mouth.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tTake it!\n\nJACOB fights him, but MICHAEL forces the entire contents of the \neyedropper down his throat. JACOB gags. He tries to spit it out, but \ncan't.\n\nSuddenly the ceiling erupts in violent clashes as whole chunks break \noff and collide like continental plates. The collisons wreak havoc on \nthe DEMONS, chopping and dismembering them. Body parts fall from the \nceiling like a Devil's rain. Horrible screams echo from the other side.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tDon't fight it. It's your own mind.\n\t\tIt's your own fears.\n\nFlashes of light and dark storm over JACOB's head, thundering like a \nwar in the heavens. It is a scene of raw power and growing catastrophe. \nIt builds in fury and rage until suddenly the ceiling explodes. JACOB's \neyes stare into the formlessness expanding around him. All space is \nbecoming a dark liquid void.\n\nGradually the liquid grows bluer, clearer. There is an undulating sense \nto the imagery, a feeling of womb-like comfort. Strange lights appear \nand sparkle before us like sunlight on the ocean. JACOB is rushing \nupward, toward the surface.\n\nWith the delirious sound of water giving way to air, JACOB breaks \nthrough. To his amazement, he finds himself floating out-stretched on \nshimmering sunlit water. Above him are clouds of such wondrous beauty \nthat they cannot possibly be of the earth. Pillars of golden light \nreach down from the heavens creating a cathedral of light. It is a \nvision of heaven, a vast, almost mythic paradise. JACOB is awed.\n\nA sudden movement catches his attention. He looks over and sees MICHAEL \nstanding before him. Only MICHAEL looks different. His face seems to \nradiate an inner light, a transcendental beauty. JACOB is nearly \nblinded by his presence and must shield his eyes to look at him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tSo, how you doin'?\n\nThe casualness of the words catches JACOB by surprise. He sits up. To \nhis shock and amazement, he finds that he is back in THE HOTEL ROOM. \nMICHAEL is standing at the foot of the bed. JACOB is totally \ndisoriented. His eyes move slowly around the room, taking everything \nin. He doesn't speak.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tIt was better than you expected, huh?\n\nJACOB just stares at him for a while and then suddenly begins to laugh. \nIt is a huge laugh, full of energy and life.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tAnd no more demons. I told you they'd\n\t\tbe gone.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI don't believe this. It's a miracle,\n\t\tMichael. A miracle.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tBetter living through chemistry,\n\t\tthat's my motto.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  GREENWICH VILLAGE - DAY\n</b>\nJACOB and MICHAEL are walking through the STREETS OF GREENWICH VILLAGE. \nIt is early MORNING and the sidewalks are bustling with PEOPLE. JACOB \nstares into their faces and beams when they smile back. MICHAEL enjoys \nJACOB's happiness.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  WASHINGTON SQUARE - DAY\n</b>\nJACOB and MICHAEL walk through WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tIt was paradise, Michael. You showed\n\t\tit to me. You were there.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tWell that's good to know.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tMike, it was real. It was glorious.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tGlorious. I'm not surprised. I fed\n\t\tyou enough of that stuff to send a\n\t\thorse to heaven. I'm just glad you\n\t\tcame back.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI would have stayed there if I could.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tI'm sure. You've got nothing but\n\t\ttroubles waitin' for you here.\n\nHe points to two POLICEMEN on the far side of the SQUARE.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\t\t(taking JACOB's arm)\n\t\tCome on.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  GRAMERCY PARK HOTEL - DAY\n</b>\nThe TWO MEN head up to GRAMERCY PARK and stop in front of the GRAMERCY \nPARK HOTEL. Reaching into his wallet, MICHAEL pulls out a huge stack of \ncredit cards and hands one to JACOB.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tHere. I've got every credit card ever\n\t\tprinted. Take this. Stay here till\n\t\tyou can arrange to get away. It's on\n\t\tme.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tNo. I couldn't.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tWhat? You want the Plaza? Don't be\n\t\tfoolish. Here. Take this, too.\n\t\t\t(he pulls out a business\n\t\t\tcard)\n\t\tThis is my place on Prince Street.\n\t\tIt's got my phone, everything. Call\n\t\tif you need me ... but you won't.\n\t\tEverything's gonna work out. You just\n\t\tget outta town as fast as you can.\n\t\tThe New York police can be effective\n\t\twhen they want to be.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI don't know what to say.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tSave the words ... Just send back my\n\t\tcredit card.\n\nMICHAEL laughs, hugs JACOB, and walks away.\n\n\n<b>INT.  HOTEL ROOM - DAY\n</b>\nJACOB is in a lovely MOTEL ROOM overlooking GRAMERCY SQUARE. He is \nsprawled out happily on the bed when there is a knock at the door. He \njumps up and opens it. JEZZIE is standing there. She looks at JACOB \nquizzically. He smiles and takes her in his arms, swinging her into the \nroom.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tWhat are you doing here? Are you all\n\t\tright? How do you expect to pay for\n\t\tthis?\n\t\t\t(JACOB smiles)\n\t\tEveryone's looking for you, Jake. I\n\t\tdodged people all over the place,\n\t\treporters, police. I don't know what\n\t\tyou're gonna do.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI'm gonna make love to you. That's\n\t\twhat I'm gonna do.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tAre you out of your mind?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tYep. Finally.

For \nall his ardor JACOB is exhausted from the events of the preceding day. \nWhile stroking JEZZIE's hair he begins to fall asleep. JEZZIE crawls on \ntop of him and shoves her hand down his pants. JACOB smiles.\n\nDISSOLVE TO JACOB and JEZZIE making love.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTIME CUT:\n</b>\n\nDISSOLVE TO JACOB and JEZZIE lying in front of the T.V. watching a \nromantic movie. JEZZIE snuggles up to JACOB.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tIt's amazing, you know, that a drug\n\t\tcould change things like that,\n\t\tdestroy a life and then give it back.\n\t\tIt's hard to believe that the world\n\t\tcould be so hellish on day and like\n\t\theaven the next.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI tell you, it was so wonderful. I\n\t\tfelt like a little boy. I saw\n\t\tParadise, Jezzie.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tIt's so hard to believe.\n\nThere is a knock at the door. JACOB throws on a bathrobe. JEZZIE jumps \nunder the sheets.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWho's there?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBELLBOY (V.O.)\n</b>\t\tIt's your dinner, sir.\n\nJEZZIE's eyes brighten. JACOB opens the door. A BELLBOY wheels in a \ntable set for dinner. He sets it in a corner of the room. JEZZIE jumps \nout of bed, runs to the table, sniffs at the food, and squeals \nexcitedly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tThis is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever\n\t\tsince I was a little girl. I never\n\t\tthought it would happen.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tStick with me, kid.\n\nJEZZIE smiles.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTIME CUT:\n</b>\n\nDISSOLVE to JACOB and JEZZIE sitting next to a large window overlooking \nGRAMERCY PARK. They are sipping champagne.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tI want to go with you, Jake. Wherever\n\t\tyou go.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tIt's not practical, Jez.

I'm the\n\t\tonly one left. I don't want to expose\n\t\tyou to that. It's not right for you\n\t\tor me. Be reasonable.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tReasonable? Reasonable? Jake ...\n\t\tYou're gettin' me angry.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI love you when you're angry.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tOh yeah?\n\t\t\t(her eyes twinkle\n\t\t\tsuggestively)\n\t\tTry leavin' without me.\n\nJACOB laughs. JEZZIE doesn't. Unexpectedly she grabs JACOB and pushes \nhim onto the bed. In seconds they are all over each other, their \nclothes flying in all directions. They seem as happy as could be.\n\n\n<b>OMIT\n</b>\n\n<b>INT.  GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY\n</b>\nJACOB enters GRAND CENTRAL STATION. He checks out all the PEOPLE around \nhim. Not a DEMON in sight. Hurrying to the TICKET WINDOW he gets in \nline. The TICKET SELLER looks up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tChicago. One way. For tomorrow.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSELLER\n</b>\t\tHow many?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tOne.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSELLER\n</b>\t\tThat'll be $119.75.\n\nJACOB pulls out MICHAEL's credit card. The SELLER rings it up. While he \nis waiting JACOB notices a POLICEMAN looking at him. The stare \nunsettles him. The SELLER hands JACOB his ticket. He takes it and \nhurries into the CROWD. Looking back he notices the POLICEMAN is \nfollowing him.\n\n\n<b>INT.  MEN'S ROOM - DAY\n</b>\nJACOB enters the MEN'S ROOM. He hurries into one of the stalsls, drops \nhis pants, and sits. He eyes the graffiti on the walls and then notices \na wad of tissue stuffed into a hole between him and the next stall. It \nis moving. Suddenly the tissue falls to the floor. JACOB glances at the \nhole curiously and leans forward to examine it. He is shocked to see an \neye staring back at him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tGoddamn it!\n\t\t\t(he covers it with his\n\t\t\thand. A pencil jabs his\n\t\t\tpalm. He yells)\n\t\tFucking pervert.\n\nTwo lips form around the hole. A tongue wags obscenely.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE\n</b>\t\tDream on!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(shocked)\n\t\tWhat?!\n\nThe mouth is gone. JACOB hears the stall door fly open and feet running \nfrom the room. He jumps up and grabs his pants. He dashes out of the \nMEN'S ROOM. He hears footsteps and chases after them.\n\n\n<b>INT.  GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY\n</b>\nJACOB bursts into the MAIN TERMINAL. He sees someone rushing toward the \nmain doors and speeds after him. HOMELESS PEOPLE, huddling along the \ncorridors, watch as they run past. Escaping to the street, the MAN \ndisappears in the holiday throngs. JACOB, crazed, stands gasping for \nbreath. His fists dig into his coat pocket. Suddenly he feels something \nand seems surprised when MICHAEL's CARD emerges in his hands.\n\n\n<b>OMIT\n</b>\n\n<b>INT.  SOHO LOFT BUILDING - EVENING\n</b>\nJACOB runs up the stairs in a SOHO LOFT BUILDING. It is a dingy, \nindustrial staircase, poorly lit. He reaches a door with MICHAEL's name \npainted on it in large black letters. He knocks loudly. There is no \nanswer. He pounds on it. Another door opens on the floor above. A head \nsticks out.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAN\n</b>\t\tYou lookin' for Mike?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(panting hard)\n\t\tWhere is he?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAN\n</b>\t\tDon't know. Hasn't picked his mail up\n\t\tin days. It's not like him.\n\nJACOB has a frenzied look in his eyes. He searches around the staircase \nand sees a pile of lumber stacked in a corner. He grabs a two-by-four \nand lunges at the door.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAN\n</b>\t\tWhat the hell are you doing?\n\nJACOB doesn't answer. He smashes wildly at the door until the lock \nflies open.\n\n\n<b>INT.  MICHAEL'S LOFT - EVENING\n</b>\nJACOB charges into the dark space groping for a light. He finds it. The \nLOFT is a disaster area. Nothing is standing. JACOB runs from room to \nroom. In the back he discovers a large private chemistry lab. Glass \nvials and bottles are shattered on the floor.\n\nJACOB rifles through the cabinets. A few bottles are intact but their \nlabels mean nothing to him.\n\nHe reaches for one cabinet and notices a reddish liquid oozing out from \nthe bottom. He opens it. MICHAEL's severed head stares him in the face. \nIt is smiling.\n\nA scream rings out as the MAN from upstairs sees what JACOB has seen. \nJACOB jumps back, trips, and falls over MICHAEL's headless body. It is \nlying sprawled across the floor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAN\n</b>\t\tOh my God!\n\nJACOB stumbles to pull himself up. He is in a state of unrelieved \npanic. He runs past the MAN and spills out the doorr. He takes two and \nthree stairs at a time, nearly flying to the street.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  SOHO STREETS - NIGHT\n</b>\nJACOB rushes into the icy air and runs wildly down the sidewalk as fast \nas his legs will move. With unexpected violence he charges into the \nside of a building. Over and over he hurls himself against it. He grabs \nfor the bricks. His fingers insert themselves into the crevices. It is \nas though he is trying to merge with the wall.\n\nSuddenly JACOB turns and dashes into the street. A taxi is speeding \ntoward him, its lights the only sign of life and warmth in the dark \nnight. JACOB steps into its path. It is hard to tell if he is trying to \nstop the cab or waiting to be hit. The taxi screeches to a halt. JACOB \nstares at it a moment and then steps to get in. The DRIVER tries to \npull off but JACOB yanks at the door and drags himself inside.\n\n\n<b>INT.  TAXI - NIGHT\n</b>\nRain is beginning to fall. It streaks the windows.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(barely audible)\n\t\tI'm going to Brooklyn.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDRIVER\n</b>\t\tSorry, Mac. Not with me you're not. I\n\t\tget lost in Brooklyn.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI know the way.\n\nJACOB reaches into his pants pocket, pulls out a twenty dollar bill, \nand hands it to the DRIVER. He takes it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tLook, this is all the money I've got\n\t\tin the world. Take me home and it's\n\t\tyours.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDRIVER\n</b>\t\t... Where's your home?\n\nCUT TO THE TAXI heading down WEST BROADWAY, approaching the BROOKLYN \nBRIDGE, crossing the EAST RIVER, and driving through dark BROOKLYN \n<b>STREETS.\n</b>\nJACOB's face passes in and out of dense shadows. Every time he is \nbathed in light his image seems to alter. Something in him is falling \naway.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  SARAH'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\n</b>\nJACOB gets out of the TAXI and approaches the LOBBY of SARAH'S \nAPARTMENT BUILDING. JACOB is greeted by the DOORMAN.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDOORMAN\n</b>\t\tDr. Singer. It's been a long time.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(greeting him warmly)\n\t\tHello, Sam.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDOORMAN\n</b>\t\t\t(noticing JACOB's\n\t\t\tbattered condition)\n\t\tAre you all right?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI'm okay.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDOORMAN\n</b>\t\tDo you want some help? I can call\n\t\tupstairs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tNo, don't. But thanks.\n\n\n<b>INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\nJACOB stops in front of the APARTMENT door and reaches his hand \nunderneath a section of the hallway carpet. It comes back with a key. \nHe inserts it into the lock and gently opens the door. He calls out.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tHello. It's me.\n\n\n<b>INT.  SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n</b>\nSome lights are on. The APARTMENT looks comfortable and cozy.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tHello? Is anybody home? Jed? Eli?\n\t\tDaddy's here.\n\nThere is still no answer. JACOB is surprised. He peers into the dark \nLIVING ROOM and then walks to the KITCHEN. No one is around. A photo of \nJACOB, SARAH, AND THEIR BOYS is sitting on the counter. He picks it up \nand carries it with him through the apartment. He walks into his old \nBEDROOM and then into the BOYS' ROOM. The beds are still unmade. There \nis no one home. He sees his image in the BATHROOM mirror and turns away \nin disgust. He walks back to the LIVING ROOM. He is about to switch the \nlights on when he hears footsteps coming down the hall. He calls out.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tSarah, is that you? I hope you don't\n\t\tmind. I needed to come home.\n\nJACOB is startled to see JEZZIE enter the room. She does not seem he \nusual self. She appears larger, more imposing.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tHello, Jake. I knew you'd come here\n\t\tin the end.\n\nJACOB is nervous.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWhat're you ... ? Where's Sarah?\n\t\tWhere are the boys?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tSit down, Jake.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWhere are they?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tSit down.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tNo!

Stop playing with yourself.\n\t\tIt's finished.\n\nJEZZIE stares at JACOB with a frightening, powerful glare. The edge of \nher coat rustles and flutters as she moves toward him. It is an \ninnocent sound at first, but after a moment it transforms into \nsomething else, an obsessive flapping noise, the sound of a wing.\n\nJACOB's body feels the first waves of an inner tremor. His legs are \nshaking.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWhat's going on?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tYour capacity for self-delusion is\n\t\tremarkable, Dr. Singer.\n\nJEZZIE begins walking around the dark living room as she talks to him. \nSomething about her walk is very unnatural. JACOB eyes her fearfully.\n\nIn the darkness JEZZIE's movements become increasingly strange and \nelusive. We see her pass before a shadow and disappear within it, only \nto reappear, seconds later, in a doorway on the other side of the room. \nJACOB spins around, confused. Suddenly JEZZIE is inches from his face, \nalthough it seems like there has been no time for her to get there. Her \nmovements are totally impossible, defying all logic, all physical laws.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWhat's wrong, Jake?\n\t\t\t(she mocks him)\n\t\tForget to take your antidote?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWho are you? What are you doing to me?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tYou have quite a mind, Jake. I loved\n\t\tyour friends. That chemist - the\n\t\tLadder. What an imagination you have!\n\nJACOB freezes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tAnd your vision of paradise ...\n\t\tfantastic! You're a real dreamer, you\n\t\tknow that? Only it's time to wake up.\n\nJEZZIE has disappeared in the darkness of the room. Only the sounds of \nflapping wings remain. They grow louder and more menacing, whooshing \npast him with no visible source.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tYour mind is crumbling, Jake. No more\n\t\t\"army.\" No more conspiracies. You're\n\t\tdying, Dr. Singer. It's over.\n\nJACOB, frightened, turns toward the door as if to hurry out. \"JEZZIE\" \nlaughs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWhere's to run, Jacob? Where's to go?\n\nJACOB pauses a moment and then turns to confront the terror behind him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b><b>\t\tWHO ARE YOU?\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tHow many times have you asked me\n\t\tthat?

Her coat collar obscures her and it \nseems for a moment that she has no face. Then, to JACOB's horror, she \nturns around. He is staring at the vibrating creature he has seen so \noften before. Glimpsed almost in abstraction it is a living terror, \ndark and undefinable. Its face is a black and impenetrable void in \nconstant vibration. Its voice is an unspeakable demonic cry, the \nessence of fear and suffering. JACOB pulls away from it, overhwelmed by \nconfusion. He is rooted in fear.\n\nA sudden wind howls through the room, great gales blowing JACOB's hair \nstraight up. It is like a hurricane pushing him into the wall. He can \nbarely stand. He struggles to pull himself away. The flapping sound \nreturns, charging at him from all directions. It is as if the darkness \nitself is swooping down, trying to envelop him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(whispering to himself)\n\t\tThis isn't happening.\n\nNew terrible sounds arise, chain saws slashing through the air, knives, \nand sabers ripping through space with unrelenting anger. Guns fire and \nexplode past his head. It is as though all the sounds of destruction \nare closing in on him. JACOB yells but his own voice is lost in the \nmelee. Terrified, he looks heavenward, as if crying for help.\n\nSuddenly, from the noise, a calm voice rises, speaking, as if from a \ndistance. It is LOUIS. JACOB is shocked to hear him. He stands \nmotionless.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS (V.O.)\n</b>\t\tIf you're frightened of dying you'll\n\t\tsee devils tearing you apart. If\n\t\tyou've made your peace then they're\n\t\tangels freeing you from the world.\n\nThe voice fades. JACOB just stands there, not sure what to do. And then \nthe sounds return. Only now they are more terrifying than ever. \nHideously loud, they become a cacophony of sounds, voices of parents, \nfriends, lovers, the sounds of battle, fighting, and dying.\n\nJACOB looks up and sees the creature in the center of the room. All the \nsounds seem to emenate from it. The more JACOB stares at it the louder \nthey become. After a moment, JACOB takes a huge breath. We sense a \ngreat resolve forming inside him. Then, slowly, courageously, he begins \nmoving toward it.\n\nNEw and more terrifying noises assault JACOB, attempting to drive him \nback, but he will not be stopped. He continues walking toward the \ncreature.\n\nIn the hallway a standing lamp slams sparking to the floor. It rolls \nback and forth like a living thing, with a maddening hypnotic \nregularity. Doors slam open and closed, unlatching, snapping, shutting, \nwith deafening force. The room itself seems like an organic presence. \nIt is alive, angry, and threatening.\n\nThe CREATURE sits in the midst of the insanity like the source of \nmadness itself. It writhes, contorts and vibrates with unstoppable \nfury. JACOB, terrified, but unrelenting, continues to approach it.\n\nAS THE CAMERA DRAWS CLOSER TO THE CREATURE'S HEAD the density of its \nfeatureless form overwhelms the screen. It is like staring into \nemptiness itself, the ultimate darkness.\n\nWith superhuman effort JACOB grabs hold of the creature. It is like \ngrabbing hold of a live wire. His body begins shaking uncontrollably \nlike a man being electrocuted. He is flying in all directions but does \nnot let go. His fingers claw at the creature's head. JACOB struggles \ndefiantly with the monster.\n\nSuddenly a terrible voice emerges from within it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCREATURE\n</b><b>\t\tWHO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE FIGHTING!\n</b>\nJACOB does not respond. It cries out again.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCREATURE\n</b><b>\t\tWHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE\n</b><b>\t\tFIGHTING?\n</b>\nDeep inside the darkness JACOB begins to make out the presence of a \nform, something writhing and tortured lurking before us. It looks \nbriefly like an animal until we realize it is the image of a human \nface. It is covered by a dark suffocating film, like a mask.\n\nJACOB digs into it with all his might and pulls it off.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\nDEAD SILENCE as JACOB SEES HIS OWN FACE staring back at him from \nbeneath the mask. It is JACOB SINGER as we first saw him on the \nbattlefield in Vietnam. Only now his image is pale and lifeless. It \ntakes JACOB a moment to realize that he is dead. The recognition is one \nof terrible confusion and pain. JACOB stares at himself for a long time \nas a huge cry wells up inside him. It bursts forth with devastating \nsadness.\n\nAs that instant the whole of space seems to explode in a flash of \ncatacylsmic power. Hundreds of images from JACOB's life flash before \nus, his birth, his childhood, his adulthood. The demons, the room, \nJEZZIE, LOUIS, MICHAEL, SARAH, all seem to assail us in a rush of \nblinding intensity.\n\nWe are flying over a landscape of memories, zooming across a constantly \nchanging field of images. Some of the images move, some of the people \nin them speak. They are not particularly significant memories, in some \nways they are quite banal, but something about them is infused with \nlife and joy. Even the painful moments resonate with vital force. Some \nof the moments we recognize from the time we've spent with JACOB. Some \nwe have not seen before. There is no order to them, no logic to why \nthey have been recalled.\n\nA newborn baby takes its first breath and screams. SARAH pulls clothes \noff a clothes line on a rainy day. JACOB's FATHER stands in the Florida \nsurf as sea foam laps gently at his legs. PAUL, FRANK, and JACOB play \ncards on the edge of a rice paddy. GABE rides his bike into the path of \nan oncoming car. A child puts his ear next to a bowl of cereal, \nlistening to it talk. A young girl standing in a doorway lifts up her \nblouse to show her new breasts. JACOB and SARAH slice a wedding cake \nthat topples to the floor. JEZZIE looks at JACOB and asks \"Love me a \nlittle?\"\n\nAnd then it is over. Total silence overwhelms the screen, a wonderful \nsoothing calm. JACOB's eyes open and he is shocked to find himself \nsitting on the floor in SARAH's apartment. He is all alone. The first \nrays of early morning sunlight are filtering through the window. \nSomething about the apartment seems transfigured, magical. JACOB sits \nmotionless, stunned to be back there.\n\nThe faint sound of music can be heard coming from the hallway. It is \nwarm and familiar, the tinkling of a music box. JACOB listens to it for \na few moments and then something registers inside him. Curious, he gets \nup and approaches the corridor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tHello?\n\nThere is no response. Suddenly the music stops. JACOB freezes for a \nmoment. He sees someone standing in the shadows at the other end.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWho is it? Who's there?\n\nTentatively JACOB moves forward. As he draws closer he begins to see \nthe outline of a child. Then, all of a sudden, he realizes who it is. \nHis eyes well up as he stands there, the full impact of the moment \nregistering inside him. It's his son, GABE. He is carrying the same \nmusical lunch box we have seen before. The young boy smiles warmly at \nhis father. It is the smile of an angel. JACOB swallows hard.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tGabe? Gabe!\n\nJACOB runs to his son. Unable to hold back the tears, he embraces him \nin a rush of love and emotion.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tGabe. Oh God. I don't believe ...\n\nThey hug one another over and over. JACOB, overcome, sits down on the \nstiars. After a moment GABE puts his arm around his father's shoulder \nin a gesture of surprising maturity and compassion. We sense for an \ninstant that their roles have reversed. GABE reaches for JACOB's hand \nand gently encourages him to stand up.\n\nWith a sweet tug GABE leads his father up the steps.\n\nSunlight streams down from the top of the stiars, hitting the first \nlanding. GABE is bathed in its warm glow. As JACOB reaches the landing, \nhe too is surrounded by the comforting light.\n\nGABE hurries up the last set of stairs. JACOB turns to follow but is \nstunned by the brilliance of the light pouring in from above. \nSquinting, he cannot see his son. Then suddenly GABE steps back out of \nthe light and takes his father's hand once more. His eyes sparkle with \nexcitement.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGABE\n</b>\t\tCome on Dad ... You know what we've\n\t\tgot? A sandbox just like the\n\t\tWilliston's, only it's bigger and the\n\t\tsand's all white. You won't believe\n\t\tit.\n\nJACOB smiles at his son. GABE smiles at him. It is a moment of total \neuphoria. THE CAMERA HOLDS as they continue up the stairs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGABE\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tAnd my parakeet. Remember, the one\n\t\tgrandma let out of the cage? He's\n\t\tokay. And he's talking now. He knows\n\t\tmy name.\n\nGABE's voice slowly trails off as he and his father disappear in the \nintenstity of the light. THE CAMERA HOLDS on the image. For a brief but \nstunning moment there appears to be a huge ethereal staircase \nshimmering before us. It rises up into infinite dimensions. Then the \nbrilliance of its blinding light overwhelms the screen.\n\nSuddenly the brightness condenses into a smaller light source. It holds \nfor a second and then flashes off. An overhead surgical lamp remains \nstubbornly in view.\n\n\n<b>INT.  VIETNAM FIELD HOSPITAL - DAY\n</b>\nA DOCTOR leans his head in front of the lamp and removes his mask. His \nexpression is somber. He shakes his head. His words are simple and \nfinal.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDOCTOR\n</b>\t\tHe's gone.\n\nCUT TO JACOB SINGER lying on an operating table in a large ARMY FIELD \nTENT in VIETNAM. The DOCTOR steps away. A NURSE rudely pulls a green \nsheet over his head. The DOCTOR turns to one of the aides and throws up \nhis hands in defeat.\n\nAN ORDERLY wheels JACOB's body past rows of other DOCTORS and NURSES \nfighting to save lives. A YOUNG VIETNAMESE BOY pulls back a screen door \nto let them out of the tent. It is a bright, fresh morning. The sun is \nrising.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHE END\n</b>\n\n\n\n\n<b>\"JACOB'S LADDER\" (DELETED SCENES)\n</b>\nby\n\nBruce Joel Rubin\n\n\n<b>---\n</b>\n<b>ADDENDUM 1:  PROFESSOR STERN\n</b>\n<b>--\n</b>\n\n<b>INT.  CITY COLLEGE LECTURE HALL - DAY\n</b>\nCUT TO a huge ampitheatre-style LECTURE HALL at CITY COLLEGE. It \nis almost empty. No more than FORTY STUDENTS are scattered near \nthe front of nearly three hundred seats. All are listening to \nPROFESSOR EMANUEL STERN who is nearing the end of his lecture.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTERN\n</b>\t\tThus at the core of today's discu-\n\t\tsion we find four fundamental doc-\n\t\ttrines. First, that the world of\n\t\tmatter and individual consciousness\n\t\tare both manifestations of one Divine\n\t\tReality.\n\nOne of the STUDENTS seems about to fall asleep and keeps nodding \nhis head.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTERN\n</b>\t\tEven you, Mr. Palmer, are part of it,\n\t\tas amazing as that may seem.\n\nMR. PALMER sits up quickly in his seat as other STUDENTS smile.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTERN\n</b>\t\tSecond, human beings are capable not\n\t\tonly of kowledge about this Divine Re-\n\t\tality by inference but can realize\n\t\tits existence by direct intuition,\n\t\tsuperior even to reason.\n\nA door opens in the upper reaches of the lecture hall. JACOB \nenters and walks quietly down the stairs to within hearing range \nof the professor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTERN\n</b>\t\tThird, man possesses a double nature,\n\t\tan ego and an eternal self, what we\n\t\tcall \"spirit\" or \"soul.\"\n\nJACOB takes a seat at one of the desks. There is a pencil lying \non it which he fingers distractedly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTERN\n</b>\t\tFourth, and most important, man's\n\t\tlife on earth has only one end and\n\t\tpurpose, to learn to let go of the\n\t\tseparate ego and to identify with the\n\t\tDivine spark within.\n\nMR. PALMER is nodding off again.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTERN\n</b>\t\tAlmost impossible to believe, isn't\n\t\tit Mr. Palmer, that somewhere in that\n\t\tunconscious head of yours lies the\n\t\tsource of all consciousness?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPALMER\n</b>\t\tYes, Sir.

So rather than\n\t\ttry, you are dismissed.\n\nThe STUDENTS seem surprised but not unhappy with the sudden \ndismissal. They quickly gather their books and begin the long \nclimb to the exits. Only JACOB remains seated.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tHello Prof.\n\nPROFESSOR STERN looks up and stares at KACOB for several seconds \nbefore recognizing him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTERN\n</b>\t\tMy oh my.

They are both fixing cups of tea, not \nspeaking. Suddenly JACOB looks at STERN.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI've got a problem, Prof. More Augus-\n\t\ttine than Kierkegaard, if you know\n\t\twhat I mean.\n\t\t\t(STERN looks at him\n\t\t\tquestioningly)\n\t\tI need to know about ... demons.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTERN\n</b>\t\t\t(surprised)\n\t\tDemons, Jacob?

Physically?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(hesitantly)\n\t\tYes.\n\nSTERN pauses. He looks at JACOB. The intensity of his gaze is \nunsettling and JACOB reaches for his tea. The cup rattles.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTERN\n</b>\t\tI know very little about demons, Ja-\n\t\tcob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them\n\t\tas literary figures, biblical ones\n\t\t...

The problem, Jacob, is\n\t\tthat you have no context for it.\n\t\tYou're a renegade Existentialist suf-\n\t\tfering demons a hundred years after\n\t\tFreud.

But if you're not\n\t\twilling to accept the help of sci-\n\t\tence; and believe me, I admire you\n\t\tfor that: then you'll have to do bat-\n\t\ttle on your own. What can I say? It's\n\t\ta lonely pilgrimage through our times\n\t\teven for the strongest souls.

Nothing.\n\nJACOB gazes at his old friend and mentor, frustration blazing in \nhis eyes. They are both surprised to see tears form and run down \nhis cheek. JACOB reaches for a napkin and dries them quickly. \nSTERN, uncomfortable in the face of emotion, turns away.\n\n<b>---\n</b>\n<b>ADDENDUM 2: THE PARTY AT DELLA'S\n</b>\n<b>---\n</b>\nSuddenly a strange and terrifying spectacle unfolds before him. \nThe DANCERS undergo a shocking transformation, a full three-\ndimensional alteration of their physical forms. Clothes fuse to \ntheir bodies like new skin. Horns and tails emerge and grow like \nexotic genitalia, exciting a frenzy among the DANCERS. New \nappendages appear unfolding from their flesh. Dorsal fins \nprotrude from their backs. Armored scales run in scallops down \ntheir legs. Tails entwine sensuously. Long tongues lick at the \nundersides of reptilian bellies. The metamorphosis holds a \nbiological fascination. Bones and flesh mold into new forms of \nlife, creatures of another world.\n\nCUT TO JACOB's face as it registers terror and disbelief. He \nstares at the DANCERS. They are perverse, corrupt aspects of \ntheir normal selves. He is mesmerized by JEZZIE. Her flesh has \ngrown hard and wrinkled and has the markings of a snake. Her \ntongue, long and curled, darts in and out of her mouth \nrepeatedly. Her eyes are thin and domineering. They lock JACOB in \ntheir gaze. He wants to stop, to run, but JEZZIE won't release \nhim.\n\nJACOB grabs his eyes as though trying to pull the vision from \nthem but it won't go away. The music throbs. His actions become \nspastic, almost delirious. His hysteria attracts the attention of \nthe other DANCERS.\n\nA circle forms around JACOB and JEZZIE as their frenzy transcends \nthe boundaries of dance and erupts into an almost orgiastic \ndisplay. JACOB is out of control. His fury becomes a kind of \nexorcism, a desperate attempt to free himself from his body and \nhis mind.\n\nCUT TO JACOB as his eyes pass beyond pain. The dark walls of the \nAPARTMENT fade away.\n\n\n<b>EXT.

Rings of light emanate from it \nfilling the sky with their sparkling brilliance. The rings draw \nus forward with a quickening intensity that grows into \nexhilarating speed. The rush causes them to flash \nstroboscopically and produce a dazzling, almost sensual, surge of \ncolor. The display is spectacular and compelling. A voice can be \nheard in the distance.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE\n</b>\t\tI think we're losing him.\n\nSuddenly the flickering rings begin to define a tangible image, a \nkind of CELESTIAL STAIRCASE, rising up into infinite dimensions. \nAs we speed toward it, it grows increasingly majestic. The image \nis so awesome and other-worldly that it is difficult to grasp \nwhat is being seen.\n\nMusic can be heard in the distance. It too is celestial in its \nbeauty. Then, unexpectedly, it grows hard and insistent, like a \nheartbeat. Heavy breathing accompanies the sound. The image of \nthe STAIRCASE shatters and disappears, replaced by intense \nflashes of red and blue light. The music grows louder and reaches \na thundering crescendo. Then silence.\n\n<b>---\n</b>\n<b>ADDENDUM 3: JACOB'S LIVING ROOM\n</b>\n<b>---\n</b>\n<b>INT.

There is no\n\t\tdraft evasions in this war. All are\n\t\tcalled. All must take up weapons. Are\n\t\tyou prepared? That's the question we\n\t\task.\n\nThe toilet flushes and JACOB walks back into the LIVING ROOM and \nturns down the sound.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAYES\n</b>\t\tDo you find people scoffing at you,\n\t\tReverend? After all, there have been\n\t\tdoomsayers for thousands of years and\n\t\twe're still here.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMURPHY\n</b>\t\tPeople are less apt to laugh these\n\t\tdays. The prophecies are too close\n\t\tfor comfort. I mean, all you have to\n\t\tdo is watch the news.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAYES\n</b>\t\tThere are some who claim that your\n\t\tpessimism is defeatist and what the\n\t\tworld needs now is hope, a positive\n\t\tthrust.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMURPHY\n</b>\t\tI think the time for hope has passed.\n\t\tThe seeds have been planted.

In an\n\t\tinterview ...\n\nSuddenly the telephone rings. It startles JACOB. He jumps. It \nrings again. He reaches down, turns off the T.V., and picks up \nthe phone. His eyes continue to stare at the blank screen as he \ntalks.\n\n<b>---\n</b>\n<b>ADDENDUM 4: JACOB'S BEDROOM\n</b>\n<b>---\n</b>\n<b>INT.  JACOB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nTHE BEDROOM is dark. JACOB and JEZZIE are making love. A half-\nsmoked joint is smouldering in an ashtray by the bed. JEZZIE is \npoised on top of JACOB and his eyes are focused on her face.\n\nA hurricane lamp casts a warm glow over their bodies. Its \nflickering light plays games with JACOB's eyes and for a moment \nJEZZIE seems to disappear. JACOB reaches out for her breasts and \nhis hands seem to vanish into the shadows dancing across her. \nWith sudden, hallucinogenic impact, JACOB feels himself drawn \ninto a starry universe opening from inside her.\n\nTHE CAMERA plunges through her image into a galxy of stars and \nrushes toward one that is twinkling brightly. Pulsations of its \nlight whiten the screen. Out of the whiteness appears a momentary \nflash of the CELESTIAL STAIRCASE, accompanied by sounds of sexual \nclimax.\n\nThe STAIRCASE sparkles for an instant and then it's gone. The \nsparkle becomes a glimmer in JEZZIE's eye as her face fills the \nscreen. She looks especially lovely and radiant. Her image moves \nwith the lamplight.\n\nJACOB's face is ecstatic. He can barely talk and simply basks in \nJEZZIE's glow. Slowly, she leans forward and whispers in his ear.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tSo tell me ... am I still an angel?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(smiling broadly)\n\t\tWith wings.\n\t\t\t(he strokes her hair)\n\t\tYou transport me, you know that? You\n\t\tcarry me away.\n\n<b>---\n</b>\n<b>ADDENDUM 5: DEMON IN THE WALL\n</b>\n<b>---\n</b>\n<b>INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - DAY\n</b>\nJACOB is sitting in a comfortable chair in his living room. He is \nreading. The room is dark, lit only by a reading light. The walls \nare mostly in shadow. The light, however, falls on one section of \nthe wall, a portion that has been lined in fake wood paneling.\n\nJACOB's eyes suddenly lift off the page and roam over the wood \ngrain on the wall. All of a sudden he notices something strange, \nan image in the grain. He stares at it. The more he stares the \nmore precise its definition. The image of a DEMON appears in the \nwall.\n\nJACOB sits up quickly and stares at the walll. It is impossible \nto get the DEMON's image out of the grain. It seems etched, even \nimbedded, in the paneling.\n\nJACOB looks away and returns to his book. He is reading about \narchetypes and the primordial mind. But the book does not hold \nhis attention. He is obsessed with the wall. Its molecules seem \nsuddenly active, the wood grain suddenly animate. Layers begin to \nappear in the surface of the wall as the grain patterns slowly \ndefine a rocky, barren landscape.\n\nThe DEMON is growing solid. Cries and screams rise up in the \ndistance. Flames and a red glow emanate from the space extending \nrapidly into the wall. The image of Hell erupts before him.\n\nJACOB stands up. He can see bodies suffering beyond the wall, \nmasses of PEOPLE wailing and enduring the torments of a fiery \nworld. The DEMON's arm slowly extends from the plane of the wall \nand reaches into the room. He is huge, covered in flames and \nskulls, a living horror. He grabs hold of JACOB and pulls him \ntoward the wall. JACOB tries to back away but he cannot. His face \nis white with fear. The DEMON draws JACOB toward the inferno.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(yelling at the top of\n\t\t\this lungs)\n<b>\t\tNO!\n</b>\nSuddenly JEZZIE appears, the light from the BEDROOM flooding the \npaneled wall. The DEMON vanishes instantly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tJake, are you all ... ?\n\nShe stops dead in her tracks.\n\nCUT TO JACOB pressed up against the wall, defying gravity and \nlogic, as though about to merge with the solid surface. His body \nholds there for a moment and then collapses to the floor. JEZZIE \ngoes to him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tJake? Jake?\n\nHe doesn't answer. He looks at JEZZIE with a blank stare. His \nbody begins shaking.\n\n\n<b>INT.  JACOB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nJACOB is lying on the bed, curled up in a fetal pose. JEZZIE is \nstroking his hair and trying to calm him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tIt's going to be all right, Jake.\n\t\tIt's going to be all right. Don't be\n\t\tafraid. I've got you now.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tHold me, Jezzie. Hold me.\n\nJEZZIE wraps herself around his shivering body and warms him with \nher own. The image seems tender and comforting until we notice \nJEZZIE's tongue darting nervously in and out. It looks strangely \nlike a snake's.\n\n<b>---\n</b>\n<b>ADDENDUM 6: THE HOSPITAL\n</b>\n<b>---\n</b>\nThe RESIDENT injects the serum into JACOB's veins while two \nORDERLIES hold him still. JACOB barely struggles. His eyes fixate \non the EMERGENCY ROOM WALL. It is white and sterile. Within \nmoments it begins to emit a reddish glow. JACOB watches with \nastonishment as the wall's two-dimensional surface separates into \nthree-dimensional planes. The solid surface gives way to a DARK \nCHAMBER that was not there before.\n\nOut of the transmuted space CREATURES begin to form. Bosch-like \nDEMONS with horns and tails, undeniably of another world. Slowly \nseveral of them emerge from the wall and approach JACOB. They \nlook like parodies of doctors and nurses, wearing traditional \nhospital gowns. Without a word they wheel him through the space \nwhere the wall had been. JACOB tries to scream but no sound comes \nout.\n\n\n<b>INT.  HELL - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe DARK CHAMBER is filled with mournful CREATURES being led by \nDEMONS through a series of CORRIDORS. No one fights or struggles. \nJACOB's stretcher is moved through the darkness. He tries to sit \nup but is forced back down. He is obviously drugged.\n\nJACOB is wheeled into a tiny CHAMBER. A number of DEMONS are \nwaiting for him. Chains and pulleys hang from the ceiling. They \nare lowered and attached with speed and efficiency to JACOB's \narms and legs. The devices are manipulated smoothly and JACOB is \nlifted off the stretcher. The chains retract, stretching him \nspread-eagle in the air. He screams loudly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tOh God!\n\nThe DEMONS laugh. There is the sound of a huge door closing. \nJACOB is left in darkness. The darkness is hallucinogenic. Fires \nappear beyond the boundaries of the wall; images of Dante's \nInferno, souls of the dead in endless torment. JACOB is but one \nof countless beings sharing a vastness of torment. His own \nscreams for help are lost in the magnitude of voices crying.\n\nSuddenly, out of the meancing shadows, a contingent of DEMONS \nemerges. They are carrying sharp surgical instruments. They \nsurround JACOB, their eyes glistening as bright as their blades. \nJACOB is panting and sweating with fear. For an instant, one of \nthe DEMONS looks like JEZZIE. JACOB calls out to her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tJezzie! Help me!\n\nThe DEMONS laugh as she changes form. They take great pleasure in \nhis suffering. Their voices are strange and not human. Each \nutterance contains a multitude of contradictory tones, sincere \nand compassionate, taunting and mocking at the same time. The \nconfusion of meanings is a torment of its own.\n\n<b>---\n</b>\n<b>ADDENDUM 7: JACOB'S BEDROOM\n</b>\n<b>---\n</b>\n<b>INT.  JACOB'S BEDROOM\n</b>\nJACOB is lying on the floor of his BEDROOM doing exercises for \nhis back. He has several days' growth of beard and does not look \nwell. His mind is drifting and only the occasional pain in his \nback reminds him of what he is doing. JEZZIE can be heard \nvacuuming the carpet in the LIVING ROOM. Suddenly the door swings \nopen. The wail of the vacuum cleaner causes JACOB to tense. His \neyes drift down from the ceiling. JEZZIE vacuums around him and \nseems insensitive to his presence.\n\nJEZZIE shoves the vacuum cleaner under the bed and hits \nsomething. JACOB tightens. She looks and is shocked to discover a \ncan of gasoline and boxes of kitchen matches. It takes her a \nsecond to understand the implications of what she has found. \nJACOB is ready when she begins yelling.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tYou're completely off your rocker,\n\t\tyou know that? You'd think you fell\n\t\ton your head instead of your back.\n\t\tWhat are you planning to do, burn\n\t\tdown the apartment along with your\n\t\tdemons?\n\nShe begins to remove the gasoline can.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(yelling)\n\t\tDon't you touch it.\n\t\t\t(he glares at her)\n\nJEZZIE lets go of the can and grabs the vacuum. She moves it \nfuriously across the carpet. Suddenly JACOB sees her tongue \ndarting in and out, unconsciously. She looks strange, not human. \nJACOB freezes. He yells out.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWho are you?\n\nThe sound of the vacuum cleaner drowns out his voice. He yells \nagain. JEZZIE sees him and turns off the machine. His voice booms \nout.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWho the hell are you?\n\nJEZZIE ignores the question and turns the vacuum cleaner back on. \nJACOB rolls over and pulls out the plug.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWhy won't you answer me?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\t\t(angry)\n\t\tCause you know goddamn well who I am.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tI don't know you.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tYou've lived with me for two years.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tThat doesn't mean shit.

Well, I've had it.\n\t\tYou flip out on your own, you\n\t\tungrateful bastard. I'm done holding\n\t\tyour hand. I don't want anything to\n\t\tdo with you, you hear? Nothing!\n\nShe storms out of the room, kicking the vacuum cleaner as she \ngoes. JACOB can see flashes of her through the open crack of the \nbedroom door. Occasional curses and epithets hurl through the \nopening along with a flood of tears.\n\nJACOB catches glimpses of her as she grabs her coat from the hall \ncloset and as she pulls her money out of the desk drawer. He can \nsee the lamp as she shoves it to the floor and hears it shatter \nas she stomps on it with her foot. There is a blur as she heads \nto the front door and a deafening bang as she leaves.\n\nJACOB's eyes drift up to the ceiling. They hardly blink. He \nstares at the plaster, chipped and cracked, above him. Suddenly \nthe cracks begin to move. JACOB jumps up. A DEMON is \nmaterializing over his head. JACOB yells and grabs hold of the \nextension pole for the vacuum cleaner. With a furious cry he \nbegins jamming it at the ceiling. Rather than blot out the \nevolving image his attack helps to define it. JACOB slams harder. \nPlaster and wood lath cover the floor. The DEMON is gone. Panting \nhard, JACOB reaches for matches and the gasoline can. He stops \nand stares at them with great intensity.\n\n<b>---\n</b>\n<b>ADDENDUM 8: THE ANTIDOTE SEQUENCE\n</b>\n<b>---\n</b>\nThe ceiling begins to rumble. Cracks split wide open. Huge \ncrevasses tear through the plaster. JACOB's world is crumbling. \nHe stares in horror as DEMONIC FORMS attempt to surge through the \nrupture above him. Piercing eyes and sharp teeth glimmer in the \ndarkness. Hooved feet and pointed claws clamor to break through.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n<b>\t\tHELP ME!\n</b>\nInstantly MICHAEL appears standing over him. He is holding the \nvial with the antidote. He draws an eyedropper full of the fluid \nand holds it over JACOB's mouth.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tTake it!\n\nJACOB fights him but MICHAEL forces the entire contents of the \neyedropper down his throat. JACOB gags. He tries to spit it out, \nbut can't.\n\nSuddenly the ceiling erupts in violent clashes as whole chunks \nbreak off and collide with one another like continental plates. \nThe collisions wreak havoc on the DEMONS, chopping and \ndismembering them. Body parts fall from the ceiling like a \nDevil's rain. Horrible screams echo from the other side.\n\nFlashes of light and dark storm over JACOB's head, thundering \nlike a war in the heavens. It is a scene of raw power and growing \ncatastrophe. It builds in fury and rage until suddenly the \nceiling explodes.\n\nMatter atomizes instantly. Trillions of particles hurl \nchaotically in all directions. The walls shatter into a dazzling \nbrightness. For a moment there is a sense of intense forward \nmovement, a rush toward oblivion. And then, suddenly, it stops. \nThere is absolute quiet and stillness.\n\nJACOB's eyes stare into the formlessness sparkling around him. \nAll space has become a shining void. Gradually faint pastel \ncolors appear like colored molecules, dancing and spinning, \nredirecting space into new formations. They weave patterns of \nintricate complexity and stunning beauty.\n\nAs the colors grow brighter and more vivid their abstraction \ngives way to solid form. A GARDEN SCENE emerges. It is a GARDEN \nOF LIGHT, a vast, almost mythic, Rousseau paradise. It radiates \nan intense shimmering light.\n\nJACOB's eyes are cpativated by the vision before him. A sudden \nmovement catches his attention. He looks up and notices MICHAEL \nstill standing beside him. MICHAEL, however, is rapidly changing \nform. It is a full, plastic, three-dimensional metamorphosis. His \nvery flesh seems to expand and glow with its own inner light. His \nface shines and radiates an almost transcendental beauty.\n\nJACOB is nearly blinded by MICHAEL's presence and must shield his \neyes to look at him. MICHAEL smiles an extraordinary and joyous \nsmile that radiates such intense luminosity that JACOB has to \nsquint to see it.\n\nSuddenly MICHAEL steps off the ground. He rises into the air and \nfloats above JACOB. JACOB can barely breathe as he watches him. \nMICHAEL rises into a sky filled with orbs and blazing lights. The \nlights shine on JACOB's head. He effervesces and shimmers in \ntheir glow.\n\nOne of the orbs sends a burst of light exploding over JACOB. So \nintense is the light that JACOB grabs his eyes. As he opens them \nagain he sees that the GARDEN is fading back into pure light. \nMICHAEL, too, is fading.\n\nAnother burst of light and the GARDEN is reabsorbed by the void. \nOnly the brightness remains. It is many seconds before we realize \nthat the HOTEL ROOM is coming together, reconstructed by the \nlight. In moments it is fully formed. Sunlight is pouring through \nthe window. MICHAEL is sleeping lightly in a chair. He hears \nJACOB stare and sits up.\n\nJACOB is sitting on the bed. He does not seem to know where he \nis. His eyes are filled with awe. They move slowly around the \nroom, taking everything in. He doesn't speak. MICHAEL gets up and \nsits beside him. He respects his silence.\n\n<b>---\n</b>\n<b>ADDENDUM 9: HOTEL ROOM\n</b>\n<b>---\n</b>\n<b>INT.  HOTEL ROOM - DAY\n</b>\nJACOB enters the HOTEL ROOM. JEZZIE is already there watching the \nevening news. She is still in her postal uniform, lying on the \nbed. She taps the mattress, inviting JACOB to lie next to her.

There's\n\t\tnothing more to say.\n\nThere is a quiet rage building in JEZZIE's eyes as she continues \nto stroke JACOB's chest. He tries to relax and give himself over \nto the movement of her hand. Silently she leans over and begins \nlicking his stomach. JACOB's eyes close. His stomach hardens. He \nreaches back and adjusts the pillow beneath his head. Slowly, \nJEZZIE works her way back up to his chest. Her tongue darts in \nand out suggestively. He eyes are burning with anger. Her mouth \npoises itself over his nipple. She toys with it for a few seconds \nand then chomps down hard. The bite draws blood.\n\nJACOB screams. His eyes shoot open. For the flash of an instant \nhe sees a DEMON hovering over him, a hideous horned creature \nlicking his blood. JACOB flies off the bed as the creature hurls \nto the floor. JACOB is ready to pounce on it when he sees that it \nis JEZZIE lying at his feet. His head begins reeling. He backs \naway from the bed, not taking his eyes off JEZZIE for a second. \nHe backs to the closet and grabs his coat.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tJake. What are you doing?

JACOB watches in horror as her skull gives \nbirth to pointed horns.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tOh God!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tWhat's wrong, Jake?\n\t\t\t(she mocks him)\n\t\tForget to take your antidote?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(screaming)\n\t\tGoddamn you!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\t\t(smiling and then\n\t\t\tlaughing)\n\t\tI loved your chemist, Jake. The\n\t\theight of fantasy. And your vision of\n\t\tparadise.\n\t\t\t(she laughs with a hu-\n\t\t\tmiliating tone)\n\t\tA most romantic creation. You're\n\t\tquite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time\n\t\tto wake up.\n\nJACOB's eyes are locked on JEZZIE. His mouth is wide open. His \nbody is shaking badly. He tries to back away from her but his \nlegs barely move.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tThere is nowhere to run, Jacob.\n\t\tYou're home.\n\nSuddenly the pictures on the wall crash to the floor. Plaster \nfrom the ceiling breaks off in huge chunks and slams to the \ncarpet. Light bulbs and lamps explode. JACOB runs to the door. He \npulls it open and screams. He is on the edge of a fiery abyss. \nJEZZIE laughs with a new intensity of demonic force. JACOB spins \naround.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b><b>\t\tWHO ARE YOU?\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\tHow many times have you asked me\n\t\tthat? How many times?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b><b>\t\tTELL ME, DAMN YOU!\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tJEZZIE\n</b>\t\t\t(with consummate power)\n\t\tYou know who I am.\n\nSuddenly JEZZIE reaches for her tongue and pulls at it with all \nher might. It is an act of total, unrelieved grotesqueness. With \neach yank the horror grows as JEZZIE literally pulls herself \ninside out before JACOB's eyes.\n\nThe emerging creature is JEZZIE transfigured, a demonic presence \nbeyond anything we have seen before. It is black and covered with \na thick oozing slime. Its head, still recognizable as JEZZIE, is \nrodent-like, with piercing green eyes and terrible horns \nprotruding from its brow. Its powerful arms have long spiked \nclaws. Its feet are cloven hooves. Extending from its back is a \nlong, thick, muscular tail that whips around the room with \ndevastating force. It throws furniture crashing through the air.\n\nA sudden cracking sound emerges from the DEMON's back. Dark forms \npenetrate the air. JACOB is breathless as huge wings unfold and \nspread out to the living room walls. The sound of their flapping \nis deafening. The walls shatter from their blows. As they crumble \ndarkness appears on the other side. There are no other rooms. The \nVOID envelops them. The INFERNO emerges in all directions. The \nDEMON roars.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEMON\n</b>\t\t\t(with JEZZIE's voice)\n\t\tStill love me, Jake?\n\t\t\t(it laughs and reaches\n\t\t\tout to him)\n<b>\t\tCOME!\n</b>\nCUT TO JACOB's face. He has gone beyond fear. An intensity of \nrage is building in him that we have not witnessed before. His \nwhole image seems transformed by it. He glows like a volcano \nbefore it erupts.\n\nSuddenly he explodes. The full fury of the Ladder detonates \ninside him. He yells at the DEMON with all his might.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b><b>\t\tNO!!!!!\n</b>\nWith a power and energy of devastating force he attacks the \nDEMON. JACOB is battling for his very soul and tears at the DEMON \nwith an animalistic fury that takes it by surprise. Its giant \nwings flap furiously, lifting them both up off the floor. JACOB \nkeeps fighting. He claws, bites, and rips at the wings, \ndecimating their delicate fabric.\n\nThe DEMON, shocked, and trying to gain control, crashes up \nthrough the last fragments of the ceiling. JACOB does not let go. \nThey burst into the fiery darkness. The room crumbles beneath \nthem and disappears into the void.\n\nThe abyss opens beneath them. JACOB continues his attack. His \nlegs are locked around the DEMON's waist. His hands dig into her \neyes. The DEMON shrieks and surges downward with awesome \nvelocity.\n\nThe DEMON charges into a rocky slope, smashing JACOB into its \ncliffs. JACOB claws at her wings, shredding as much of them as he \ncan reach. The DEMON takes a huge chunk out of JACOB's arm. JACOB \nscreams, grabs a rock, and shatters the DEMON's teeth. The DEMON \nfalls to the ground. JACOB holds on.\n\nAll of a sudden the DEMON begins to shrink. JACOB is shocked and \nstruggles to contain it. As it dwindles in size it reorders its \nshape. Within seconds a powerful INSECT is cupped in his hands. \nJACOB tries to crush it but it stings with such force that \nJACOB's entire body recoils. The stinging persists. JACOB hurls \nhimself to the ground on top of his arms to hold the CREATURE \ndown. So massive is the INSECT's attack. however, that JACOB's \nwhole body heaves off the ground with each sting. Then the \nattacks subside. JACOB waits for the next blow.\n\nSuddenly JACOB's body shoots straight up. His hands fly apart as \na new life form erupts between them. He holds on tightly as flesh \nand blood mold and expand between his fingers. The new body takes \nrapid shape. It is a CHILD. JACOB grasps it with all his might as \nit completes its identity. He is horrified when he sees it. It is \nhis son.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELI\n</b>\t\tDaddy!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tOh God!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELI\n</b>\t\tYou're hurting me!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\t\t(yelling)\n\t\tStop!!!!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELI\n</b>\t\tDaddy. Let go.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tWhat do you want from me?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELI\n</b><b>\t\tLET GO!\n</b>\nJACOB does not let up. In an instant his SON explodes into a \ngelatinous form, constantly undulating and changing shape. Within \nits translucent mass a new body is forming. JACOB stares at it \nwith growing terror. It is himself. A terrible perplexity fills \nJACOB's eyes as he struggles to dig in and destroy his own image. \nHe recoils as his own voice calls out to him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE\n</b>\t\tWho the Hell do you think you're\n\t\tfighting?\n\nThe words shock him and for the first time, he lets go.\n\nInstantly the image disappears and the jelly-like mass dissolves \ninto an oily liquid rapidly encircling his feet. JACOB looks down \nat the shallow pool spreading out beneath him. Its surface \nreflects a smoky, unearthly light.\n\nJACOB gazes into the darkness. He is all alone. The quiet \noverwhelms him. The only sound is his own breath. He looks \naround, in all directions, but can see nothing. The CAMERA holds \non him as he stands waiting for the next assault, but nothing \ncomes. He is left only with his anticipation and with hinself. He \nstares at the terrible darkness.\n\nA subtle phospheresence begins to glow in the liquid beneath \nJACOB's feet. He steps away from it, but it follows his movement. \nSuddenly, as if by spontaneous combustion, it bursts into flames. \nJACOB screams and tries to run but the flames move with him, \nlapping at his legs. He cannot escape them. As far and as fast as \nhe runs the fire is with him. He yells and cries and screams as \nthe fire eats at his lower limbs. He falls and jumps back up \nagain, his hands charred. His eyes grow wild.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACOB\n</b>\t\tOh God, help me.\n\nInstantly the flames roar and engulf him. It is total \nconflagration. JACOB's skin blisters and turns black. His flesh \ncrackles. Writhing in pain he runs through the flames but can \nfind no freedom from his suffering.\n\nAll at once JACOB stops running. He throws his hands up into the \nburning air and stands motionless, in absolute agony. It is a \ngesture of total submission and surrender to forces beyond \nhimself. His flesh bubbles and chars but something is suddenly \nquiet inside him.\n\nThrough the flames JACOB's dark form can be seen as it slowly \nsits down, like a Buddhist monk, in the midst of the holocaust. \nHe appears a figure of sudden nobility as the flames annihilate \nhim.\n\nGradually the fire dies. JACOB's body, his flesh like a charred \nand brittle shell, sits motionless, beyond pain. An orange glow \nfrom the embers of his body slowly fades, leaving him in the \nfinal darkness.\n\nThe SCREEN stays dark for as long as possible. Then, slowly, an \neerie light appears in an unfamiliar sky. It backlights JACOB, \nrevealing his silhouette. The CAMERA dollies slowly toward him. \nIt approaches the burned and unrecognizable remains of JACOB's \nface. It is the face of death. The CAMERA holds on the image.\n\nSuddenly, with shocking impact, JACOB's eyes move. Within the \ncrumbling shell of a body something is still alive, still \nconscious. The eyes survey the darkness and the first stirrings \nof a new light.\n\nIt is dawn. JACOB's dark remains are suffused by a preternatural \nglow. Slowly, huge orbs begin to appear on the horizon. JACOB's \neyes open to the growing light as they seek out the familiar in \nthe still dark lansdcape. Gradually the orbs begin their ascent \nlike a thousand suns rising at the same time. JACOB's eyes widen \nas his new world stands revealed. He is sitting in a GARDEN OF \nLIGHT, the Rousseau paradise he has visited once before.\n\nA sudden burst of light fills the sky directly overhead. The \nvegetation around him is instantly illuminated with its soft \nglow. Like a gentle breeze MICHAEL descends from the light and \nstands radiant before JACOB. He smiles and the air itself seems \nto brighten. MICHAEL quietly approaches JACOB's body.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tI am with you, Jacob.\n\nJACOB stares at him through dark eyes with a mixture of awe and \ndisbelief.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\t\t(speaking with a gentle\n\t\t\tcompassion)\n\t\tIt's all right now. It's over. You've\n\t\twon. You're here.\n\t\t\t(JACOB stares at him\n\t\t\tquestioningly. MICHAEL\n\t\t\treaches out his hands)\n\t\tTrust me.\n\nSoftly MICHAEL places his hands on top of JACOB's head and begins \nto peel at the charred flesh. Layer by layer he strips it away. \nThen, with an unexpected gesture, he rips away a whole section \nwith one quick pull. A BLAZE OF LIGHT bursts through the gaping \nhole in JACOB's head and beams into the air around them. It is an \nastounding sight.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tCome on. Don't make me do it all.\n\t\t\t(his eyes sparkle)\n\t\tStand up.\n\t\t\t(JACOB's eyes are burst-\n\t\t\ting with wonder)\n\t\tYou can do it.\n\nSlowly JACOB begins to stir. He moves feebly at first, like an \nold man. His black flesh creaks and cracks and through each \nsudden fissure another beam of light blasts out with laserlike \nintensity.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tStop hobbling. Your flesh can't hold\n\t\tyou anymore.\n\nJACOB nods in response and takes a huge, gigantic breath. His \nlungs expand and suddenly all the old flesh bursts from his body \nas a radiant being of light breaks through beneath it. JACOB \nstands transfigured, filled with his own luminosity. His face is \nlike a child's as he stares in amazement at his own hands, \nglowing with light.\n\nMICHAEL directs JACOB's vision to the sunrise. It is majestic, \nalmost Biblical in its grandeur. Great rays of light penetrate \nvast cloud formations and descend into the GARDEN. Slowly the \nclouds, as if orchestrated by some higher power, begin to part. A \nmassive light complex emerges from behind them. JACOB watches, \nawestruck, as the CELESTIAL STAIRWAY stands revealed. It reaches \ndown from unknown heights, radiating an infinite power and grace. \nIt touches down far in the distance, hovering over many acres of \nteh GARDEN. JACOB's eyes are filled with its splendor. MICHAEL \nlooks at him and nods.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tGo on, Jacob. It has come for you.\n\nJACOB cannot speak. His eyes are fixed on the STAIRWAY dazzling \nhim from afar. He can see ANGELIC FORMS moving up and down it. \nSuddenly, as if transported by light itself, he feels himself \nfloating up into the air. He looks down upon EDEN sparkling below \nhim. His mouth is wide open as he soars above it.\n\nThe light pulsating from the STAIRWAY is brilliant and thrilling. \nJACOB's own inner light intensifies as he approaches it. The \nSTAIRWAY grows increasingly wondrous as we draw nearer. It pulls \nJACOB toward it.\n\nSTREAMS OF ANGELS enter the STAIRWAY like a fast flowing river. \nIt carries them instantly within its current up beyond the \nvisible reaches of the glittering sky. Billowing clouds glow in a \nparade of colors and the starry heavens seem to part as the \nSTAIRWAY reaches beyond all known dimensions.\n\nJACOB stares at the light that is about to absorb him. It is a \nmoment of total euphoria. He surges into the stream as the \nbrilliant light of the STAIRWAY overwhelms the screen.\n\nSlowly the brightness of the screen condenses into a smaller \nlight source. An overhead surgical lamp remains stubbornly in \nview.\n\n\n<b>INT.  VIETNAM FIELD HOSPITAL - DAY\n</b>\nA DOCTOR leans his head in front of the lamp and removes his \nmask. His expression is somber. He shakes his head. His words are \nsimple and final.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDOCTOR\n</b>\t\tHe's gone.\n\nCUT TO JACOB SINGER lying on an operating table in a large ARMY \nFIELD TENT in VIET NAM. The DOCTOR steps away. A NURSE rudely \npulls a green sheet up over his head. The DOCTOR turns to one of \nthe aides and throws up his hands in defeat.\n\nTWO ORDERLIES wheel JACOB's body past rows of other DOCTORS and \nNURSES fighting to save lives. A YOUNG VIETNAMESE BOY pulls back \na screen door to let them out of the tent. It is a bright, fresh \nmorning. The sun is rising.\n\n\n<b>THE END\n</b>\n\nNow, answer the question based on the story asconcisely as you can, using a single phrase if possible.

{"article": "Answer the question based on the given passages. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nAustrobaileyales\nAustrobaileyales is an order of flowering plants consisting of about 100 species of woody plants growing as trees, shrubs and lianas. The best-known species is Illicium verum, commonly known as star anise. The order belongs to the group of basal angiosperms, the ANA grade (Amborellales, Nymphaeales, and Austrobaileyales), which diverged earlier from the remaining flowering plants. Austrobaileyales is sister to all remaining extant angiosperms outside the ANA grade.The order includes just three families of flowering plants, the Austrobaileyaceae, a monotypic family containing the sole genus, Austrobaileya scandens, a woody liana, the Schisandraceae, a family of trees, shrubs, or lianas containing essential oils, and the Trimeniaceae, essential oil-bearing trees and lianas.\n\nIn different classifications\nUntil the early 21st century, the order was only rarely recognised by systems of classification (an exception is the Reveal system).\nThe APG system, of 1998, did not recognize such an order. The APG II system, of 2003, does accept this order and places it among the basal angiosperms, that is: it does not belong to any further clade. APG II uses this circumscription:\n\norder Austrobaileyales\nfamily Austrobaileyaceae, one species of woody vines from Australia\nfamily Schisandraceae [+ family Illiciaceae], several dozen species of woody plants, found in tropical to temperate regions of East and Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. The best known of those is Star anise.\nfamily Trimeniaceae, half-a-dozen species of woody plants found in subtropical to tropical Southeast Asia, eastern Australia and the Pacific IslandsNote: \"+ ...\"=optional segregate family, that may be split off from the preceding family. The Cronquist system, of 1981, also placed the  plants in families Illiciaceae and Schisandraceae together, but as separate families, united at the rank of order, in the order Illiciales.\nPassage 2:\nTibouchina\nTibouchina  is a neotropical flowering plant genus in the family Melastomataceae. Species of this genus are subshrubs, shrubs or small trees and typically have purple flowers. They are native to Mexico, the Caribbean, and South America where they are found as far south as northern Argentina. Members of this genus are known as glory bushes, glory trees or princess flowers. The name Tibouchina is adapted from a Guianan indigenous name for a member of this genus. A systematic study in 2013 showed that as then circumscribed the genus was paraphyletic, and in 2019 the genus was split into a more narrowly circumscribed Tibouchina, two re-established genera Pleroma and Chaetogastra, and a new genus, Andesanthus.\n\nDescription\nTibouchina species are subshrubs, shrubs or small trees. Their leaves are opposite, usually with petioles, and often covered with scales. The inflorescence is a panicle or some modification of a panicle with reduced branching. The individual flowers have five free petals, purple or lilac in color; the color does not change as the flowers age. There are ten stamens, either all the same or dimorphic, with five larger and five smaller ones. The connective tissue below the anthers of the stamens is prolonged and modified at the base of the stamens into ventrally bilobed appendages. When mature, the seeds are contained in a dry, semiwoody capsule and are cochleate (spiralled).\n\nTaxonomy\nThe genus Tibouchina was established by Aublet in 1775 in his Flora of French Guiana with the description of a single species, T. aspera, which is thus the type species. In 1885, in his treatment for Flora brasiliensis, Alfred Cogniaux used a broad concept of the genus, transferring into it many of the species at that time placed in Chaetogastra, Diplostegium, Lasiandra, Pleroma and Purpurella, among others. This broad concept was generally adopted subsequently, and around 470 taxa were at one time or another assigned to Tibouchina.\n\nPhylogeny\nA phylogenetic analysis in 2013 based on molecular data (2 plastid and 1 nuclear regions) determined that the traditional circumscription of Tibouchina was paraphyletic. Four major clades were resolved within the genus which were supported by morphological, molecular and geographic evidence. Based on the traditional code of nomenclature, the clade that the type species falls in retains the name of the genus; therefore, the clade containing Tibouchina aspera remains Tibouchina.A further molecular phylogenetic study in 2019 used the same molecular markers but included more species. It reached the same conclusion: the original broadly circumscribed Tibouchina consisted of four monophyletic clades. The authors proposed a split into four genera: a more narrowly circumscribed Tibouchina, two re-established genera Pleroma and Chaetogastra, and a new genus, Andesanthus. The relationship between Chaetogastra and the genus Brachyotum differed between a maximum likelihood analysis and a Bayesian inference analysis: the former found Brachyotum embedded within Chaetogastra, the latter found the two to be sisters. The part of their maximum likelihood cladogram which includes former Tibouchina species is as follows, using their genus names and with shading added to show the original broadly circumscribed Tibouchina s.l.:\n\nAs re-circumscribed, Tibouchina is monophyletic and contains species belonging to the traditional sections T. section Tibouchina and T. section Barbigerae. Diagnostic characteristics include the presence of scale-like trichomes on the hypanthium and leaves and a long pedoconnective on lilac anthers, and the absence of glandular trichomes. Species are found in savanna habitats.\n\nSpecies\nAs of May 2022, Plants of the World Online accepts the following species within Tibouchina:\n\nSelected former species\nSpecies placed in Tibouchina in its former broad sense include:\n\nDistribution and invasive potential\nAll the species of Tibouchina are native to the Americas as far north as Mexico south to northern Argentina, with many found in Brazil, and others in Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, French Guiana, Guyana, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. Members of Tibouchina tend to be found in lowland savannas and on the lower slopes of the Andes. All Tibouchina species as well as those formerly placed in the genus are considered noxious weeds in Hawaii, because of their high potential for being invasive species. Many species, such as T. araguaiensis, T. papyrus, T. mathaei and T. nigricans, have narrow distributions, being known from only a handful of locations, while a few other species, including T. aspera, T. barbigera and T. bipenicillata, have broader distributions.\nPassage 3:\nCyrtandra (plant)\nCyrtandra (Neo-Latin, from Greek κυρτός, kyrtós, \"curved\", and ἀνήρ, anḗr, \"male\", in reference to their prominently curved stamens) is a genus of flowering plants containing about 600 species, with more being discovered often, and is thus the largest genus in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands, with the centre of diversity in Southeast Asia and the Malesian region. The genus is common, but many species within it are very rare, localized, and endangered endemic plants. The species can be difficult to identify because they are highly polymorphic and because they readily hybridize with each other. The plants may be small herbs, vines, shrubs, epiphytes, or trees. The genus is characterized in part by having two stamens, and most species have white flowers, with a few red-, orange-, yellow-, and pink-flowered species known. Almost all species live in rainforest habitats.It is an example of a supertramp genus.Hawaiian Cyrtandra are known as ha‘iwale.\n\nSpecies\nSelected species include:\n\nCyrtandra aurantiicarpa\nCyrtandra biserrata – Molokai cyrtandra\nCyrtandra calyptribracteata\nCyrtandra cleopatrae\nCyrtandra confertiflora – lava cyrtandra\nCyrtandra cordifolia – the Latin name means cyrtandra with heart-shaped leaves\nCyrtandra crenata – Kahana Valley cyrtandra\nCyrtandra cyaneoides – mapele\nCyrtandra dentata – mountain cyrtandra\nCyrtandra elatostemoides\nCyrtandra elegans\nCyrtandra ferripilosa – red-hair cyrtandra\nCyrtandra filipes – gulch cyrtandra\nCyrtandra garnotiana – hahala\nCyrtandra giffardii – forest cyrtandra\nCyrtandra gracilis – Palolo Valley cyrtandra\nCyrtandra grandiflora – largeflower cyrtandra\nCyrtandra grayana – Pacific cyrtandra\nCyrtandra grayi – Gray's cyrtandra\nCyrtandra halawensis – toothleaf cyrtandra\nCyrtandra hashimotoi – Maui cyrtandra\nCyrtandra hawaiensis – Hawaii cyrtandra\nCyrtandra heinrichii – lava cyrtandra\nCyrtandra hematos – singleflower cyrtandra\nCyrtandra hirtigera\nCyrtandra hypochrysoides\nCyrtandra kalihii – Koolau Range cyrtandra\nCyrtandra kamooloaensis – Kamo'oloa cyrtandra\nCyrtandra kauaiensis – ulunahele\nCyrtandra kealiae\nCyrtandra kealiae ssp. kealiae (syn.

It comprises a single species of tree, Chiranthodendron pentadactylon.\n\nNames\nThe tree is called the devil's, monkey's or Mexican hand tree or the hand-flower in English, the árbol de las manitas (tree of little hands) in Spanish, and mācpalxōchitl (palm flower) in Nahuatl, all on account of its distinctive red flowers, which resemble open human hands. The scientific name means \"five-fingered hand-flower tree\".\n\nDescription\nThis species is native to Guatemala and southern Mexico. On the wet slopes of these areas, trees may reach 10.5–27.5 m (34–90 ft) in height. The unusual appearance of the 'hands' has stimulated cultivation in gardens around the world, primarily in North America where it grows well near its native range. The leaves are large and shallowly lobed, with a brown indumentum on the underside. The distinctive flowers appear in late spring and early summer; the five stamens are long, curved upward, and bright red, giving the distinct impression of a clawed hand. Its fruit is a 7.5–10 cm (3.0–3.9 in) long oblong, five-lobed capsule which contains black seeds.It was originally described from a single cultivated specimen grown in Toluca in the Toluca Valley, well outside the native range. The Aztecs revered the tree.\n\nIntergeneric hybrid\nIt is closely related to Fremontodendron, sufficiently to produce an intergeneric hybrid ×Chiranthofremontia lenzii Henrickson, which has yellow flowers and a reduced form of the claw.\n\nUses\nThe Aztecs and others have used solutions containing the tree's flowers as a remedy for lower abdominal pain and for heart problems. Such solutions also reduce edema and serum cholesterol levels and, because they contain the glycosides quercetin and luteolin, act as diuretics.\nPassage 6:\nZeltnera\nZeltnera is a genus of flowering plants in the gentian family. It was erected in 2004 when the genus Centaurium (the centauries) was split. Genetic analysis revealed that Centaurium was polyphyletic, made up of plants that could be grouped into four clades. Each became a genus. Centaurium remained, but it is now limited to the Eurasian species. The Mexican species now belong to genus Gyrandra, and the Mediterranean and Australian plants are in genus Schenkia. The new name Zeltnera was given to this genus, which contains most of the North American centauries. There are about 25 species.Plants of this genus are annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbs. They are taprooted or have fibrous root systems. They produce one or more branching stems which are often ridged and sometimes winged. The leaves are gathered around the lower stem or arranged along the length of the stem. They vary in shape, from linear to lance-shaped to oval, and are green or yellowish. The inflorescence is variable in arrangement. The flower has a tubular throat that opens into a flat corolla with four or five lobes. It may be any shade of pink or white, and the throat is usually paler, to white or yellowish, or occasionally patterned with green. The fruit is a small capsule containing up to 700 minute seeds. Zeltnera and Centaurium species differ mostly in the morphology of the style and stigma, as well as the shape of the fruit capsule.Zeltnera can be subdivided into three groups, a division which is supported by DNA evidence but is most obvious in terms of geography. They are casually named the \"Californian group\", the \"Texan group\", and the \"Mexican group\". The first group is distributed from British Columbia south through the West Coast of the United States and into Baja California. The \"Texan\" plants occur from Arizona to Oklahoma in the US and throughout northern Mexico. The \"Mexican group\" occurs in Mexico, Central America, and parts of South America. The range may extend north into Arizona.Genus Zeltnera was named for the Swiss botanists Louis and Nicole Zeltner, who have researched Centaurium and other gentians.Species include:\nZeltnera abramsii\nZeltnera arizonica - Arizona centaury\nZeltnera beyrichii - quinineweed\nZeltnera breviflora\nZeltnera calycosa - Arizona centaury, shortflower centaury, rosita, Buckley centaury\nZeltnera davyi - Davy's centaury\nZeltnera exaltata - desert centaury\nZeltnera gentryi\nZeltnera glandulifera - sticky centaury\nZeltnera madrensis\nZeltnera martinii\nZeltnera maryanna - gypsum centaury\nZeltnera muehlenbergii - Muhlenberg's centaury\nZeltnera multicaulis - manystem centaury\nZeltnera namophila - springloving centaury\nZeltnera nesomii\nZeltnera nevadensis\nZeltnera nudicaulis - Santa Catalina Mountain centaury\nZeltnera pusilla\nZeltnera quitensis - Britton's centaury\nZeltnera setacea\nZeltnera stricta\nZeltnera texensis - Lady Bird's centaury\nZeltnera trichantha - alkali centaury\nZeltnera venusta - charming centaury, canchalagua\nZeltnera wigginsii\nPassage 7:\nPsychotria\nPsychotria is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It contains 1,582 species and is therefore one of the largest genera of flowering plants. The genus has a pantropical distribution and members of the genus are small understorey trees in tropical forests. Some species are endangered or facing extinction due to deforestation, especially species of central Africa and the Pacific.\nMany species, including Psychotria viridis, produce the psychedelic chemical dimethyltryptamine (DMT).\n\nSelected species\nFormerly placed here\nPsychotria elata = Palicourea elata\nPsychotria poeppigiana = Palicourea tomentosa\n\nImage gallery\nSee also\nList of the largest genera of flowering plants\nPassage 8:\nTibouchina heteromalla\nPleroma heteromallum, synonyms including Tibouchina grandifolia and Tibouchina heteromalla, known by the common name silverleafed princess flower in English, is a species of evergreen flowering plant in the family Melastomataceae. It is native to French Guiana, Bolivia and Brazil.\n\nDescription\nPleroma heteromallum reaches an average height of 4–6 feet (1.2–1.8 m), with a maximum of about 8–10 feet (2.4–3.0 m) in its native habitat. The branching stem is woody and the large, silvery green leaves are simple, ovate, velvety in texture, and oppositely arranged. The inflorescence is a panicle of several purple flowers with five petals. The plant has 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) long leaves, with prominent veins that are puffed up in the middle and old leaves will often turn an orange color just prior to dropping off.\n\nCultivation\nThe plant is cultivated as an ornamental for its showy foliage and purple flowers. It is sensitive to cold but can tolerate a light frost.\n\nGallery\nPassage 9:\nAureusvirus\nAureusvirus is a genus of viruses, in the family Tombusviridae. Plants serve as natural hosts. There are six species in this genus.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe genus contains the following species:\nCucumber leaf spot virus\nElderberry aureusvirus 1\nJohnsongrass chlorotic stripe mosaic virus\nMaize white line mosaic virus\nPothos latent virus\nYam spherical virus\n\nStructure\nViruses in Aureusvirus are non-enveloped, with icosahedral and  Spherical geometries, and T=3 symmetry. The diameter is around 30 nm. Genomes are linear, around 4.4kb in length.\n\nLife cycle\nViral replication is cytoplasmic, and is lysogenic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by penetration into the host cell. Replication follows the positive stranded RNA virus replication model. Positive stranded RNA virus transcription, using the premature termination model of subgenomic RNA transcription is the method of transcription. Translation takes place by leaky scanning, and  suppression of termination. The virus exits the host cell by tubule-guided viral movement. Plants serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are mechanical, seed borne, and contact.\nPassage 10:\nPothoideae\nPothoideae is a subfamily of flowering plants in the family Araceae.

The population at the 2011 census was 11,894. It is a residential area with two minor industrial estates on either side of the main A56 Chester Road, which divides the two halves of the ward. Gorse Hill Park is a park which has recently had its historic main gates renovated and sits in between the two halves of the ward also, bridging Chester Road and Talbot Road. Gorse Hill is also the northernmost ward of Trafford council and is home to Trafford Town Hall, housing the council offices. Gorse Hill shares a border with the Clifford and Longford wards, and is town is home to two teams; both Manchester United F.C. and Lancashire County Cricket Club.\nPassage 2:\nTrafford Bar tram stop\nTrafford Bar is a tram stop on Greater Manchester's light rail system, Metrolink, at the junction of Talbot Road and Seymour Grove in Old Trafford. It opened on 15 June 1992 as part of Phase 1 of Metrolink's expansion, before which it was a mainline railway station.\n\nHistory\nThe station was opened as Old Trafford on 20 July 1849 by the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway (MSJ&AR). It closed as a British Rail station on 24 December 1991, and the \"Old Trafford\" name was transferred to the former Warwick Road Station, to avoid confusion for passengers travelling to Old Trafford Football Ground and Old Trafford Cricket Ground. It was renamed Trafford Bar when it reopened as a Metrolink station on 15 June 1992. Due to the station's close proximity to Old Trafford football ground it is frequently used on match-days by fans using the East Didsbury – Rochdale service.\n\nService pattern\nAt peak times (07:15 – 19:30 Monday to Friday, 09:30 – 18:30 Saturday):\n\n10 trams per hour to Altrincham\n10 trams per hour to East Didsbury\n5 trams per hour to Bury\n5 trams per hour to Manchester Airport\n5 trams per hour to Piccadilly\n5 trams per hour to Rochdale Town Centre\n5 trams per hour to Shaw and Crompton\n5 trams per hour to VictoriaOffpeak (all other times during operational hours):\n\n5 trams per hour to Altrincham\n5 trams per hour to East Didsbury\n5 trams per hour to Manchester Airport\n5 trams per hour to Piccadilly\n5 trams per hour to Rochdale Town Centre\n5 trams per hour to Victoria\n\nConnecting bus routes\nIt is served nearby by Go North West service 53 to Pendleton via Salford Quays and to Cheetham Hill via the universities, Rusholme, Gorton and Harpurhey.\nStagecoach service 250 to Trafford Centre,\nStagecoach service 255 to Partington via Stretford and Urmston,\nStagecoach service 256 to Flixton via Stretford,\nArriva service 263 to Altrincham Interchange via Stretford and Sale.\nAll these services run to Piccadilly Gardens.\nPassage 3:\nTrojans Rugby Football Club\nThe Trojans Rugby Football Club is an under-nineteen-year-old rugby club originally based out of Lassiter High School. It is one of the original high school rugby clubs which are part of the Georgia High School Rugby Association (GHSRA). The club was founded in 2005, and has made its mark on rugby in Georgia. Matches and practices are held at Noonday Creek Park in Marietta. Coach Randall Joseph has been the head coach since the club's founding, with John Green, Winston Daniels and Michael Murrell as assistant coaches. The club has taken park in many tournaments and state final matches in Georgia and the Southeast United States.  A major goal of the Trojans Rugby Football Club is to teach and play the sport of rugby in the United States. This is a great struggle throughout Georgia because of opposition from the high school's football coaches and athletic directors. The club plays the most common version of rugby, called rugby union but often just referred to as rugby. Although the club plays by rugby union rules, they also play by the rules of the International Rugby Board (IRB) for those under 19 years of age. In the summer of 2011, the Trojan Rugby Football Club took part in another version of rugby called rugby sevens. This variation of rugby is faster paced, with the same size fields but fewer people, and shorter half lengths.\n\nLocation, practices and games\nNoonday Creek Park serves as the Trojans Rugby Football Club's home pitch. Although Lassiter High School is associated with the Trojans Rugby Football Club they do not permit the club to use fields at the school. Noonday Creek Park is located off Shallowford Rd., and at 489 Hawkins Store Rd., NE, Kennesaw, GA, 30144. The park has been part of high school rugby in Georgia since the first game was played there on March 4, 2005. Most practices and all home games for the Trojans take place at this park. Although Fall is the off season, practices currently occur every Wednesday at 4:45pm on field 13. During the formal spring season practices are held on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 5pm and games are typically played on Friday nights.  When the park is closed, practices are held on the field at McCleskey Middle School, located at 4080 Maybreeze Road Marietta, Georgia, 30066.\n\nHistory\nThe Trojans Rugby Football Club began as one of the first three high school rugby teams in Georgia, in 2005. To create these teams the coaches got together and used the graduate thesis, \"The Bryant Model.\" This graduate thesis was written by Phillip C. Bryant, MBA, to provide a manual to starting a high school rugby club. After the first year the Trojans Rugby Football Club had earned a State Championship title for beating Pope High School's team 23-19. By the next season in 2006, the Georgia High School Rugby Association had created two divisions due to the increase in teams. The Trojan Rugby Football Club was placed in the Cobb County Division along with the Pope High School, the Sequoyah High School, and the Campbell High School Rugby Football Clubs. In the 2006 season, the Trojan Rugby Football Club lost all of their games to the other teams in the Cobb County Division. The club entered the 2007 season with growing numbers of new competition and notable performance. At the season's end the Trojans Rugby Football Club had an 11-1 record with the one loss coming from a defeat in the Southeast Tournament, by the Rummel Raiders Rugby Club of New Orleans, Louisiana. The club earned a second State Championship title after defeating the Alpharetta Phoenix Rugby Football Club, and participated in its first Southeast Tournament. In 2008, the club added to their success with yet another State Championship title and traveled to Nashville, Tennessee to play in the 2008 Southeast Tournament. The State Championship match was won in over time against the Alpharetta Phoenix Rugby Football Club with a final score of 17-15. For the second year in a row, the Trojans finished with an 11-1 record, only losing in the Southeast Championship Final match to the Jesuit High School Rugby Club from New Orleans, Louisiana. The 2009 and 2010 carried on their winning traditions by finishing those seasons undefeated in state play, due to Phoenix playing illegal players who were over the age limits during the 2009 and 2010 state title games. In the 2010 season, the Trojans passed up the opportunity to play for the Southeast title and allowed Phoenix to go in their place, Phoenix eventually moved to Nationals. In 2011 the Trojans again took the Georgia Rugby State Champion title from Alpharetta Phoenix. The Trojan Rugby Football Club ended their 2011 spring regular season 8-0 and beat Phoenix Club 55-14 in the State Championship match at Walton High School. The Trojans attended the Southeast Championship in Sanford, Florida the weekend of April 30, 2011. Out of all of the teams attending, the Trojans were seated first overall for the tournament. The morning of Saturday, April 30 the Trojans won their first match against Brother Martin, from Louisiana, 27-0. Later that day the Trojans suffered their first loss of 2011 against Raleigh Rattlesnakes, from North Carolina, 12-26. On Sunday the Trojans lost their final match to the Tampa Barbarians, from Florida, 5-18, earning themselves the sixth-place position of the tournament. In 2016, the Trojans combined with local Pope and Walton high school rugby teams to form \"East Cobb Rugby Club\".\n\nRecord\nTrojans Rugby Football Club Record: 51 matches won and 6 matches lost with no draws.

Previously called Aquinas Old Boys Football Club when it was founded in 1981, the club plays at Aquinas College. The club song is \"We're a team of Champions\", to the tune of \"Join in the Chorus\" .\nThe Bloods won the 1987 and 1996 Grand Finals and have played D1 football.\nAquinas won the Senior and Reserve D4 Premierships in 2017 and will be competing in D3 in 2018.\nPassage 5:\nOld Trafford, Greater Manchester\nOld Trafford () is a football stadium in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, and the home of Manchester United. With a capacity of 74,310 it is the largest club football stadium (and second-largest football stadium overall after Wembley Stadium) in the United Kingdom, and the eleventh-largest in Europe. It is about 0.5 miles (800 m) from Old Trafford Cricket Ground and the adjacent tram stop.\nNicknamed \"The Theatre of Dreams\" by Bobby Charlton, Old Trafford has been United's home ground since 1910, although from 1941 to 1949 the club shared Maine Road with local rivals Manchester City as a result of Second World War bomb damage. Old Trafford underwent several expansions in the 1990s and 2000s, including the addition of extra tiers to the North, West and East Stands, almost returning the stadium to its original capacity of 80,000. Future expansion is likely to involve the addition of a second tier to the South Stand, which would raise the capacity to around 88,000. The stadium's record attendance was recorded in 1939, when 76,962 spectators watched the FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town.\nOld Trafford has hosted an FA Cup Final, two final replays and was regularly used as a neutral venue for the competition's semi-finals. It has also hosted England fixtures, matches at the 1966 World Cup, Euro 96 and the 2012 Summer Olympics, including women's international football for the first time in its history, and the 2003 Champions League Final. Outside football, it has been the venue for rugby league's annual Super League Grand Final every year except 2020, and the final of Rugby League World Cups in 2000, 2013 and 2022.\n\nHistory\nConstruction and early years\nBefore 1902, Manchester United were known as Newton Heath, during which time they first played their football matches at North Road and then Bank Street in Clayton. However, both grounds were blighted by wretched conditions, the pitches ranging from gravel to marsh, while Bank Street suffered from clouds of fumes from its neighbouring factories. Therefore, following the club's rescue from near-bankruptcy and renaming, the new chairman John Henry Davies decided in 1909 that the Bank Street ground was not fit for a team that had recently won the First Division and FA Cup, so he donated funds for the construction of a new stadium. Not one to spend money frivolously, Davies scouted around Manchester for an appropriate site, before settling on a patch of land adjacent to the Bridgewater Canal, just off the north end of the Warwick Road in Old Trafford.Designed by Scottish architect Archibald Leitch, who designed several other stadia, the ground was originally designed with a capacity of 100,000 spectators and featured seating in the south stand under cover, while the remaining three stands were left as terraces and uncovered. Including the purchase of the land, the construction of the stadium was originally to have cost £60,000 all told. However, as costs began to rise, to reach the intended capacity would have cost an extra £30,000 over the original estimate and, at the suggestion of club secretary J. J. Bentley, the capacity was reduced to approximately 80,000. Nevertheless, at a time when transfer fees were still around the £1,000 mark, the cost of construction only served to reinforce the club's \"Moneybags United\" epithet, with which they had been tarred since Davies had taken over as chairman.In May 1908, Archibald Leitch wrote to the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) – who had a rail depot adjacent to the proposed site for the football ground – in an attempt to persuade them to subsidise construction of the grandstand alongside the railway line. The subsidy would have come to the sum of £10,000, to be paid back at the rate of £2,000 per annum for five years or half of the gate receipts for the grandstand each year until the loan was repaid. However, despite guarantees for the loan coming from the club itself and two local breweries, both chaired by club chairman John Henry Davies, the Cheshire Lines Committee turned the proposal down. The CLC had planned to build a new station adjacent to the new stadium, with the promise of an anticipated £2,750 per annum in fares offsetting the £9,800 cost of building the station. The station – Trafford Park – was eventually built, but further down the line than originally planned. The CLC later constructed a modest station with one timber-built platform immediately adjacent to the stadium and this opened on 21 August 1935. It was initially named United Football Ground, but was renamed Old Trafford Football Ground in early 1936. It was served on match days only by a shuttle service of steam trains from Manchester Central railway station. It is currently known as Manchester United Football Ground.Construction was carried out by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester and development was completed in late 1909. The stadium hosted its inaugural game on 19 February 1910, with United playing host to Liverpool. However, the home side were unable to provide their fans with a win to mark the occasion, as Liverpool won 4–3. A journalist at the game reported the stadium as \"the most handsomest [sic], the most spacious and the most remarkable arena I have ever seen. As a football ground it is unrivalled in the world, it is an honour to Manchester and the home of a team who can do wonders when they are so disposed\".Before the construction of Wembley Stadium in 1923, the FA Cup Final was hosted by a number of different grounds around England including Old Trafford. The first of these was the 1911 FA Cup Final replay between Bradford City and Newcastle United, after the original tie at Crystal Palace finished as a no-score draw after extra time. Bradford won 1–0, the goal scored by Jimmy Speirs, in a match watched by 58,000 people. The ground's second FA Cup Final was the 1915 final between Sheffield United and Chelsea. Sheffield United won the match 3–0 in front of nearly 50,000 spectators, most of whom were in the military, leading to the final being nicknamed \"the Khaki Cup Final\". On 27 December 1920, Old Trafford played host to its largest pre-Second World War attendance for a United league match, as 70,504 spectators watched the Red Devils lose 3–1 to Aston Villa. The ground hosted its first international football match later that decade, when England lost 1–0 to Scotland in front of 49,429 spectators on 17 April 1926. Unusually, the record attendance at Old Trafford is not for a Manchester United home game. Instead, on 25 March 1939, 76,962 people watched an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town.\n\nWartime bombing\nIn 1936, as part of a £35,000 refurbishment, an 80-yard-long roof was added to the United Road stand (now the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand) for the first time, while roofs were added to the south corners in 1938. Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, Old Trafford was requisitioned by the military to be used as a depot. Football continued to be played at the stadium, but a German bombing raid on Trafford Park on 22 December 1940 damaged the stadium to the extent that a Christmas day fixture against Stockport County had to be switched to Stockport's ground. Football resumed at Old Trafford on 8 March 1941, but another German raid on 11 March 1941 destroyed much of the stadium, notably the main stand (now the South Stand), forcing the club's operations to move to Cornbrook Cold Storage, owned by United chairman James W. Gibson. After pressure from Gibson, the War Damage Commission granted Manchester United £4,800 to remove the debris and £17,478 to rebuild the stands. During the reconstruction of the stadium, Manchester United played their \"home\" games at Maine Road, the home of their cross-town rivals, Manchester City, at a cost of £5,000 a year plus a percentage of the gate receipts. The club was now £15,000 in debt, not helped by the rental of Maine Road, and the Labour MP for Stoke, Ellis Smith, petitioned the Government to increase the club's compensation package, but it was in vain. Though Old Trafford was reopened, albeit without cover, in 1949, it meant that a league game had not been played at the stadium for nearly 10 years. United's first game back at Old Trafford was played on 24 August 1949, as 41,748 spectators witnessed a 3–0 victory over Bolton Wanderers.\n\nCompletion of the master plan\nA roof was restored to the Main Stand by 1951 and, soon after, the three remaining stands were covered, the operation culminating with the addition of a roof to the Stretford End (now the West Stand) in 1959. The club also invested £40,000 in the installation of proper floodlighting, so that they would be able to use the stadium for the European games that were played in the late evening of weekdays, instead of having to play at Maine Road. In order to avoid obtrusive shadows being cast on the pitch, two sections of the Main Stand roof were cut away. The first match to be played under floodlights at Old Trafford was a First Division match between Manchester United and Bolton Wanderers on 25 March 1957.However, although the spectators would now be able to see the players at night, they still suffered from the problem of obstructed views caused by the pillars that supported the roofs. With the 1966 FIFA World Cup fast approaching, at which the stadium would host three group matches, this prompted the United directors to completely redesign the United Road (north) stand. The old roof pillars were replaced in 1965 with modern-style cantilevering on top of the roof, allowing every spectator a completely unobstructed view, while it was also expanded to hold 20,000 spectators (10,000 seated and 10,000 standing in front) at a cost of £350,000. The architects of the new stand, Mather and Nutter (now Atherden Fuller), rearranged the organisation of the stand to have terracing at the front, a larger seated area towards the back, and the first private boxes at a British football ground. The east stand – the only remaining uncovered stand – was developed in the same style in 1973. With the first two stands converted to cantilevers, the club's owners devised a long-term plan to do the same to the other two stands and convert the stadium into a bowl-like arena. Such an undertaking would serve to increase the atmosphere within the ground by containing the crowd's noise and focusing it onto the pitch, where the players would feel the full effects of a capacity crowd. Meanwhile, the stadium hosted its third FA Cup Final, hosting 62,078 spectators for the replay of the 1970 final between Chelsea and Leeds United; Chelsea won the match 2–1. The ground also hosted the second leg of the 1968 Intercontinental Cup, which saw Estudiantes de La Plata win the cup after a 1–1 draw. The 1970s saw the dramatic rise of football hooliganism in Britain, and a knife-throwing incident in 1971 forced the club to erect the country's first perimeter fence, restricting fans from the Old Trafford pitch.\n\nConversion to all-seater\nWith every subsequent improvement made to the ground since the Second World War, the capacity steadily declined. By the 1980s, the capacity had dropped from the original 80,000 to approximately 60,000. The capacity dropped still further in 1990, when the Taylor Report recommended, and the government demanded that all First and Second Division stadia be converted to all-seaters. This meant that £3–5 million plans to replace the Stretford End with a brand new stand with an all-standing terrace at the front and a cantilever roof to link with the rest of the ground had to be drastically altered. This forced redevelopment, including the removal of the terraces at the front of the other three stands, not only increased the cost to around £10 million, but also reduced the capacity of Old Trafford to an all-time low of around 44,000. In addition, the club was told in 1992 that they would only receive £1.4 million of a possible £2 million from the Football Trust to be put towards work related to the Taylor Report.\nThe club's resurgence in success and increase in popularity in the early 1990s ensured that further development would have to occur. In 1995, the 30-year-old North Stand was demolished and work quickly began on a new stand, to be ready in time for Old Trafford to host three group games, a quarter-final and a semi-final at Euro 96. The club purchased the Trafford Park trading estate, a 20-acre (81,000 m2) site on the other site of United Road, for £9.2 million in March 1995. Construction began in June 1995 and was completed by May 1996, with the first two of the three phases of the stand opening during the season. Designed by Atherden Fuller, with Hilstone Laurie as project and construction managers and Campbell Reith Hill as structural engineers, the new three-tiered stand cost a total of £18.65 million to build and had a capacity of about 25,500, raising the capacity of the entire ground to more than 55,000. The cantilever roof would also be the largest in Europe, measuring 58.5 m (192 ft) from the back wall to the front edge. Further success over the next few years guaranteed yet more development. First, a second tier was added to the East Stand. Opened in January 2000, the stadium's capacity was temporarily increased to about 61,000 until the opening of the West Stand's second tier, which added yet another 7,000 seats, bringing the capacity to 68,217. It was now not only the biggest club stadium in England but the biggest in all of the United Kingdom. Old Trafford hosted its first major European final three years later, playing host to the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final between Milan and Juventus.\nFrom 2001 to 2007, following the demolition of the old Wembley Stadium, the England national football team was forced to play its games elsewhere. During that time, the team toured the country, playing their matches at various grounds from Villa Park in Birmingham to St James' Park in Newcastle. From 2003 to 2007, Old Trafford hosted 12 of England's 23 home matches, more than any other stadium. The latest international to be held at Old Trafford was England's 1–0 loss to Spain on 7 February 2007. The match was played in front of a crowd of 58,207.\n\n2006 expansion\nOld Trafford's most recent expansion, which took place between July 2005 and May 2006, saw an increase of around 8,000 seats with the addition of second tiers to both the north-west and north-east quadrants of the ground. Part of the new seating was used for the first time on 26 March 2006, when an attendance of 69,070 became a new Premier League record. The record continued to be pushed upwards before reaching its current peak on 31 March 2007, when 76,098 spectators saw United beat Blackburn Rovers 4–1, meaning that just 114 seats (0.15% of the total capacity of 76,212) were left unoccupied. In 2009, a reorganisation of the seating in the stadium resulted in a reduction of the capacity by 255 to 75,957, meaning that the club's home attendance record would stand at least until the next expansion.\nOld Trafford celebrated its 100th anniversary on 19 February 2010. In recognition of the occasion, Manchester United's official website ran a feature in which a memorable moment from the stadium's history was highlighted on each of the 100 days leading up to the anniversary. From these 100 moments, the top 10 were chosen by a panel including club statistician Cliff Butler, journalist David Meek, and former players Pat Crerand and Wilf McGuinness. At Old Trafford itself, an art competition was run for pupils from three local schools to create their own depictions of the stadium in the past, present and future. Winning paintings were put on permanent display on the concourse of the Old Trafford family stand, and the winners were presented with awards by artist Harold Riley on 22 February. An exhibition about the stadium at the club museum was opened by former goalkeeper Jack Crompton and chief executive David Gill on 19 February. The exhibition highlighted the history of the stadium and features memorabilia from its past, including a programme from the inaugural match and a 1:220 scale model hand-built by model artist Peter Oldfield-Edwards. Finally, at Manchester United's home match against Fulham on 14 March, fans at the game received a replica copy of the programme from the first Old Trafford match, and half-time saw relatives of the players who took part in the first game – as well as those of the club chairman John Henry Davies and stadium architect Archibald Leitch – taking part in the burial of a time capsule of Manchester United memorabilia near the centre tunnel. Only relatives of winger Billy Meredith, wing-half Dick Duckworth and club secretary Ernest Mangnall could not be found.Old Trafford was used as a venue for several matches in the football competition at the 2012 Summer Olympics. The stadium hosted five group games, a quarter-final and a semi-final in the men's tournament, and one group game and a semi-final in the women's tournament, the first women's international matches to be played there. Since 2006, Old Trafford has also been used as the venue for Soccer Aid, a biennial charity match initially organised by singer Robbie Williams and actor Jonathan Wilkes; however, in 2008, the match was played at Wembley Stadium.\nOn 27 March 2021, Old Trafford hosted its first game of the Manchester United women's team, with West Ham United as the opposition in the Women's Super League. Exactly one year on, Manchester United's women's team face Everton at Old Trafford in front of a crowd for the first time (the 2021 game was behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic). A crowd of 20,241 attended the match, marking the highest home attendance of the women's team, and saw Manchester United come out with a 3–1 victory.On 6 July 2022, Old Trafford hosted the opening match of UEFA Women's Euro 2022 between England and Austria, in front of a record attendance for the Women's European Championships of 68,871 – the second highest women's football attendance in the United Kingdom.Old Trafford was included in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland's shortlist of stadiums to host UEFA Euro 2028 however was not included on the final list of 10.\n\nStructure and facilities\nThe Old Trafford pitch is surrounded by four covered all-seater stands, officially known as the Sir Alex Ferguson (North), East, Sir Bobby Charlton (South) and West Stands. Each stand has at least two tiers, with the exception of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, which only has one tier due to construction restrictions. The bottom tier of each stand is split into Lower and Upper sections, the Lower sections having been converted from terracing in the early 1990s.\n\nSir Alex Ferguson Stand\nThe Sir Alex Ferguson Stand, formerly known as the United Road stand and the North Stand, runs over the top of United Road. The stand is three tiers tall, and can hold about 26,000 spectators, the most of the four stands. It can also accommodate a few fans in executive boxes and hospitality suites. It opened in its current state in 1996, having previously been a single-tiered stand. As the ground's main stand, it houses many of the ground's more popular facilities, including the Red Café (a Manchester United theme restaurant/bar) and the Manchester United museum and trophy room. Originally opened in 1986 as the first of its kind in the world, the Manchester United museum was in the south-east corner of the ground until it moved to the redeveloped North Stand in 1998. The museum was opened by Pelé on 11 April 1998, since when numbers of visitors have jumped from 192,000 in 1998 to more than 300,000 visitors in 2009.\nThe North Stand was renamed as the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand on 5 November 2011, in honour of Alex Ferguson's 25 years as manager of the club. A 9-foot (2.7 m) statue of Ferguson, sculpted by Philip Jackson, was erected outside the stand on 23 November 2012 in recognition of his status as Manchester United's longest-serving manager.\n\nSir Bobby Charlton Stand\nOpposite the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand is the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, formerly Old Trafford's main stand and previously known as the South Stand. Although only a single-tiered stand, the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand contains most of the ground's executive suites, and also plays host to any VIPs who may come to watch the match. Members of the media are seated in the middle of the Upper South Stand to give them the best view of the match. The television gantry is also in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, so the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand is the one that gets shown on television least often. Television studios are located at either end of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, with the club's in-house television station, MUTV, in the East studio and other television stations, such as the BBC and Sky, in the West studio.\nThe dugout is in the centre of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, raised above pitch level to give the manager and his coaches an elevated view of the game. Each team's dugout flanks the old players' tunnel, which was used until 1993. The old tunnel is the only remaining part of the original 1910 stadium, having survived the bombing that destroyed much of the stadium during the Second World War. On 6 February 2008, the tunnel was renamed the Munich Tunnel, as a memorial for the 50th anniversary of the 1958 Munich air disaster. The current tunnel is in the South-West corner of the ground, and doubles as an entrance for the emergency services. If large vehicles require access, then the seating above the tunnel can be raised by up to 25 feet (7.6 m). The tunnel leads up to the players' dressing room, via the television interview area, and the players' lounge. Both the home and away dressing rooms were re-furbished for the 2018–19 season, and the corridor leading to the two was widened and separated to keep the opposing teams apart.On 3 April 2016, the South Stand was renamed the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand before kick-off of the Premier League home match against Everton, in honour of former Manchester United player Sir Bobby Charlton, who made his Manchester United debut 60 years earlier.\n\nWest Stand\nPerhaps the best-known stand at Old Trafford is the West Stand, also known as the Stretford End. Traditionally, the stand is where the hard-core United fans are located, and also the ones who make the most noise. Originally designed to hold 20,000 fans, the Stretford End was the last stand to be covered and also the last remaining all-terraced stand at the ground before the forced upgrade to seating in the early 1990s. The reconstruction of the Stretford End, which took place during the 1992–93 season, was carried out by Alfred McAlpine. When the second tier was added to the Stretford End in 2000, many fans from the old \"K Stand\" moved there, and decided to hang banners and flags from the barrier at the front of the tier. So ingrained in Manchester United culture is the Stretford End, that Denis Law was given the nickname \"King of the Stretford End\", and there is now a statue of Law on the concourse of the stand's upper tier.\n\nEast Stand\nThe East Stand at Old Trafford was the second to be converted to a cantilever roof, following the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand. It is also commonly referred to as the Scoreboard End, as it was the location of the scoreboard. The East Stand can currently hold nearly 12,000 fans, and is the location of both the disabled fans section and the away section; an experiment involving the relocation of away fans to the third tier of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand was conducted during the 2011–12 season, but the results of the experiments could not be ascertained in time to make the move permanent for the 2012–13 season. The disabled section provides for up to 170 fans, with free seats for carers. Old Trafford was formerly divided into sections, with each section sequentially assigned a letter of the alphabet. Although every section had a letter, it is the K Stand that is the most commonly referred to today. The K Stand fans were renowned for their vocal support for the club, and a large array of chants and songs, though many of them have relocated to the second tier of the Stretford End.\nThe East Stand has a tinted glass façade, behind which the club's administrative centre is located. These offices are the home to the staff of Inside United, the official Manchester United magazine, the club's official website, and its other administrative departments. Images and advertisements are often emblazoned on the front of the East Stand, most often advertising products and services provided by the club's sponsors, though a tribute to the Busby Babes was displayed in February 2008 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster. Above the megastore is a statue of Sir Matt Busby, who was Manchester United's longest-serving manager until he was surpassed by Sir Alex Ferguson in 2010. There is also a plaque dedicated to the victims of the Munich air disaster on the south end of the East Stand, while the Munich Clock is at the junction of the East and South Stands. On 29 May 2008, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Manchester United's first European Cup title, a statue of the club's \"holy trinity\" of George Best, Denis Law and Bobby Charlton, entitled \"The United Trinity\", was unveiled across Sir Matt Busby Way from the East Stand, directly opposite the statue of Busby.\nThe Manchester United club shop has had six different locations since it was first opened. Originally, the shop was a small hut near to the railway line that runs alongside the ground. The shop was then moved along the length of the South Stand, stopping first opposite where away fans enter the ground, and then residing in the building that would later become the club's merchandising office. A surge in the club's popularity in the early 1990s led to another move, this time to the forecourt of the West Stand. With this move came a great expansion and the conversion from a small shop to a \"megastore\". Alex Ferguson opened the new megastore on 3 December 1994. The most recent moves came in the late 1990s, as the West Stand required room to expand to a second tier, and that meant the demolition of the megastore. The store was moved to a temporary site opposite the East Stand, before taking up a 17,000 square feet (1,600 m2) permanent residence in the ground floor of the expanded East Stand in 2000. The floor space of the megastore was owned by United's kit sponsors, Nike, who operated the store until the expiry of their sponsorship deal at the end of July 2015, when ownership reverted to the club.\n\nPitch and surroundings\nThe pitch at the ground measures approximately 105 metres (115 yd) long by 68 metres (74 yd) wide, with a few metres of run-off space on each side. The centre of the pitch is about nine inches higher than the edges, allowing surface water to run off more easily. As at many modern grounds, 10 inches (25 cm) under the pitch is an underground heating system, composed of 23 miles (37 km) of plastic pipes. Former club manager Alex Ferguson often requested that the pitch be relaid, most notably half-way through the 1998–99 season, when the team won the Treble, at a cost of about £250,000 each time. The grass at Old Trafford is watered regularly, though less on wet days, and mowed three times a week between April and November, and once a week from November to March.\nIn the mid-1980s, when Manchester United Football Club owned the Manchester Giants, Manchester's basketball franchise, there were plans to build a 9,000-seater indoor arena on the site of what is now Car Park E1. However, the chairman at the time, Martin Edwards, did not have the funds to take on such a project, and the basketball franchise was eventually sold. In August 2009, the car park became home to the Hublot clock tower, a 10-metre (32 ft 10 in)-tall tower in the shape of the Hublot logo, which houses four 2-metre (6 ft 7 in)-diameter clock faces, the largest ever made by the company.The east side of the stadium is also the site of Hotel Football, a football-themed hotel and fan clubhouse conceived by former Manchester United captain Gary Neville. The building is located on the east side of Sir Matt Busby Way and on the opposite side of the Bridgewater Canal from the stadium, and can accommodate up to 1,500 supporters. It opened in the summer of 2015. The venture is conducted separately from the club and was funded in part by proceeds from Neville's testimonial match.\n\nFuture\nIn 2009, it was reported that United continued to harbour plans to increase the capacity of the stadium further, with the next stage pointing to a redevelopment of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, which, unlike the rest of the stadium, remains single tier. A replication of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand development and North-East and North-West Quadrants would see the stadium's capacity rise to an estimated 95,000, which would give it a greater capacity than Wembley Stadium (90,000). Any such development is likely to cost around £100 million, due to the proximity of the railway line that runs adjacent to the stadium, and the corresponding need to build over it and thus purchase up to 50 houses on the other side of the railway. Nevertheless, the Manchester United group property manager confirmed that expansion plans are in the pipeline – linked to profits made from the club's property holdings around Manchester – saying \"There is a strategic plan for the stadium ... It is not our intention to stand still\".In March 2016 (ten years after the previous redevelopment), talk of the redevelopment of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand re-emerged. In order to meet accessibility standards at the stadium, an £11 million investment was made into upgrading its facilities, creating 118 new wheelchair positions and 158 new amenity seats in various areas around the stadium, as well as a new purpose-built concourse at the back of the Stretford End. Increasing capacity for disabled supporters is estimated to reduce overall capacity by around 3,000. To mitigate the reduction in capacity, various expansion plans have been considered, such as adding a second tier to the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, bringing it to a similar height to the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand opposite but without a third level and increasing capacity to around 80,000. Replication of the corner stands on the other side of the stadium would further increase its capacity to 88,000 and increase the number of executive facilities. Housing on Railway Road and the railway line itself have previously impeded improvements to the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, but the demolition of housing and engineering advances mean that the additional tier could now be built at reduced cost.In 2018, it was reported that plans are currently on hold due to logistical issues. The extent of the work required means that any redevelopment is likely to be a multi-season project, due to the need to locate heavy machinery in areas of the stadium currently inaccessible or occupied by fans during match days and the fact that the stand currently holds the changing rooms, press boxes and TV studios. Club managing director Richard Arnold has said that \"it isn't certain that there's a way of doing it which doesn't render us homeless.\" This would mean that Manchester United would have to leave Old Trafford for the duration of the works – and while Tottenham Hotspur were able to use the neutral Wembley Stadium for two seasons while their own new stadium was built, the only stadia of comparable size anywhere near Old Trafford are local rivals Manchester City's City of Manchester Stadium, or possibly Anfield, home of historic rivals Liverpool, neither of which are considered viable.In 2021 United co-chairman Joel Glazer said at a Fans Forum meeting that \"early-stage planning work\" for the redevelopment of Old Trafford and the club's Carrington training ground was underway. This followed \"increasing criticism\" over the lack of development of the ground since 2006. The club is considering tearing down the current stadium and building an entirely new one on the same site, but this is believed to be the \"least likely choice\".\n\nOther uses\nRugby league\nOld Trafford has played host to both codes of rugby football, although league is played there with greater regularity than union. Old Trafford has hosted every Rugby League Premiership Final since the 1986–87 season, in addition to the competition's successor, the Super League Grand Final from 1998.The first rugby league match to be played at Old Trafford was held during the 1924–25 season, when a Lancashire representative side hosted the New Zealand national team, with Manchester United receiving 20 per cent of the gate receipts. The first league match to be held at Old Trafford came in November 1958, with Salford playing against Leeds under floodlights in front of 8,000 spectators.The first rugby league Test match played at Old Trafford came in 1986, when Australia beat Great Britain 38–16 in front of 50,583 spectators in the first test of the 1986 Kangaroo tour. The 1989 World Club Challenge was played at Old Trafford on 4 October 1989, with 30,768 spectators watching Widnes beat the Canberra Raiders 30–18. Old Trafford also hosted the second Great Britain vs Australia Ashes tests on both the 1990 and 1994 Kangaroo Tours. The stadium also hosted the semi-final between England and Wales at the 1995 Rugby League World Cup; England won 25–10 in front of 30,042 fans. The final rugby league international played at Old Trafford in the 1990s saw Great Britain record their only win over Australia at the ground in 1997 in the second test of the Super League Test series in front of 40,324 fans.\n\nWhen the Rugby League World Cup was hosted by Great Britain, Ireland and France in 2000, Old Trafford was chosen as the venue for the final; the match was contested by Australia and New Zealand, and resulted in a 40–12 win for Australia, watched by 44,329 spectators. Old Trafford was also chosen to host the 2013 Rugby League World Cup final. The game, played on 30 November, was won by Australia 34–2 over defending champions New Zealand, and attracted a crowd of 74,468, a world record for a rugby league international. During the game, Australia winger Brett Morris suffered a heavy crash into the advertising boards at the Stretford End, emphasising questions raised pre-match over the safety of Old Trafford as a rugby league venue, in particular the short in-goal areas and the slope around the perimeter. In January 2019, Old Trafford was selected to host the 2021 Rugby League World Cup finals, with the men's and women's matches being played as a double header.Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 was the first year in which Old Trafford did not host the Super League Grand Final due to concerns about having to possibly reschedule the match, which Manchester United were unable to accommodate.\n\nRugby union\nOld Trafford hosted its first rugby union international in 1997, when New Zealand defeated England 25–8. A second match was played at Old Trafford on 6 June 2009, when England beat Argentina 37–15. The stadium was one of 12 confirmed venues set to host matches of the 2015 Rugby World Cup; however, in April 2013 United pulled out of the contract over concerns about pitch quality and not wanting to compromise their relationship with the 13-man code.\n\nOther sports\nBefore the Old Trafford football stadium was built, the site was used for games of shinty, the traditional game of the Scottish Highlands. During the First World War, the stadium was used by American soldiers for games of baseball. On 17 September 1981, the North Section of cricket's Lambert & Butler Floodlit Competition was played there; in the semi-finals, Nottinghamshire defeated Derbyshire and Lancashire beat Yorkshire, before Lancashire beat Nottinghamshire by 8 runs in the final to reach the national final, played between the other regional winners at Stamford Bridge the next day. In October 1993, a WBC–WBO Super-Middleweight unification fight was held at the ground, with around 42,000 people paying to watch WBO champion Chris Eubank fight WBC champion Nigel Benn.\n\nConcerts and other functions\nAside from sporting uses, several concerts have been played at Old Trafford, with such big names as Bon Jovi, Genesis, Bruce Springsteen, Status Quo, Rod Stewart and Simply Red playing. An edition of Songs of Praise was recorded there in September 1994. Old Trafford is also regularly used for private functions, particularly weddings, Christmas parties and business conferences. The first wedding at the ground was held in the Premier Suite in February 1996.\n\nRecords\nThe highest attendance recorded at Old Trafford was 76,962 for an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town on 25 March 1939. However, this was before the ground was converted to an all-seater stadium, allowing many more people to fit into the stadium. Old Trafford's record attendance as an all-seater stadium currently stands at 76,098, set at a Premier League game between Manchester United and Blackburn Rovers on 31 March 2007. Old Trafford's record attendance for a non-competitive game is 74,731, set on 5 August 2011 for a pre-season testimonial between Manchester United and New York Cosmos. The lowest recorded attendance at a competitive game at Old Trafford in the post-War era was 11,968, as United beat Fulham 3–0 on 29 April 1950. However, on 7 May 1921, the ground hosted a Second Division match between Stockport County and Leicester City for which the official attendance was just 13. This figure is slightly misleading as the ground also contained many of the 10,000 spectators who had stayed behind after watching the match between Manchester United and Derby County earlier that day.The highest average attendance at Old Trafford over a league season was 75,826, set in the 2006–07 season. The greatest total attendance at Old Trafford came two seasons later, as 2,197,429 people watched Manchester United win the Premier League for the third year in a row, the League Cup, and reach the final of the UEFA Champions League and the semi-finals of the FA Cup. The lowest average attendance at Old Trafford came in the 1930–31 season, when an average of 11,685 spectators watched each game.\n\nTransport\nAdjacent to the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand of the stadium is Manchester United Football Ground railway station. The station is between the Deansgate and Trafford Park stations on the Southern Route of Northern Rail's Liverpool to Manchester line. It originally served the stadium on matchdays only, but the service was stopped at the request of the club for safety reasons. The stadium is serviced by the Altricham, Eccles, South Manchester and Trafford Park lines of the Manchester Metrolink network, with the nearest stops being Wharfside, Old Trafford (which it shares with the Old Trafford Cricket Ground) and Exchange Quay at nearby Salford Quays. All three stops are less than 10 minutes' walk from the football ground.Buses 255 and 256, which are run by Stagecoach Manchester and 263, which is run by Arriva North West run from Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester to Chester Road, stopping near Sir Matt Busby Way, while Stagecoach's 250 service stop outside Old Trafford on Wharfside Way and X50 service stops across from Old Trafford on Water's Reach. There are also additional match buses on the 255 service, which run between Old Trafford and Manchester city centre. Other services that serve Old Trafford are Arriva's 79 service (Stretford – Swinton), which stops on Chester Road and 245 (Altrincham – Exchange Quay), which stops on Trafford Wharf Road, plus First Greater Manchester service 53 (Cheetham – Pendleton) and Stagecoach's 84 service (Withington Hospital – Manchester), which stop at nearby Trafford Bar tram stop. The ground also has several car parks, all within walking distance of the stadium; these are free to park in on non-matchdays.\nPassage 6:\nMaxine's Tap Room\nMaxine's Tap Room is a historic bar in Fayetteville, Arkansas.\n\nOriginal Bar\nLocated on 107 N. Block Ave. It is one of the oldest bars in Northwest Arkansas. Marjorie Maxine Miller opened the bar in 1950 when she was 24 years old with money she borrowed from her parents. She managed to pay her parents back within the year. In 1963 she tore down the old wooden building in which the bar had been located and had the current building—a long, narrow brick structure—built in its place. The new building had only one window, exactly 8.5 inches (220 mm) by 40 inches (1,000 mm), in the front, which was the minimum size allowed by the building codes at the time. This was more than likely a business decision aimed at limiting break-ins. Other examples of Miller's shrewd business style include keeping a club behind the bar, having only a pay phone available, and trying to hire football players as employees so the team would follow as patrons, a business style that led to the bar's longevity and success. Adding to the Tap Room's charm were a 50-foot (15 m)-long bar that stretched nearly the entire length of the building and dominated the room, an old coin-operated cigarette machine, a juke box that still played 45s, and a deer head adorned with Mardi Gras beads, sunglasses and a tie. Miller was a constant figure behind the cash register for 50 years until her health started to decline around 2000. She died at age 82 in May 2006. A month later the Tap Room caught fire. Due to lack of insurance the bar was closed for over a year, reopening in August 2007. Most of the furniture inside the bar was replaced, including the bar. The exposed rafters darkened by the fire were simply painted black, and a skylight was installed where the roof had burned through. Considerable efforts were made to retain many things that had been in the bar for a very long time, such as the older lights and signs.\n\nCocktail Bar\nIn March 2013 the bar was redeveloped into cocktail lounge under a partnership with Rebekah Champagne (Terra Tots), Matt Champagne (Hammer And Chisel), and Ben Gitchel and Hannah Withers (Little Bread Co.) all Block street businesses. The actual ownership of Maxine's remains in the family in the hands of Maxine's great niece, Andrea Foren.\n.\nPassage 7:\nManchester United F.C. in European football\nManchester United Football Club is an English football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester. They were the first English club to participate in a European competition, entering the European Cup in 1956. Since then, the club has competed in every UEFA-organised competition, with the exception of the now-defunct Intertoto Cup and Conference League.\nThe competition in which Manchester United has had the most success is the European Cup (now known as the UEFA Champions League); they have won three European Cups, the first of which came in 1968; that victory made them the first English club to win the competition. The other two victories came in 1999 and 2008. The club has also won the Europa League in 2017, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1991, the Super Cup also in 1991, the Intercontinental Cup in 1999 and the Club World Cup in 2008.\nAfter their Champions League wins in 1999 and 2008, Manchester United competed as a UEFA representative at the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship and the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup. They were knocked out of the 2000 tournament at the group stage, but went on to win the 2008 edition, highlighted above, becoming the first English side to do so.\n\nHistory\nEarly years\nFollowing their league title win the previous season, Manchester United first competed in European football competition in 1956–57. 1954–55 Football League winners Chelsea had been denied the opportunity to take part in the inaugural European Cup by The Football League's chairman Alan Hardaker, who feared that European football would damage the integrity of the English game. However, Matt Busby, the manager of Manchester United, was a forward-thinking man and was determined to have his team compete on the European stage. With the backing of The Football Association's chairman, Stanley Rous (who would later go on to become the president of FIFA), Manchester United were allowed to compete in the 1956–57 European Cup.\nThe club's first match in European competition was a European Cup preliminary round tie against Anderlecht at Parc Astrid in Brussels; Manchester United won the match 2–0 in front of 35,000 spectators. The return leg was played at Maine Road, the home of Manchester United's local rivals Manchester City, as United's stadium, Old Trafford, had not yet been fitted with the necessary floodlighting for evening games. The match finished as a 10–0 win for Manchester United, a result that still stands as the club's record win in all competitions. A long run in the European Cup followed, including wins over Borussia Dortmund and Athletic Bilbao and culminating with a semi-final tie against Real Madrid. The first leg took United to the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, where they were defeated 3–1 in front of a record away crowd of 135,000 spectators. However, they were only able to draw 2–2 in the second leg back at Old Trafford, and the club's first European season came to an end as Real Madrid went on to record the second of their five consecutive European Cup titles.\n\nMunich\nUnited won the league title again that season, and were therefore eligible to compete in the European Cup for the second consecutive year. After dispatching Shamrock Rovers 9–2 on aggregate in the preliminary round, United were paired with Dukla Prague for the first round. After the second leg in Prague, the team was scheduled to fly back to Manchester the following day, but fog over Manchester prevented this and they were forced to make hasty arrangements to travel back via ferry from the Hook of Holland to Harwich and then by train up to Manchester. This long-winded journey took its toll on the players, who were only able to manage a 1–1 away draw against Birmingham City two days later.\nEager to avoid such a scenario again, the club's management chartered a plane for the quarter-final second leg away to Red Star Belgrade. Following a 2–1 win in the first leg at Old Trafford, a 3–3 draw in Belgrade was enough to secure passage to the semi-finals. On the return flight to Manchester, British European Airways Flight 609 stopped over in a snow-covered Munich for refuelling. Once the refuelling was complete, the pilot was given clearance to take off, only to be halted by a fault with the plane's engine. A second attempt was made a few seconds later, but the same fault kept the plane grounded. Half an hour later, after inspection by the airport's engineers, the plane was given clearance for another take-off attempt. The suggested solution was to have the plane accelerate more slowly, but this meant that the take-off velocity would not be reached until the plane was even further down the runway. Once the plane reached 117 knots – the speed at which it was no longer safe to abort the take-off – the pilot would have expected the plane's velocity to continue to increase; however, there was a sudden drop in velocity and the plane was unable to take off before the end of the runway. It skidded off the end of the runway, through a wire fence and across a road before crashing into a house.\nThe impact of the crash and the subsequent explosion of fuel killed 21 of the 44 people on board instantly, and another two died in hospital a few days later. Eight of those who died were Manchester United players, among them Duncan Edwards, Roger Byrne and Tommy Taylor, while club secretary Walter Crickmer, trainer Tom Curry and coach Bert Whalley were also killed. Matt Busby was also severely injured, but he made a full recovery after two months in hospital. With eight of the club's first team having been killed in the accident, and several more still recuperating, a threadbare side took to the field for the semi-final matches against Milan. A 2–1 win at Old Trafford in the first leg gave the team hope of a place in the final, but a 4–0 defeat back at the San Siro put paid to those dreams. In honour of those who died, UEFA offered United a berth in the 1958–59 European Cup, drawing them against BSC Young Boys in the preliminary round, but the Football League denied United entry to the competition as they had not won the Football League the previous season after their league campaign crumbled in the aftermath of the disaster. The games against Young Boys went ahead as friendlies.\n\nReturn to Europe\nVictory in the 1962–63 FA Cup meant that United returned to European competition after a five-year absence for the 1963–64 Cup Winners' Cup. After sweeping aside Willem II of the Netherlands and the defending champions, England's Tottenham Hotspur, United were drawn against Sporting CP in the quarter-finals. A 4–1 home win in the first leg meant that United needed to avoid defeat by more than three goals at Estádio José Alvalade to progress to the semi-finals; however, the team succumbed to their heaviest defeat in European competition to date, losing 5–0 on the night and 6–4 on aggregate.\nA second-place finish in the league in 1963–64 meant that United qualified for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1964–65. They reached the semi-finals, knocking out Djurgården, Borussia Dortmund, Everton and Strasbourg before losing 2–1 to Ferencváros in a play-off after a 3–3 aggregate draw over two legs.\n\nBack in the European Cup\nThe following season saw United return to the European Cup for the first time since Munich after they had beaten Leeds United to top spot in the Football League on goal average. After seeing off Finland's HJK Helsinki and Vorwärts Berlin of East Germany in the first two rounds, Manchester United were drawn against four-time finalists, two-time winners and the previous season's runners-up, Benfica. Benfica's most famous player, the Portuguese international Eusébio, had just been named the European Footballer of the Year and his team went into the tie as favourites. Despite this tag, United ran out 3–2 winners in the first leg at Old Trafford, before beating the Lisbon side 5–1 back at the Estádio da Luz, in what is considered to be the greatest match of George Best's career. The result set up a semi-final tie with Partizan, a tie that would take United back to Belgrade for the first time since the tragedy in Munich. Best had injured his knee in an FA Cup Sixth Round match against Preston North End a couple of weeks before, and although he played in the first leg against Partizan, he was not fully fit and United struggled, losing 2–0 at the JNA Stadium. A goal from Nobby Stiles secured a 1–0 win in the second leg back at Old Trafford, but it was not enough and Matt Busby, believing that his dream of winning the European Cup was over, considered retirement; however, he resolved to win another league title and have one last shot at Europe's biggest prize.\n\nFirst European title\nManchester United won the 1966–67 Football League title by four points over Nottingham Forest with a game to spare; this secured their second European Cup appearance in three seasons for 1967–68. After overcoming the Maltese champions, Hibernians, in the first round, United were handed yet another trip to Yugoslavia, this time to take on FK Sarajevo. The Red Devils faced a long journey to Sarajevo for the first leg, and they were held to a 0–0 draw in a very physical match. The second leg was equally robust, but United took control of the tie with goals from John Aston and George Best. Sarajevo were only able to pull back one goal and United went through to the quarter-finals, where they were drawn against Polish side Górnik Zabrze. United won the first leg at Old Trafford 2–0; an own goal from Stefan Florenski put them 1–0 up after an hour, and Brian Kidd doubled their lead in the final minute. The Poles had come to be considered one of the better sides in the last eight, and they were able to come away with a 1–0 win in the second leg, but it was not enough to prevent United from progressing to a semi-final tie with Real Madrid. United's 1–0 win in the first leg at Old Trafford was all that separated the sides after a 3–3 draw at the Bernabéu, setting up a meeting with Benfica in the final at Wembley Stadium. Best was again on the scoresheet, along with two goals from Charlton and one from Kidd on his 19th birthday, as United beat the Portuguese champions 4–1 after extra time to claim their first European trophy.\nUnited reached the semi-finals of the European Cup as holders in the 1968–69 season, but lost to Milan. They would not compete in Europe for another seven years.\n\nEuropean comeback\nFollowing the retirement of Sir Matt Busby as manager at the end of the 1968–69 season, United entered a barren period that culminated in relegation to the Second Division in 1974. Promotion was achieved at the first attempt under the management of Tommy Docherty, who had taken over in December 1972, and in that first season back in the top flight, United finished third in the league to qualify for the UEFA Cup.\nAlthough United did qualify for the European Cup Winners' Cup as FA Cup winners in 1977 and for the UEFA Cup in 1980 and 1982 with top-five finishes, they failed to make an impact on European competitions until the 1983–84 season, when they qualified for the European Cup Winners' Cup as FA Cup winners under Ron Atkinson. The United squad of this era was arguably the finest of the post-Busby era, containing star players including Ray Wilkins, Bryan Robson, Frank Stapleton and teenage forward Norman Whiteside. United achieved a famous victory over Barcelona in the quarter-finals of the 1983–84 European Cup Winners' Cup, winning the second leg 3–0 at Old Trafford after being beaten 2–0 in Spain in the first leg, made all the more impressive by the fact that Barcelona's team contained Diego Maradona, rated by many as the best footballer in the world at the time.\nUnited reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup in 1984–85, but this would be their last contribution to European football for half a decade; the subsequent Heysel Stadium disaster at the European Cup final, in which rioting by Liverpool fans resulted in the death of 39 spectators and led to a ban on all English clubs in European competitions which would not be lifted in 1990. This resulted in United missing out on qualification for the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1985, and the UEFA Cup in 1986 and 1988. During this exile from Europe, United replaced Ron Atkinson with Alex Ferguson as their manager, and he remained in charge more than a quarter of a century later.\n\n1990s, 2000s and early 2010s: rise to the European elite and Champions League titles\nWhen the ban on English clubs in European competitions was lifted for the 1990–91 season, United were England's representatives in the European Cup Winners' Cup, as FA Cup winners, and they marked their return to Europe by winning the competition, with a 2–1 win over Barcelona (by now without Maradona) in the final, in which Mark Hughes scored twice. Their defence of the trophy in the 1991–92 season was short-lived, ending at the hands of Atlético Madrid in the second round, and they lost at the first hurdle in the 1992–93 UEFA Cup. League title glory in 1993 saw United enter the European Cup (now branded the Champions League) for the first time in 25 years, but in spite of their excellent domestic form during this era, they failed to make much of an impact in European competitions until the 1996–97 season, when they reached the semi-finals of the Champions League and were beaten by Borussia Dortmund. This campaign in Europe also saw them suffer their first home defeat in a European competition, 40 years after first competing on the continent, losing 1–0 to Turkish side Fenerbahçe in the group stage.They finally ended a 31-year wait for a second European Cup in 1999 when stoppage-time goals from Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær gave them a 2–1 win over Bayern Munich in the final in Barcelona. In 2003–04, United were beaten by Porto in the last 16 of the Champions League, ending a seven-year run of quarter-final appearances in the competitions, which also included one run to the final and a further two to the semi-finals.\nAfter three short-lived Champions League campaigns, United made an impact on the competition in the 2006–07 season. After going down 2–1 in Italy to Roma in the quarter-final first leg, they triumphed 7–1 in the second leg to reach the semi-finals for the first time in five years. They took a 3–2 lead against Milan in the first leg, only for their hopes of an all-English final with Liverpool to be ended by a 3–0 second leg defeat. A year later, however, they won the trophy for the third time, beating fellow English side Chelsea on penalties in Moscow after a 1–1 draw in the first all-English European Cup final.\n\nUnited reached a further two European Cup finals in the next three years, but lost to Barcelona on both occasions: first in the 2009 final in Rome, and then in the 2011 final at the new Wembley Stadium in London. Poor performances in the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League group stage saw United finish third, giving them another chance in Europe via the UEFA Europa League. This was the first time United entered the tournament since its rebrand from the UEFA Cup in 2009, in which they last competed in 1995–96. They were eventually knocked out in the round of 16, losing 5–3 on aggregate to Athletic Bilbao.\n\n2010s and 2020s: decline and resurgence\nAfter finishing seventh in the Premier League in 2013–14 under David Moyes, United missed out on European football in 2014–15 for the first time in 25 years, but returned to European action the following season after Moyes' replacement Louis van Gaal guided the club to fourth in the league and a place in the Champions League play-off round. It was the first time that Manchester United had played in the qualifying phase of the Champions League since beating Hungarian side Debrecen in the 2005–06 competition.By virtue of winning the 2015–16 FA Cup (compounded by a fifth-place finish in the Premier League that season), United started their 2016–17 European campaign in the Europa League, the first time since 1995–96. United won the tournament after defeating Ajax 2–0 in the final, giving them their first win of the competition and becoming the fifth club to win all three of UEFA's major titles. Underperformance in the league has led the club to another Europa League participations in 2019–20, in which United lost to Sevilla in the one-leg semi-final. In the 2020–21 Europa League they lost the final to Villarreal—their first major trophy; United qualified to the competition after a third-place finish in the 2020–21 Champions League group stage, a feat repeated from 2015–16. Since the club last won the league title in 2012–13, they are yet to qualify for the semi-finals of the Champions League. In the 2021–22 Champions League, the Reds topped their group but were knocked out in the round of 16 by Atlético Madrid, losing 1–2 on aggregate. As a result of a sixth-place finish in the 2021–22 Premier League, Manchester United were again qualified for the 2022-23 Europa League. United performed well in the competition, beating Barcelona in the Round of 32 play-offs, but were knocked out by Sevilla 5-2 on aggregate in the quarter-finals.\n\nMatches\nOverall record\nBy competition\nAs of 20 April 2023\n\nBy country\nAs of 20 April 2023\n\nBy club\nAs of 20 April 2023\n\nHonours\nEuropean\nEuropean Cup / UEFA Champions League:\nWinners (3): 1967–68, 1998–99, 2007–08\nRunners-up (2): 2008–09, 2010–11\nUEFA Europa League:\nWinners (1): 2016–17\nRunners-up (1): 2020–21\nUEFA Cup Winners' Cup:\nWinners (1): 1990–91\nUEFA Super Cup:\nWinners (1) 1991\nRunners-up (3): 1999, 2008, 2017\n\nWorldwide\nIntercontinental Cup:\nWinners (1): 1999\nRunners-up (1): 1968\nFIFA Club World Cup:\nWinners (1): 2008\n\nNotes\nPassage 8:\nRagbi Klub Mornar Bar\nRagbi Klub Mornar Bar (Montenegrin:Рагби клуб Морнар Бар, English: Rugby Club Mornar Bar) is a Montenegrin rugby club based in Bar, Montenegro.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nJayayakshya Malla\nJayayakshya Malla (often named  Yaksha Malla for short) (Nepali: यक्ष मल्ल) was the son of Jayajyotir Malla and the last Malla king of the united Kathmandu Valley from around 1428 until his death in 1482. The valley was divided among his sons after his death.\n\nConstruction works\nHe encircled Khowpa Bhaktapur city with moats and defense walls pierced with defense gates and ordered the construction of The Palace of Fifty-five Windows (Bhaktapur's Royal Palace). The palace would later be remodelled by Bhupatindra Malla in the seventeenth centuryHe constructed the Pashupatinath Temple, a replica of the temple by the Bagmati River in Yein Kathmandu and the Siddha Pokhari, a large rectangular water tank located near the main city gate of Khowpa Bhaktapur. He is also credited as the founder of Yaksheswar Temple now standing in the palace complex.\n\nConquests and treaties\nEarly in his reign, he raided south into Mithila, into the State of Bihar and as far as Bengal.  He consolidated control over the trade route to Tibet and captured the Tibetan stronghold of Shelkar Dzong. As a result of his conquests, the boundary of Nepal extended as far as Sikkim in the east, Kerung in the North, Gorkha in the west, and Bihar in the south.After his death in 1482, he was succeeded in Bhaktapur by his son, Raya Malla, and in Kantipur by his son Ratna Malla.\nPassage 2:\nTakayama Tomoteru\nTakayama Tomoteru (高山友照) (1531–1596) was a Japanese samurai of the Azuchi–Momoyama period, who served Matsunaga Hisahide.\nHe was the father of Takayama Ukon, and was a Kirishitan.\nPassage 3:\nAnacyndaraxes\nAnacyndaraxes (Greek: Ἀνακυνδαράξης) was the father of Sardanapalus, king of Assyria.\n\nNotes\n\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed.

Vol. 1. p. 157-158.\nPassage 4:\nArthur Beauchamp\nArthur Beauchamp (1827 – 28 April 1910) was a Member of Parliament from New Zealand. He is remembered as the father of Harold Beauchamp, who rose to fame as chairman of the Bank of New Zealand and was the father of writer Katherine Mansfield.\n\nBiography\nBeauchamp came to Nelson from Australia on the Lalla Rookh, arriving on 23 February 1861.He lived much of his life in a number of locations around the top of the South Island, also Whanganui when Harold was 11 for seven years and then to the capital (Wellington). Then south to Christchurch and finally Picton and the Sounds. He had business failures and was bankrupted twice, in 1879 and 1884. He married Mary Stanley on the Victorian goldfields in 1854; Arthur and Mary lived in 18 locations over half a century, and are buried in Picton. Six of their ten children born between 1855 and 1893 died, including the first two sons born before Harold.Beauchamp represented the Picton electorate from 1866 to 1867, when he resigned.  He had the energy and sociability required for politics, but not the private income then required to be a parliamentarian. He supported the working man and the subdivision of big estates, opposed the confiscation of Māori land and was later recognised as a founding Liberal, the party that Harold supported and was a \"fixer\" for. Yska calls their life an extended chronicle of rootlessness, business failure and almost ceaseless family tragedy and Harold called his father a rolling stone by instinct. Arthur also served on the council of Marlborough Province and is best-remembered for a 10-hour speech to that body when an attempt was made to relocate the capital from Picton to Blenheim.In 1866 he attempted to sue the Speaker of the House, David Monro. At the time the extent of privilege held by Members of Parliament was unclear; a select committee ruled that the case could proceed, but with a stay until after the parliamentary session.\n\nSee also\nYska, Redmer (2017).

He is known as one of the \"Twenty-Four Generals of Takeda Shingen\" \nHe also recorded as having been wounded 41 times in 36 encounters. \nHe was the father of Obata Masamori.\n\nSee also\nIsao Obata\nPassage 7:\nInoue Masaru (bureaucrat)\nViscount Inoue Masaru (井上 勝, August 25, 1843 – August 2, 1910) was the first Director of Railways in Japan and is known as the \"father of the Japanese railways\".\n\nBiography\nHe was born into the Chōshū clan at Hagi, Yamaguchi, the son of Katsuyuki Inoue. He was briefly adopted into the Nomura family and became known as Nomura Yakichi, though he was later restored to the Inoue family.\nMasaru Inoue was brought up as the son of a samurai belonging to the Chōshū fief. At 15, he entered the Nagasaki Naval Academy established by the Tokugawa shogunate under the direction of a Dutch naval officer. In 1863, Inoue and four friends from the Chōshū clan stowed away on a vessel to the United Kingdom. He studied civil engineering and mining at University College London and returned to Japan in 1868. After working for the government as a technical officer supervising the mining industry, he was appointed Director of the Railway Board in 1871. Inoue played a leading role in Japan's railway planning and construction, including the construction of the Nakasendo Railway, the selection of the alternative route (Tokaido), and the proposals for future mainline railway networks.In 1891 Masaru Inoue founded Koiwai Farm with Yanosuke Iwasaki and Shin Onogi.  After retirement from the government, Inoue founded Kisha Seizo Kaisha, the first locomotive manufacturer in Japan, becoming its first president in 1896. In 1909 he was appointed President of the Imperial Railway Association. He died of an illness in London in 1910, during an official visit on behalf of the Ministry of Railways.\n\nHonors\nInoue and his friends later came to be known as the Chōshū Five. To commemorate their stay in London, two scholarships, known as the Inoue Masaru Scholarships, are available each session under the University College London 1863 Japan Scholarships scheme to enable University College students to study at a Japanese University. The value of the scholarships are £3000 each.\n\nHis tomb is in the triangular area of land where the Tōkaidō Main Line meets the Tōkaidō Shinkansen in Kita-Shinagawa.\n\nChōshū Five\nThese are the four other members of the \"Chōshū Five\":\n\nItō Shunsuke (later Itō Hirobumii)\nInoue Monta (later Inoue Kaoru)\nYamao Yōzō who later studied engineering at the Andersonian Institute, Glasgow, 1866-68 while working at the shipyards by day\nEndō Kinsuke\n\nSee also\nJapanese students in Britain\nStatue of Inoue Masaru\nPassage 8:\nCleomenes II\nCleomenes II (Greek: Κλεομένης; died 309 BC) was king of Sparta from 370 to 309 BC. He was the second son of Cleombrotus I, and grandfather of Areus I, who succeeded him. Although he reigned for more than 60 years, his life is completely unknown, apart from a victory at the Pythian Games in 336 BC. Several theories have been suggested by modern historians to explain such inactivity, but none has gained consensus.\n\nLife and reign\nCleomenes was the second son of king Cleombrotus I (r. 380–371), who belonged to the Agiad dynasty, one of the two royal families of Sparta (the other being the Eurypontids). Cleombrotus died fighting Thebes at the famous Battle of Leuctra in 371. His eldest son Agesipolis II succeeded him, but he died soon after in 370. Cleomenes' reign was instead exceptionally long, lasting 60 years and 10 months according to Diodorus of Sicily, a historian of the 1st century BC. In a second statement, Diodorus nevertheless tells that Cleomenes II reigned 34 years, but he confused him with his namesake Cleomenes I (r. 524–490).\n\nDespite the outstanding length of his reign, very little can be said about Cleomenes. He has been described by modern historians as a \"nonentity\". Perhaps that the apparent weakness of Cleomenes inspired the negative opinion of the hereditary kingship at Sparta expressed by Aristotle in his Politics (written between 336 and 322). However, Cleomenes may have focused on internal politics within Sparta, because military duties were apparently given to the Eurypontid Agesilaus II (r. 400–c.360), Archidamus III (r. 360–338), and Agis III (r. 338–331). As the Spartans notably kept their policies secret from foreign eyes, it would explain the silence of ancient sources on Cleomenes. Another explanation is that his duties were assumed by his elder son Acrotatus, described as a military leader by Diodorus, who mentions him in the aftermath of the Battle of Megalopolis in 331, and again in 315.Cleomenes' only known deed was his chariot race victory at the Pythian Games in Delphi in 336. In the following autumn, he gave the small sum of 510 drachmas for the reconstruction of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, which had been destroyed by an earthquake in 373. Cleomenes might have made this gift as a pretext to go to Delphi and engage in informal diplomacy with other Greek states, possibly to discuss the consequences of the recent assassination of the Macedonian king Philip II.One short witticism of Cleomenes regarding cockfighting is preserved in the Moralia, written by the philosopher Plutarch in the early 2nd century AD:\nSomebody promised to give to Cleomenes cocks that would die fighting, but he retorted, \"No, don't, but give me those that kill fighting.\"\nAs Acrotatus died before Cleomenes, the latter's grandson Areus I succeeded him while still very young, so Cleomenes' second son Cleonymus acted as regent until Areus' majority. Some modern scholars also give Cleomenes a daughter named Archidamia, who played an important role during Pyrrhus' invasion of the Peloponnese, but the age difference makes it unlikely.\nPassage 9:\nRatna Malla\nRatna Malla was a Malla king and the first independent king of Kantipur. He was one of the six sons of Yakshya Malla.\n\nReign\nOn the death of his father in 1482, he and his brothers attempted to rule collegially. However, Ratna Malla decided to become an independent ruler and created the Kingdom of Kantipur, with its capital in Kathmandu, in 1484. He was the first Nepalese king to invite Kashmiri Muslim traders to Kathmandu. His elder brother, Raya Malla, was the King of Bhaktapur.Ratna Malla also ruled over Patan for some time and suppressed the rebellion of Thakuri feudatories, and Bhotia with the help of  Kingdom of Palpa. It was during Ratna Malla's rule that the priests from Mithila, and South India started to become prominent in court affairs which was usually the place of Hindu and Buddhist priests. He circulated copper coins using the local copper mines in present-day Chitlang.He ruled for 38 years and was succeeded by his son Surya Malla in 1520 after his death.\nPassage 10:\nJohn Templeton (botanist)\nJohn Templeton (1766–1825) was a pioneering Irish naturalist, sometimes referred to as the \"Father of Irish Botany\". He was a leading figure in Belfast's late eighteenth century enlightenment, initially supported the  United Irishmen, and figured prominently in the town's scientific and literary societies.\n\nFamily\nTempleton was born in Belfast in 1766, the son of James Templeton, a prosperous wholesale merchant, and his wife Mary Eleanor, daughter of Benjamin Legg, a sugar refiner. The family resided in a 17th century country house to the south of the town, which been named Orange Grove in honour of William of Orange who had stopped at the house en route to his victory over James II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.Until the age of 16 Templeton attended a progressive, co-educational, school favoured by the town's liberal, largely Presbyterian, merchant class. Schoolmaster David Manson sought to exclude \"drudgery and fear\" by combining classroom instruction with play and experiential learning. Templeton counted among his schoolfellows brother and sister Henry Joy and Mary Ann McCracken, and maintained a warm friendship with them throughout his life.In 1799, Templeton married Katherine Johnson of Seymour Hill. Her family had been touched by the United Irish rebellion the previous year: her brother-in-law, Henry Munro, commander of the United army at the Battle of Ballynahinch, had been hanged. The couple had five children: Ellen, born on 30 September 1800, Robert, born on 12 December 1802, Catherine, born on 19 July 1806, Mary, born on 9 December 1809 and Matilda on 2 November 1813.\nThe union between the two already prosperous merchant families provided more than ample means enabling Templeton to devote himself passionately to the study of natural history.\n\nUnited Irishman\nLike many of his liberal Presbyterian peers in Belfast, Templeton was sympathetic to the programme and aims of the Society United Irishmen:  Catholic Emancipation and democratic reform of the Irish Parliament. But it was several years before he was persuaded to take the United Irish \"test\" or pledge. In March 1797 his friend, Mary Ann McCracken, wrote to her brother: [A] certain Botanical friend of ours whose steady and inflexible mind is invulnerable to any other weapon but reason, and only to be moved by conviction has at last turned his attention from the vegetable kingdom to the human species and after pondering the matter for some months, is at last determined to become what he ought to have been months ago.\nShe hoped his sisters would \"soon follow him.\" Having committed himself to the patriotic union of Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter, Templeton changed the name of the family home from loyalist Orange Grove to Irish \"Cranmore\" (crann mór, 'big tree').\nTempleton was disenchanted by the Rebellion of 1798, and mindful of events in France , repelled by the violence. He nonetheless withdrew from the Belfast Literary Society, of which he had been a founding member in 1801, rather than accept the continued presence of Dr. James MacDonnell. MacDonnell's offence had been to subscribe forty guineas in 1803 for the capture (leading to execution) of the unreformed rebel Thomas Russell who had been their mutual friend. (While unable to \"forget the amiable Russell\", time, he conceded,  \"softened a little my feelings\": in 1825, Templeton and MacDonnell met and shook hands).\n\nGarden\nThe garden at Cranmore spread over 13-acre garden was planted with exotic and native species acquired on botanical excursions, from fellow botanists, nurseries, botanical gardens and abroad: \"Received yesterday a large chest of East Indian plants which I examined today.\" \"Box from Mr. Taylor\".Other plants arrived, often as seeds from North America, Australia, India, China and other parts of the British Empire  Cranmore also served as a small animal farm.for experimental animal husbandry and a kitchen garden.\n\nBotanist\nJohn Templeton's interest in botany began with this experimental garden laid out according to a suggestion in Rousseau's 'Nouvelle Heloise' and following Rousseau's 'Letters on the Elements of Botany Here he cultivated many tender exotics out of doors (a list provided by Nelson and began botanical studies which lasted throughout his life and corresponded with the most eminent botanists in England Sir William Hooker, William Turner, James Sowerby and, especially Sir Joseph Banks, who had travelled on Captain James Cook's voyages, and in charge of Kew Gardens. Banks tried (unsuccessfully) to tempt him to New Holland (Australia) as a botanist on the Flinders's Expedition with the offer of a large tract of land and a substantial salary. An associate of the Linnean Society, Templeton visited London and saw the botanical work being achieved there. This led to his promotion of the Belfast Botanic Gardens as early as 1809, and to work on a Catalogue of Native Irish Plants, in manuscript form and now in the Royal Irish Academy, which was used as an accurate foundation for later work by succeeding Irish botanists. He also assembled text and executed many beautiful watercolour drawings for a Flora Hibernica, sadly never finished, and kept a detailed journal during the years 1806–1825 (both now in the Ulster Museum, Belfast).[1] Of the 12000 algal specimens in the Ulster Museum Herbarium about 148 are in the Templeton collection and were mostly collected by him, some were collected by others and passed to Templeton. The specimens in the Templeton collection in the Ulster Museum (BEL) have been catalogued. Those noted in 1967 were numbered: F1 – F48. Others were in The Queen's University Belfast. All of Templeton's specimens have now been numbered in the Ulster Museum as follows: F190 – F264; F290 – F314 and F333 – F334.\nTempleton was the first finder of Rosa hibernicaThis rose, although collected by Templeton in 1795, remained undescribed until 1803 when he published a short diagnosis in the Transactions of the Dublin Society.\n\nEarly additions to the flora of Ireland include Sisymbrium Ligusticum seoticum (1793), Adoxa moschatellina (1820), Orobanche rubra and many other plants. His work on lichens was the basis of this secton of Flora Hiberica by James Townsend Mackay who wrote of him The foregoing account of the Lichens of Ireland would have been still more incomplete, but for the extensive collection of my lamented friend, the late Mr. John Templeton, of Cranmore, near Belfast, which his relict, Mrs. Templeton, most liberally placed at my disposal. I believe that thirty years ago his acquirements in the Natural History of organised beings rivalled that of any individual in Europe : these were by no means limited to diagnostic marks, but extended to all the laws and modifications of the living force. The frequent quotation of his authority in every preceding department of this Flora, is but a brief testimony of his diversified knowledge\n\nBotanical Manuscripts\nThe MSS. left by Templeton consist of seven volumes. One of these is a small 8vo. half bound ; it is in the Library of the Royal Irish Academy, and contains 280 pp. of lists of Cryptogams, chiefly mosses, with their localities. In this book is inserted a letter from Miss F. M. More, sister of Alexander Goodman More, to Dr. Edward Perceval Wright, Secretary, Royal Irish Academy, dated March, 1897, in which she says—‘*‘ The Manuscript which accompanies this letter was drawn up between 1794 and 1810, by the eminent naturalist, John Templeton, in Belfast. It was lent by his son, Dr. R. Templeton, to my brother, Alex. G. More, when he was preparing the second edition of the ‘ Cybele Hibernica,’ on condition that it should be placed in the Library of the Royal Irish Academy afterwards.\" The other six volumes are quarto size, and contain 1,090 folios, with descriptions of many of the plants, and careful drawings in pen and pencil and colours of many species. They are now lent to the Belfast Museum. About ten years ago I [Lett]spent a week in examining these volumes, and as their contents have hitherto never been fully described, I would like to give an epitome of my investigation of them.\n\nVol. 1.—Phanerogams, 186 folios, with 15 coloured figures, and 6 small drawings in the text.\nVol. Il.—Fresh-water Algae, 246 folios, 71 of which are coloured.\nVol.IIl.—Marine Algae, 212 folios, of which 79 are coloured figures. At the end of this volume are 3 folios of Mosses, the pagination of which runs with the rest of this volume, but it is evident they had at some time been misplaced.\nVol. IV Fungi, 112 folios.\nVol. V.—Mosses, 117 folios, of which 20 are coloured, and also 73 small drawings in the text. *Vol. VI.—Mosses and Hepatics. 117 folios are Hepatics, 40 of which are in colours ; 96 folios are Mosses, of which 39 are full-page coloured figures; and in addition there are 3 small coloured drawings in the text.All these drawings were executed by Templeton himself, they are every one most accurately and beautifully drawn; and the colouring is true to nature and artistically finished; those of the mosses and hepatics being particularly good. Templeton is not mentioned in Tate’s ‘‘ Flora Belfastiensis,’ published in 1863, at Belfast. The earliest published reference to his MSS. is in the \"* Flora of Ulster,\" by Dickie, published in 1864, where there is this indefinite allusion—‘* To the friends of the late Mr. Templeton I am indebted for permission to take notes of species recorded in his manuscript.\" The MS. was most likely the small volume now in the Royal Irish Academy Library. In the introduction to the \"*‘ Flora of the North-east of Ireland\"’ (1888), there is a brief biographical sketch of Templeton, but no mention of any MS. However, in a ‘‘ Supplement\" to the Flora (1894), there is this note— ‘* Templeton, John, four volumes of his ‘ Flora Hibernica’ at present deposited with the Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society, contain much original matter, which could not be worked out in time for the present paper.\" This fixes the approximate date of the MSS. being loaned to the Belfast Museum. They were not known to the authors of the ‘‘ Cybele Hibernica’\"’ in 1866, while in the second edition (1898) the small volume of the MSS. in R.1.A. Library is described in the Index of Authors under its full title—Catalogue of the Native Plants of Ireland, by John Templeton, A.L.S.\n\nNotable plant finds\nAntrim:Northern beech fern Glenaan River, Cushendall 1809: intermediate wintergreen Sixmilewater 1794: heath pearlwort :Muck Island Islandmagee  1804: dwarf willow Slievenanee Mountain 1809: thin-leaf brookweed beside River Lagan in its tidal reaches – gone now 1797: Dovedale moss Cave Hill 1797: Arctic root Slemish Mountain pre 1825: Cornish moneywort  formerly cultivated at Cranmore, Malone Road, Belfast1 pre-1825 J. persisted to 1947: rock whitebeam  basalt cliffs of the Little Deerpark, Glenarm 15 July 1808: yellow meadow rue Portmore Lough 1800:  Moschatel Mountcollyer Deerpark 2 May 1820 , Bearberry  Fair Head pre 1825, Sea Bindweed Bushfoot dunes pre 1825,  Flixweed , 'Among the ruins of Carrickfergus I found Sisymbrium Sophia in plenty' 2 Sept. 1812 – Journal of J.

He published very little aside from monthly reports on natural history and meteorology in the 'Belfast Magazine' commenced in 1808. John Templeton studied birds extensively, collected shells, marine organisms (especially \"Zoophytes\") and insects, notably garden pest species. He planned a 'Hibernian Fauna' to accompany 'Hibernian Flora'. This was not published, even in part, but A catalogue of the species annulose animals and of rayed ones found in Ireland as selected from the papers of the late J Templeton Esq. of Cranmore with localities, descriptions, and illustrations Mag.

Hist . 1: (n. s.): 403–413 403 -413 were (collated and edited By Robert Templeton). Much of his work was used by later authors, especially by William Thompson whose 'The Natural History of Ireland' is its essential continuation.\n\nDublin\nTempleton was a regular visitor to the elegant Georgian city of Dublin (by 1816 the journey was completed in one day in a wellington coach with 4 passengers) and he was a Member of the Royal Dublin Society.By his death in 1825 the Society had established a Botanic at Glasnevin \"with the following sections:\n1 The Linnaean garden, which contains two divisions, - Herbaceous plants, and shrub-fruit; and forest-tree plants.\n2.

Four acres supplied with both exotic and indigenous plants,the Trinity Library (80,000 volumes) and Trinity Museum.Also the Museum of the College of Surgeons.\n\nDeath and legacy\nNever of strong constitution, he was not expected to survive, he was in failing health from 1815 and died in 1825 aged only 60, \"leaving a sorrowing wife, youthful family and many friends and townsmen who greatly mourned his death\". The Australian leguminous genus Templetonia is named for him.\nIn 1810 Templeton had supported the veteran United Irishman, William Drennan, in the foundation of the Belfast Academical Institution. With the staff and scholars of the Institution's early Collegiate Department, he then helped form the Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society (the origin of both the Botanical Gardens and what is now the Ulster Museum).\nAlthough always ready to communicate his own findings, Templeton did not publish much. Robert Lloyd Praeger (1865-1953), editor of the Irish Naturalist and President of the Royal Irish Academy, described him nonetheless as \"the most eminent naturalist Ireland has produced\".Templeton's son, Robert Templeton (1802-1892), educated at the Belfast Academical Institution (which was eventually to acquire Cranmore House), became an entomologist renowned for his work on Sri Lankan arthropods.

He has published more than 15,000 caricatures in Syrian, Arab and international newspapers. He serves as the head of the Arab Cartoonists Association. In 2011, he received Sakharov Prize for peace. Farzat was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine in 2012.\n\nLife and career\nFarzat was born and raised in the city of Hama, in central Syria on 22 June 1951. At the age of 12, he started publishing drawings professionally on the front pages of al-Ayyam newspaper, shortly before it was banned by the ruling Baath Party. His first cartoon was about the Évian Accords negotiations between Algerians and French officials. In 1969, he began drawing caricatures for the state-run daily, al-Thawra. He enrolled at the Faculty of Fine Arts at Damascus University in 1970, and left before dropping out in 1973. In the mid-1970s, he moved to another government controlled daily, Tishreen, where his cartoons appeared every day. His caricatures were critical of government corruption but were not directed at particular individuals. International recognition followed in 1980 when he won the first prize at the Intergraphic International Festival in Berlin, Germany, and his drawings began to appear in the French newspaper Le Monde. His exhibition in 1989 at the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris, France led to a death threat from Saddam Hussein, and a ban from Iraq, Jordan and Libya. The drawing that brought about the most controversy was called The General and the Decorations which showed a general handing out military decorations instead of food to a hungry Arab citizen.Farzat met Syrian president Bashar al-Assad prior to his presidency in 1996. According to Farzat, \"He [Bashar] actually laughed at some of the cartoons—specifically at those targeting security personnel—he had a bunch of them with him and he turned to them and said: 'Hey, he is making fun of you. What do you think?\" Afterward the two developed a friendship. In December 2000, Farzat started publishing al-Domari (Arabic: الدومري, lit. 'The Lamplighter'), which was the first independent periodical in Syria since the Baath Party came to power in 1963. The newspaper was based on political satire and styled in a similar way to the French weekly Le Canard enchaîné. The first issue of the paper came out in February 2001 and the entire 50,000 copies were sold in less than four hours. In 2002, he won the prestigious Dutch Prince Claus Award for \"achievement in culture and development\". By 2003, however, frequent government censorship and lack of funds forced Farzat to close down al-Domari. He has been called \"one of the most famous cultural figures in the Arab world\". In December 2012, Farzat was awarded Gebran Tueni prize in Lebanon.\n\nSyrian Civil War\nDuring the ongoing Syrian Civil War, Farzat had been more direct in his anti-government cartoons, specifically targeting government figures, particularly al-Assad. Following the fall of Tripoli in late August to anti-government rebels seeking to topple Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi, Farzat published a cartoon depicting a sweaty Bashar al-Assad clutching a briefcase running to catch a ride with Gaddafi who is anxiously driving a getaway car. Other cartoons Farzat published previously include one where al-Assad is whitewashing the shadow of large Syrian security force officer while the actual officer remains untouched with the caption reading \"Lifting the emergency law\" and another showing al-Assad dressed in a military uniform flexing his arm in front of a mirror. The mirror's reflection shows Assad being a dominant muscular figure contrasting with his actual slim stature.On 25 August 2011, Farzat was reportedly pulled from his vehicle in Umayyad Square in central Damascus by masked gunmen believed to be part of the security forces and a pro-government militia. The men assaulted him, focusing mainly on his hands, and dumped him on the side of the airport road where passersby found him and took him to a hospital. According to one of his relatives, the security forces notably targeted his hands with both being broken and then told Farzat it was \"just a warning\". His brother As'aad, however, claims Farzat was kidnapped from his home around 5 am by five gunmen and then taken to the airport road after being beaten \"savagely\". The gunmen then warned him \"not to satirize Syria's leaders\". The Local Coordination Committee (LCC), an activist group representing the rebellion in Syria, stated that his briefcase and the drawings in them were confiscated by the assailants.In response to news of Farzat's ordeal, Syrian opposition members expressed outrage and several online activists changed their Facebook profile picture with that of a hospitalized Farzat in solidarity with the cartoonist. The incident provoked an outpouring of solidarity by cartoonists in the Arab world and internationally. Egyptian Al Sharouk's Waleed Taher had drawn a map of the Arab world with a face emerging out of Syria screaming \"They beat up Ali Farzat, World!\" Egypt's Al Masry Al Youm published a cartoon depicting a man with two amputated hands, taken aback by how another person guessed that he was a cartoonist. In the Lebanese daily Al Akhbar Nidal al-Khairy published a cartoon depicting Farzat's broken hand being stabbed by three security men smaller than the hand in size with the caption reading \"The hands of the people are above their hands.\" Well-known Carlos Latuff of Brazil drew a rifle with a pen as its barrel pursuing a frantic al-Assad.The United States condemned the attack calling it \"targeted, brutal\". According to the BBC's Arab affair's analyst, Farzat's beating is a sign that the Syrian authorities \"tolerance for dissent is touching zero.\" One month earlier, Ibrahim al-Qashoush, the alleged composer of a popular anti-government song, was found dead with his vocal cords removed.Following the attack Farzat stated that he would not meet with al-Assad any longer, although he was not sure if al-Assad directly ordered the assault against him. Farzat said he would continue to criticize al-Assad, stating \"I was born to be a cartoonist, to oppose, to have differences with governments that do these bad things. This is what I do.\"\n\nStyle\nFarzat's drawings are centred around themes involving criticism of bureaucracy, corruption and hypocrisy within the government and the wealthy elite. His drawings, typically without captions, are noted for their scathing criticism and for depicting types rather than individuals. Through his cutting caricatures he gained the respect of many Arabs while drawing the ire of their governments. However, since the uprising in Syria began Farzat has been more direct in his caricatures, depicting actual figures including the President of Syria, Bashar al-Assad.\n\nCollections\nA Pen of Damascus Steel: The Political Cartoons of an Arab Master (2005) Published by Cune Press www.cunepress.com\nPassage 3:\nAlireza Jamshidi\nDr Alireza Jamshidi (or Ali-Reza Jamshidi) is an official spokesman for Iran's judiciary, headed by Mahmoud Shahroudi. In that capacity, he holds regular news conferences. As he has little other public presence, his name is associated mainly with stories he has promulgated:\n\nImprisonment of members of the Baháʼí Faith because of their religionProsecution of doctors carrying out HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention programs, apparently because of links with the United StatesExecutions of juvenile offenders such as that of Mohammad Hassanzadeh for a crime committed at the age of fourteen years.Denial of punishments such as stoning, which he claimed were falsely attributed to Iran by Western media\nCapital punishment for “insulting religious sanctities and laws, and homosexuality.”\nPassage 4:\nAbu Luqman\nAli Moussa Al-Shawakh, (1973 –17 April 2018) known by his kunya Abu Luqman, Abu Ayyub al-Ansari or Ali al-Hamoud, was a Syrian man and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant governor of Raqqa, Syria as of July 2015. He used to be governor of Aleppo province.\n\nHistory\nAbu Luqman was born in as-Sahl village in Raqqa province. He studied law at the University of Aleppo. He is from the Ajeel clan of Raqqa. It is claimed he used to have a Sufi orientation because he followed Mahmud al-Aghasi (known as Abu Qaqa) who was the leader of Ghuraba al-Sham.\nHe was freed from Sednaya Prison, Damascus in the summer of 2011 by President Bashar al-Assad, at the outset of the uprising against the Syrian government.\n\nISIL activity\nAccording to Ibrahim Muslem, a human-rights activist quoted by The Wall Street Journal, \"Abu Luqman decides who gets the oil\". At Mr. Luqman's discretion, smugglers pay for fuel and load it into tanker trucks. Refined products from the Akrish refinery are driven more than 200 miles to Syrian villages near the Turkish border, according to Mr. Muslem.\nMohammed al-Saleh, a spokesman for the advocacy group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, quoted in The Wall Street Journal, said Abu Luqman replaced several foreign generals with locals after the loss of the town of Tell Abyad.\nHe was also responsible for the execution of Abu Saad al-Hadram, Jabhat al-Nusra's commander for Raqqa province.\n\n2014\nIn early 2014, he was ISIL's chief interrogator in Raqqa province. As of April 2014, he was the IS emir of Raqqa province. In this role, he was the primary official responsible for appointing other ISIL leaders, distributing fighters among the various IS fighting fronts, and publicizing ISIL military operations. In mid-2014, he ordered the beheading of two hostages held by ISIL.\nAs of late 2014, he was a member of ISIL's eight-member governing council. His responsibilities for ISIL included frequently traveling across Syria to transfer ISIL prisoners. Also in late 2014, he changed his name when he was reported dead in the press as a security measure.\n\n2015\nIn early 2015, he  was a member of an ISIL governance council chaired by IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. As of early 2015, he was the senior figure in charge of ISIL detention of Western hostages.In June 2015, he was the governor of Aleppo and the security emir for Syria responsible for foreign fighters. Previously as governor of Raqqa, he was responsible for executions. In July 2015, he was reappointed governor of Raqqa and was the de facto chief in Raqqa, overseeing security affairs. As of mid-2015, he was ISIL's overall security amir at a Raqqa detention facility holding more than 1,000 ISIL foreign recruits who had refused to fight.\n\nUS and UN sanctions\nOn 29 September 2015 he was added to the United States Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control Specially Designated Nationals List.The US Department of Treasury further describes his role, saying \"Al-Shawakh is being designated for acting for or on behalf of ISIL, an entity designated pursuant to E.O. 13224. As of mid-2015, Syrian national al-Shawakh served as ISIL’s governor for Raqqa, Syria, after having served as ISIL’s senior security official for Syria and as governor in Aleppo, roles in which he directed combat assignments for foreign fighters.   Al-Shawakh was in charge of ISIL’s detention of foreign hostages, and oversaw the appointment of other ISIL leaders.  Al-Shawakh supervised security matters, including executions, interrogations, and transfers of ISIL prisoners, at an Raqqa detention facility used to hold foreign hostages and ISIL foreign recruits who had refused to fight.  In mid-2014, al-Shawakh ordered the beheadings of two ISIL hostages.  Al-Shawakh also served on a governance council chaired by ISIL leader and U.S. and UN-designated SDGT Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (AKA Dr. Ibrahim al-Badri)\".He is also sanctioned by the United Nations who said, \"Ali Musa al-Shawakh was listed on 29 February 2016 pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 4 of resolution 2161 (2014) as being associated with Al-Qaida for “participating in the financing, planning, facilitating, preparing, or perpetrating of acts or activities by, in conjunction with, under the name of, on behalf of, or in support of” the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), listed as Al-Qaida in Iraq (QDe.115)\".\n\nDeath\nAbu Luqman was reportedly killed by an Iraqi airstrike on 17 April 2018.\nPassage 5:\nAli Loke\nAli Loke (née Hemingway) (born 26 May 1993 in Stevenage) is a Welsh professional squash player. She has competed in the main draw of multiple professional PSA tournaments. As of April 2019, she was ranked number 77 in the world and was the 2nd-highest internationally ranked player in Wales.\nPassage 6:\nSultan Buyung\nSultan Buyung or Ali Ri'ayat Syah II (died 28 June 1589) was the ninth sultan of Aceh in northern Sumatra. He had a short and contested reign from 1585/85 to 1589, ending with his violent demise.\n\nIndrapura origins\nSultan Buyung did not belong to the sultan's family of Aceh but originated from Indrapura on the west coast of Sumatra. His background is known from epigraphic data: he was the son of Munawwar Syah, son of Muhammad Syah, son of Almalik Zainuddin. This indicates that Indrapura had been ruled by a Muslim dynasty since at least 1500. The sister of Sultan Buyung, Raja Dewi, was married to Sultan Mughal alias Sri Alam who was sultan of Aceh for a brief period in 1579. At a time the prince went to Aceh to be with his widowed sister. When he had stayed there for two months the current sultan Alauddin Mansur Syah was murdered. This happened in early 1585 according to the chronicles but in 1586 according to a Portuguese account.\n\nContested reign\nAfter the murder of Alauddin Mansur Syah, Sultan Buyung was raised to the throne with the throne name Sultan Ali Ri'ayat Syah. The precise reasons why he was selected are not known to us, but there was apparently a lack of grown-up candidates. The old sultan left a young grandson, Raja Asyem, who may have been supported by part of the orang kayas (grandees) but was too young to reign. Raja Asyem was protected by an old military of humble background, the later sultan Alauddin Ri'ayat Syah Sayyid al-Mukammal who had allegedly murdered the boy's grandfather. Thus Aceh appears to have been politically divided during Sultan Buyung's brief reign. Of political events, we only know that the hostilities with the Portuguese in Melaka ceased in his reign. Relations between the Portuguese and the leading Malay kingdom Johor deteriorated after 1585 and the Johorese suffered a disastrous military defeat in 1587. As a consequence of this an Acehnese envoy appeared in Melaka and a peace was concluded. The result of all this was that the sea-roads between the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra became free and trade expanded greatly. The peace held on for the next 19 years. Finally, the sultan was murdered under unclear circumstances on 28 June 1589 by \"all the grandees\" of the kingdom. Thus he was the fourth ruler in succession to be killed. The throne was now taken by Alauddin Ri'ayat Syah Sayyid al-Mukammal, who claimed descent from the 15th-century rulers of Aceh. His accession made an end to ten years of violent political infighting.\nPassage 7:\nAlbertus Seba\nAlbertus or Albert Seba (May 12, 1665, Etzel near Friedeburg – May 2, 1736, Amsterdam) was a Dutch pharmacist, zoologist, and collector. Seba accumulated one of the largest cabinets of curiosities in the Netherlands during his time. He sold one of his cabinets in 1717 to Peter the Great of Russia. His later collections were auctioned after his death. He published descriptions of his collections in a lavishly illustrated 4 volume Thesaurus. His early work on taxonomy and natural history influenced Linnaeus.\n\nCareer\nBorn in Etzel, Seba moved to Amsterdam as an apprentice and, around 1700, opened a pharmacy near the harbour. Seba asked sailors and ship surgeons to bring exotic plants and animal products he could use for preparing drugs. Seba also started to collect snakes, birds, insects, shells, and lizards in his house.\nFrom 1711, he delivered various medicines to the Russian court in Saint Petersburg and sometimes accepted fresh ginger as payment. Seba promoted his collection to Robert Erskine (1674–1719), the tsar's head physician, and in early 1716 Peter the Great bought the complete collection. In the following several years, Seba managed to develop another collection of natural specimens, which grew more extensive than the first.\nThrough Seba, Frederik Ruysch—a well-known Amsterdam physician and anatomist—also sold his collection to the tsar. Both collections so expanded Peter's imperial cabinet of curiosities that they led to the establishment of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the construction of a new building for the Kunstkammer, opened in 1728 as the first Russian public museum.In October 1728, Seba had become a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1734, he had published a Latin \"treasury\" (thesaurus) of animal specimens with beautiful engravings. Its full title was Locupletissimi Rerum Naturalium Thesauri Accurata Descriptio et Iconibus Artificiosissimus Expressio per Universam Physices Historiam (\"A Careful Description and Exceedingly Artistic Expression in Pictures of the Exceedingly Rich Treasury of Nature Throughout the Entire History of Natural Science\"), traditionally shortened and abbreviated in Latin as the Rerum Naturalium Thesaurus (\"A Treasury of Nature\") or as Seba's Thesaurus. A traditional English version of the name has been A Cabinet of Natural Curiosities, after the early modern cabinets of curiosities. The last two of the four volumes were published after his death (1759 and 1765). Today, an original 446-plate volume is in the collection of the Koninklijke Bibliotheek in The Hague, Netherlands. Recently, a complete example of the Thesaurus sold for $460,000 at an auction. In 2001, Taschen Books published a reprint of the Thesaurus, with a second printing in 2006.In 1735, Carl Linnaeus visited Seba twice. Linnaeus found Seba's collection to be useful for the classification system which Linnaeus was developing, and Linnaeus used many of Seba's specimens as holotypes for original descriptions of species. Seba's inclusion of fantastic beasts such as the hydra influenced Linnaeus to include the \"Paradoxa\", species which may exist but which have not been found, in his Systema Naturae.Seba himself did not use Linnaeus' taxonomy, as it was published only a year before his death. However, he did organize his Thesaurus by physical similarities, leading to some similarities with Linnaeus' larger project.In 1752, several years after Seba's death, his second collection was auctioned in Amsterdam. Several objects were purchased by Russia's Academy of Sciences.\n\nTaxa named in honor of Seba\nSeba is commemorated in the scientific names of two species and one subspecies of snakes: Ninia sebae, Python sebae, and Oxyrhopus petola sebae.\n\nGallery\nPassage 8:\nAli Elmusrati\nAlmoatasembellah Ali Mohamed Al-Musrati (Arabic: المعتصم بالله علي محمد المصراتي; born 6 April 1996), known simply as Al-Musrati, is a Libyan professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Primeira Liga club Braga and the Libya national team.\n\nClub career\nVitória de Guimarães\nReserve team\nIn January 2017, he signed a three-and-a-half-year deal at Vitória de Guimarães of Portugal's Primeira Liga, on the recommendation of their former player Romano Sion. He began playing for their reserve team in LigaPro, and on 4 March 2018 scored his first goal to equalise in a 1–1 draw away to União.\n\nFirst team\nOn 5 August 2019, Al-Musrati made his debut for the first team, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1–0 win at Feirense in the second round of the Taça da Liga. Thirteen days later he made his Primeira Liga debut in a 1–1 home draw with Boavista and was third-place in the vote for the league's best midfielder of the month, behind Bruno Fernandes and Pizzi. On 12 December, he scored his only goal for the first team, equalising in a 3–2 comeback win at Eintracht Frankfurt in the group stage of the UEFA Europa League; his club was already eliminated.\n\nLoan to Rio Ave\nAl-Musrati was loaned to Rio Ave of the same league on 29 January 2020, for the rest of the season. He, Diogo Figueiras and Nuno Santos were sent off on 17 June in a 2–1 home loss to Benfica.\n\nBraga\nOn 31 July 2020, Al-Musrati signed a four-year deal at Braga, joining his former Rio Ave manager Carlos Carvalhal. His first goal was on 26 November, to open a 3–3 home draw with Leicester City in the Europa League group stage; three days later he struck for the first time in the top flight to win at the Estádio Municipal de Braga against Farense. He was voted the league's Player of the Month for February 2021.\n\nInternational career\nAl-Musrati was first called up for Libya at the 2014 African Nations Championship in South Africa, and played all but one game including the penalty shootout win over Ghana in the final.\n\nCareer statistics\nClub\nAs of match played 4 June 2023\n\nInternational\nAs of match played 28 March 2023\n\nInternational goals\nScores and results list Libya's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Elmusrati goal.\n\nHonours\nBraga\n\nTaça de Portugal: 2020–21Libya\n\nAfrican Nations Championship: 2014\nPassage 9:\nAli Dinar\nAli Dinar (Arabic: علي دينار; 1856 – November 6, 1916) was a Sultan of the Sultanate of Darfur and ruler from the Keira dynasty.  \nIn 1898, with the decline of the Mahdists, he managed to regain Darfur's independence.\n\nA rebellion led by him in 1915—in the context of his giving his support to the Ottoman Empire during the First World War— led the British government to dispatch the Anglo-Egyptian Darfur Expedition, in which he was killed in action, after which his Sultanate was incorporated into the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium.\n\nFurther reading\n'Alī Dīnār, Last Sultan of Darfur, 1898–1916\nPassage 10:\nMohammad Jahromi\nMohammad Jahromi (born 1958) is a former Iranian governor and politician who served as minister of labor and social affairs from 2005 to 2009.\n\nEarly life and education\nJahromi was born in Tehran in 1958. He holds a bachelor's degree in mathematics. He also received a PhD in strategic management.\n\nCareer\nJahromi was the deputy chairman for executive affairs of the Guardian Council. He was also one of the founding members of the IRGC in the provinces of Gilan and Mazandaran in 1979. He acted as an IRGC commander in Noor. In addition, he served as the governor of different provinces, including Zanjan (1982-1984), Lorestan (1984-1989) and Semnan (1984-1999). He was among the members of secretariat of the State Expediency Council.On 24 August 2005, he became the minister of labor and social affairs in the first cabinet of Mahmoud Ahmedinejad. He was approved by the Majlis with 197 votes in favor. During his tenure, he was considered to be the economic spokesperson of the government.

Smith\nLarkin Irvin Smith (June 26, 1944 – August 13, 1989) was an American Congressman from Mississippi serving for seven months until he was killed in a plane crash in Perry County, Mississippi in 1989.\nSmith was born in Poplarville, Mississippi to Nona Orene Bounds and her husband Hezekiah K. Smith, Sr. Smith was named after his maternal grandfather Larkin Bounds and his maternal uncle Irvin E. Bounds. He received his bachelor's degree from William Carey University and then served at various positions in the police forces in both Pearl River and then Harrison counties. He became the police chief in Gulfport and thereafter the Harrison County sheriff.\nIn 1988, Smith ran for the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican from Mississippi's 5th congressional district in the southern portion of the state after eight-term incumbent Trent Lott gave up the seat to make a successful run for the Senate.\nHe defeated Democratic State Senator Gene Taylor and took office on January 3, 1989. However, Smith died on the night of August 13 in a plane crash in rural Perry County near Gulfport after returning from opening the Little League baseball \"Dixie Youth World Series\" in Hattiesburg. The bodies of Smith and pilot Chuck Vierling were not recovered until the next morning after a search in which rescuers had to bulldoze their way through the forest. Smith's death came only six days after fellow Representative Mickey Leland of Texas died in a plane crash in Ethiopia on August 7, 1989.\nTaylor would succeed Smith in a special election held some two months after the crash, beating Republican candidate Tom Anderson. Taylor was reelected every two years until 2010, when he was defeated by Republican State Representative Steven Palazzo.\n\nSee also\nList of United States Congress members who died in office (1950–99)\nPassage 2:\nThe Darling Buds of May (TV series)\nThe Darling Buds of May is a British comedy drama television series, produced by Yorkshire Television for the ITV network, first broadcast between 7 April 1991 and 4 April 1993. The first six episodes of Series 1 and the first two of Series 2 are adaptations of the 1958 novel of the same name, and three of its four sequels, by H. E. Bates.  The remaining episodes are original storylines based on the same format.\nSet in rural 1950s Kent, it follows the life of the Larkin family. It starred David Jason as \"Pop\" Larkin alongside Pam Ferris as \"Ma\" Larkin, with Catherine Zeta-Jones playing their eldest daughter Mariette, who marries tax inspector Cedric \"Charley\" Charlton, played by Philip Franks. A ratings success, it was Zeta-Jones's breakout role.\nFeaturing a total of 20 episodes, it was broadcast as three series of six double-episode story lines in the spring of 1991, 1992 and 1993, plus two single-episode Christmas specials aired in 1991 and 1992.\nThe title is from the third line of Shakespeare's sonnet 18.\n\nSynopsis\nThe Larkin family lives on a farm in rural England, in the county of Kent. Sidney (\"Pop\") and his common law wife Florence (\"Ma\") have six children, eldest daughter Mariette, followed by their only son Montgomery, and other daughters Primrose, twins Zinnia and Petunia, and Victoria. Ma is a housewife while Pop supplements his farm income with various other not entirely legitimate enterprises. Tax collector Cedric (\"Charley\") visits to audit Pop, but falls in love with Mariette and quits his job to live the rural life. As Ma and Pop raise their other children, Charley attempts to provide for his now wife Mariette. Ma and Pop soon have a seventh child, Oscar, followed around a year later by Charley and Mariette's first baby, John Blenheim.\nPop and Ma's relationship is depicted as loving and affectionate throughout, although Pop is flirtatious and subject to numerous advances, most of which Ma is aware of and evidently unconcerned by. Proud of all his children, Pop's schemes evidently provide well for the family, enough to fund boarding school for the twins, naval boarding school for Monty, a swimming pool, a fairground, and a holiday to France, although he is just as motivated by doing good and helping others as making a profit. Ma occasionally becomes involved in Pop's schemes, or creates a scheme of her own. Possessing some very close friends, their lifestyle, in particular the fact they have never been married, nonetheless raises eyebrows in the stuffy environs of the local village.\nMariette and Charley's relationship is more torrid, in part due to his insecurity over Mariette being so attractive, and Charley's varying success in providing financially, with their newly acquired hop garden struggling. Mariette's business skills eventually come to bear as they purchase a local brewery. Primrose is depicted as a frustrated romantic, moving to France to live with a boy her own age and attempting to seduce both Charley and the village minister upon her return. Monty meanwhile contends with bullying, both at home and at naval boarding school. The increasingly mischievous twins gradually grow apart from their younger sibling Victoria, who delights in teasing and embarrassing all her siblings, especially Primrose.\n\nPeriod\nAll the episodes are seemingly set during 1958–59, despite the timespan of events across all three series making this a logical impossibility. The first serial is based on the first book, written and set in 1958, during which Florence finds out she is pregnant. In the second serial (\"When the green woods laugh\") Sidney is accused of committing indecent assault on 23 August 1958, with the trial taking place on the same day as Charley and Mariette's wedding. The date of the trial is given as 7 July; this would seem to be a continuity error, because it cannot be July of the following year, as Florence's baby had not yet been born. By the time of the third serial (\"A breath of French air\"), Florence has already given birth to Oscar, and the Larkins have a late-August holiday in Brittany, during which Charley and Mariette celebrate their first wedding anniversary. The fourth serial (\"Christmas is coming\") is set at Christmas, and it is established Mariette is five months pregnant; she gives birth in the fifth serial (\"Oh! to be in England!\"), which would be some time in the spring of 1960 at the earliest, according to the dating of the first series and the chronology of events up to that point.\nHowever, in the sixth serial (\"Stranger at the gates\") the twins celebrate their birthday, which a close-up of a wall calendar reveals to be 15 August 1959. In the eighth serial (\"Le Grand Weekend\"), the Larkins' weekend getaway coincides with Charles de Gaulle's state visit, which would date the events of the episode to April 1960, if it does indeed coincide with the real-life visit. Primrose's birthday was revealed to be in May in \"Stranger at the gates\", and she celebrates it in the ninth serial, \"The happiest days of your life\", dating the events either to May 1960 (using the retconned second series date) or 1961 (going by the date given in the first series).\nBy the eleventh serial (\"Climb the greasy pole\"), when the children are older and the babies have grown to toddlerhood, another close-up of a calendar reveals the month to be October 1959. At the end of the final episode, Sidney is elected to the Rural District Council on 5 November 1959 (Guy Fawkes Night).\n\nCast\nMain cast members\nOf the four main cast members, Jason and Ferris appeared in all twenty episodes, while Zeta-Jones and Franks appeared in eighteen, their only absences being in the third series' double episode \"Cast Not Your Pearls Before Swine\" (3.3 & 3.4).\n\nDavid Jason, as Sidney Charles \"Pop\" Larkin, the father of the family\nPam Ferris, as Florence Daisy \"Ma\" (Parker) Larkin, the mother of the family\nCatherine Zeta-Jones, as Mariette Charlton, née Larkin, eldest Larkin daughter\nPhilip Franks, Cedric \"Charley\" Charlton, husband of Mariette\n\nRecurring cast – Larkin family\nThe actors playing the other Larkin children and grandchild were as below (listed in descending character age). All the children except those yet to be born appeared in the first episode. After appearing in the first six episodes, the actor playing Primrose was replaced, the second appearing from the seventh episode (the first Christmas special) onwards. The actors playing the roles of Oscar and John Blenheim first appear in episodes 1.5 and 2.1, respectively. Although a male character, John Blenheim was played by Daisy-May Bates, granddaughter of the author of the books.\n\nJulie Stichbury, as Primrose Larkin (1991) (6 episodes)\nAbigail Rokison, as Primrose Larkin (1991–1993) (12 episodes)\nIan Tucker, as Montgomery 'Monty' Larkin, their eldest son (13 episodes)\nChristina Giles, as Petunia Larkin, twin sister to Zinnia (18 episodes)\nKatherine Giles, as Zinnia Larkin, twin sister to Petunia (18 episodes)\nStephanie Ralph, as Victoria Larkin, the youngest Larkin daughter (19 episodes)\nRoss Marriott, as Oscar Larkin, their youngest child (16 episodes)\nDaisy-May Bates, as John Marlborough Churchill Blenheim Charlton, the only son of Charlie and Mariette (11 episodes)\n\nRecurring cast – others\nVarious other actors appeared in more than one storyline, i.e. in more than one double episode.\n\nRachel Bell as Edith Pilchester, a local spinster (16 episodes)\nMoray Watson as the Brigadier, a local retired army officer (11 episodes)\nKika Mirylees as Angela Snow, a local woman (7 episodes)\nMartyn Read as Sergeant Wilson, a local police officer (6 episodes)\nTyler Butterworth as Reverend John Candy, the local vicar (4 episodes)\nMichael Jayston as Ernest Bristow, the brewery owner (4 episodes)\nCarol MacReady as Mrs. Daws, a local shopkeeper (4 episodes)\nSheila Burrell as Mrs. Kinthley, owner of the hop-garden bought by Charlie (4 episodes)\nSteven Brand as Tom Sargent, love interest of Mariette (4 episodes)\nAnna Massey as Mademoiselle Antoinette Dupont, a French hotelier (3 episodes)\nMichael Culver as Sir George Bluff-Gore, a local landowner (3 episodes)\nRichenda Carey as Lady Bluff-Gore, wife of Sir George (3 episodes)\nJohn Carlin as Reverend Spink (3 episodes)\n\nEpisodes\nSeries 1\nSeries 2\nSeries 3\nProduction\nConception and development\nHaving been sold to MGM films in 1959, it was not until 1989 that Richard Bates, son of the author of the original books H. E. Bates, was able to purchase the rights to the novels. At the same time, Yorkshire Television were looking for a new project for David Jason, who had starred for them in A Bit of a Do. Richard Bates went on to executive produce the show, alongside Vernon Lawrence of Yorkshire Television.\n\nCasting\nBates had originally considered Bob Hoskins as ideal for the role of Pop, but Lawrence was of the view his increasing fame as a film actor would create problems. Jason was cast first, followed by Ferris and Franks. Finding an actor to fit with the novel's description of Mariette as a black-haired and olive-skinned beauty proved difficult, with over 300 hopefuls being rejected until Zeta-Jones was cast. With filming due to start, she had been spotted appearing in 42nd Street at the Drury Lane Theatre.\n\nFilming\nEach one-hour episode took two weeks to film, followed by two months in post production.\n\nFilming locations\nMuch of the series was filmed in and around the village of Pluckley in Kent; executive producer Richard Bates lived just a few miles away.The location for \"Home Farm\", the Larkin residence, was Buss Farm, a few miles south of Pluckley, owned by the Holmes family. All four main buildings of the Grade II listed farm were utilised: the farmhouse itself, a square oast house (depicted in the title sequence), a Tudor barn and cart lodge. After being put up for sale by the family in 2012, it was purchased in 2013 by a businessman. It was renamed \"Darling Buds Farm\", and several buildings were converted into guest accommodation themed around the show.\n\nOther locations in Pluckley village itself were used extensively; the Black Horse pub in The Street was renamed the Hare and Hounds and used as the Larkins' local. Church Gate Cottage and Fig Tree Cottage in The Street served as Edith Pilchester's and The Brigadier's homes, respectively. Pluckley primary school, also in The Street, served as the village hall. The butcher's shop also featured, and the Post Office (dressed as the grocer's). Church scenes were filmed at St Nicholas Church in the village.The cricket scenes were filmed at Little Chart Cricket Club, a village north east of Pluckley.\n\nFurther afield, in and around Tenterden, Kent, Halden Place in Halden Lane, Cranbrook, served as Mrs Kinthley's hop garden, Wentwood Cottage in Swain Road served as Charley and Mariette's cottage, and the Kent & East Sussex Railway was the location of Charley's arrival in Kent, and the station used by Ma, Charley and Mariette shopping for her wedding dress. Other scenes shot in Kent included the Shepherd Neame Brewery in Faversham, and scenes of the Larkins' beach holiday, filmed in Folkestone, including a backdrop of the Leas Lift. Mlle. Dupont is met by the Larkins at Folkestone Harbour after her channel crossing.Little filming was done inside the farmhouse, the interiors having been shot in a studio at Yorkshire Television. Scenes shot in the former Wennington School near Wetherby in Yorkshire, which stood in for Bluff Hall, were included. Other filming locations in Yorkshire include the Hotel Metropole in Leeds, which stood in for the 'Marble Arch Hotel'.\nTo mark the series' 20th anniversary, Kent County Council established a tourist trail featuring the various film locations, other local attractions, and Kent food.\n\nMusic\nThe series' music producer Pip Burley wrote the title theme, \"Perfick!\". He had submitted the piece anonymously, having deemed the submissions received from a shortlist of composers missed the point of the essential romanticism of the show. Although it also featured lyrics, drawn from the words used in the novels, the theme music for the series did not feature them. The song with lyrics was later sung by David Jason for the radio adaptation of the last book in the Larkin series, A Little of What You Fancy.\n\nFuture\nIn 2016, having filmed a cinema adaptation of another classic TV series, Dad's Army, Zeta-Jones responded positively to suggestions that The Darling Buds of May might also be similarly remade, stating \"I'd be playing Ma Larkin, but I'm up for it\". However, by 2020, any plans for a film were put on hold, with the Radio Times reporting that ITV was to remake the series, with Simon Nye writing the scripts and with Bradley Walsh and Joanna Scanlan in the cast. The series, with the title The Larkins, first aired in October 2021 starring Walsh and Scanlan, with Sabrina Bartlett and Peter Davison also amongst the cast.\n\nThemes\nLocally produced food and drink intentionally played a core role in the series. Due to not being ripe at the right time, the strawberries used in the series were imported from Holland. One of the most iconic scenes features Pop and Ma eating a meal together whilst having a bath. With several scenes featuring eating, the fact Ferris was a vegetarian had to be worked around by the production staff. Both Ferris and Jason gained weight due to the amount of food they had to consume, often doing multiple takes for several scenes at one time, to make the scenes look realistic.Another theme of the series was the Larkin family's habit of giving their children unusual or themed first and middle names. Mariette was created by combining 'Marie' and 'Antoinette'. Montgomery was named after wartime officer Field Marshall Montgomery. Victoria was named for being born during the plum season (Victoria plum). While Monty and Victoria have no middle names, the other children have several: Primrose Violet Anemone Iris Magnolia Narcissa, twins Petunia June Florence Nightingale and Zinnia June Florence Nightingale, and Oscar Columbus Septimus Dupont, the last one being in tribute to the French hotelier Madamoiselle Dupont, who features in the series. Mariette and Charlie continue the family penchant for elaborate naming by christening their son John Marlborough Churchill Blenheim.\n\nRelease\nBroadcast\nThe first episode was transmitted on the ITV channel at 8pm on a Sunday night.\n\nHome media\nWhen the series was first released on video, it sold £1m worth of copies in the first four days.DVD releases:\n\nNote: The 2008 and 2011 DVD sets from ITV Studios list that there are 11 episodes; this is due to the fact that all episodes in series 1–3 (not including the specials) contain two parts, making them count as a whole.\n\nSoundtrack\nA 16-track soundtrack of the series was released by EMI on CD in 1991.\n\nReception\nThe series was a ratings success, its \"feel-good\" factor during economic recession often noted as the reason. Whilst Yorkshire TV classified it as a drama, audiences and critics have generally considered it to be a comedy/drama.\nThe first episode broke a British broadcasting record, becoming the first instance of a new series topping the national ratings, beating the soap opera Coronation Street (also an ITV production) on the night. This came as a shock to producers, although they had been hopeful of good ratings due to dull weather and the belief that people would be looking for something to lift their spirits following the end of the Gulf War.Jason attributed the series' popularity to the public wanting a more wholesome, inclusive and inoffensive viewing option at a time when violence on television was increasing. This was one of the main reasons he decided to take the role.The series generated an upsurge in sales of H. E. Bates's novels.\n\nAwards\n1992 Ivor Novello Award – Best Theme from a TV/Radio Production\n\nSource novels and other adaptations\nThe series is based on the works of H. E. Bates, who died in 1974. Having moved from the industrialised English Midlands to a granary in Little Chart in Kent in 1930 in search of new inspirations for his work, he was initially frustrated in his efforts to create a novel based on the Kent way of life. His inspiration for the Larkin stories eventually came in 1955 while on a trip to Sittingbourne. Pausing at Faversham, he observed the joyful camaraderie of a large boisterous family as they emerged from a shop and departed in a large blue truck. Combining this with observations of another family on a nearby small-holding, he set about writing about how these families might live. Originally a short story, he expanded it into a novel, followed by a further four books, the titles of the first four of which were used as episode titles for the TV series:\nThe Darling Buds of May (1958)\nA Breath of French Air (1959)\nWhen the Green Woods Laugh (1960)\nOh! To be in England! (1963)\nA Little of What You Fancy? (1970)The first novel in the series was originally adapted to the screen in 1959 as The Mating Game, starring Debbie Reynolds and Tony Randall as Mariette and Charley.\nThe fifth novel, A Little of What You Fancy?, was never adapted for television, but it was adapted into a six-part series by Eric Pringle for BBC Radio, with Jason and Ferris reprising their roles, first airing in February 1996.In May 2011 a stage production of the series was put on at Buss Farm.The most recent version is The Larkins, adapted for television in 2021.\nPassage 3:\nSant Martí d'Empúries\nSant Martí d'Empúries is an entity of the town of L'Escala. It is located next to the ruins of Empúries or Empòrion. Ancient Greeks established the settlement in the 6th century BC. It was the county seat until 1079 Empúries moved to Castelló d'Empúries place less exposed to attack.\nSant Martí d'Empúries is a staging point on the GR 92 long distance footpath, which roughly follows the length of the Mediterranean coast of Spain. Stage 5, to the north, takes a route behind the coast to the El Cortalet pond in the Parc Natural dels Aiguamolls de l'Empordà, a distance of 20.2 kilometres (12.6 mi). Stage 6, to the south, follows the coast to l'Escala and then takes an inland route across the Montgri Massif to reach the next staging point of Torroella de Montgrí, a distance of 20.0 kilometres (12.4 mi).\n\nHistory\nIt was an inhabited place since the arrival of Greeks from Massalia, actual Marseille (France) in the 6th century BC. Greeks established a settlement there called it, Kypsela (Greek: Κύψελα). At the ancient times there is a possibility that there was a temple of Artemis on the island.It was Christianized by Saint Feliu, an African martyr who died in 304 in Girona. He was bishop between 516 and 693. Charlemagne mentions Ermenguer as first Count of Empúries in 812.\nPassage 4:\nSmith Island, Maryland\nSmith Island is a collection of three distinct island communities, Tylerton, Rhodes Point, and Ewell, Maryland on the Chesapeake Bay, on the border of Maryland and Virginia territorial waters in the United States. The island is the last inhabited island in Maryland that is not accessible by vehicle, where most of the islands are eroding due to tidal currents and sea level rise. A study conducted in 2008 by the DNR reported that Smith Island is expected to completely erode by 2100 if no action was taken.The island's population is approximately 220, down from a peak of about 800.  On its Maryland side, Smith Island is a census-designated place (CDP) in Somerset County. It is included in the Salisbury, Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\nGeography\nSmith Island lies approximately 10 miles (16 km) west of Crisfield, Maryland, across the Tangier Sound portion of the Chesapeake Bay. The island consists of three communities, namely Ewell, Tylerton and Rhodes Point, which all sit on the Maryland portion of the island. The Virginia portion is uninhabited, although it once contained many homes of early settlers.Although a portion of this island lies within Virginia, \"Smith Island, Virginia\" refers to a separate but identically named barrier island off Cape Charles.\n\nClimate change and sea level rise\nBy the 2010s, the island had shrunk mainly due to erosion and rising sea levels. In the last 150 years, Smith Island has lost over 3,300 acres (13 km2) of wetlands. The island is projected to be completely eroded by 2100 should the sea level rise by another foot. Preventative measures including a jetty-building project completed in 2018, and the realignment of waterways through dredging, were implemented in the hope to stop this. These restoration efforts will be ongoing for the next 50 years to restore 1,900 acres (8 km2) of submerged aquatic vegetation and 240 acres (1 km2) of wetlands. Moreover, the island is building additional coastal defenses.\n\nDemographics\nThe community is located in a small town-area in the central part of the island, spread across the three inhabited locations of Ewell, Rhodes Point and Tylerton, all located in the state of Maryland. The northern part of Smith Island also includes the Martin National Wildlife Refuge. The southernmost portion of the island consisting of marsh lies in Accomack County, Virginia.As of the 2010 Census, there were 276 people residing in the CDP. The population density was 81.7 inhabitants per square mile (31.5/km2). There were 218 housing units at an average density of 57.5 per square mile (22.2/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 99.6% White, 0.82% African American, 0.27% Native American, and 0.82% from two or more races. 51% of Smith Island's residents were English, 4% Greek, 3% Irish, 3% Scottish, and 3% French.There were 167 households, out of which 19.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 60.5% were married couples living together, 4.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 32.9% were non-families. 29.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 16.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.18 and the average family size was 2.69.In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 14.6% under the age of 18, 5.5% from 18 to 24, 22.3% from 25 to 44, 34.6% from 45 to 64, and 23.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 50 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.8 males.The median income for a household in the CDP was $26,324, and the median income for a family was $29,375. Males had a median income of $26,250 versus $28,750 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $25,469. About 14.4% of families and 37.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 26.9% of those under age 18 and 67.9% of those age 65 or over.\n\nTransportation\nSmith Island has no airport and no bridges to the mainland; it can be accessed only by boat. Passenger-only ferries connect Smith Island at Ewell to Point Lookout, Maryland, and Reedville, Virginia, on the Western shore of the Chesapeake Bay (seasonal) and from Crisfield, Maryland, on its Eastern Shore (year-round).  A daily passenger ferry also runs between Crisfield, Maryland, and the smaller island of Tylerton, Maryland.Few motor vehicles exist on the islands, those of which are all on the northern community of Ewell and the connected Rhodes Point.  Main modes of transportation for all three communities include golf carts as well as non-motorized transportation.\n\nHistory and language\nThe island was charted by John Smith. British settlers arrived on the island in the 17th century, arriving from Cornwall, Wales, and Dorset, England, via Virginia. The island's population peaked at 800 in the 1900s.Smith Island is inhabited by one of the region's oldest English-speaking communities, which is known for its relic accent, preserving speech patterns from the original English colonial settlers. The local dialect is like the dialects of the West Country of England, including Cornwall. The dialect contains some relict features indicative of its origins. The dialect is like the Ocracoke Brogue, sometimes referred to as the Outer Banks Brogue.\nThe 1940 Maryland guide described a series of economic conflicts that characterized relationships between the inhabitants of Smith Island, the inhabitants of nearby Tangier Island, and agencies of the Federal government in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For example, although 23,000 acres of rich oyster beds had been ceded from Maryland to Virginia in 1877,the Smith Island men kept on dredging there for 50 years despite repeated attacks by Virginia patrol boats and inter-island battles in which oystermen on both sides were killed and wounded. The warfare ended only when the oysters in the area died ... Although killing wild ducks for market has been outlawed by Federal enactment since 1918, Smith Island remains a source of anxiety to the United States Biological Survey. Wardens risk their lives when drawn to the lonely island marshes by the deep booming of swivel guns mounted in sneak-boats—artillery that throws a pound of shot at a blast to kill and cripple ducks by the hundreds. To spot wire-enclosed duck traps, wardens in airplanes drop streamers of paper for the guidance of wardens in boats who attempt to make arrests, sometimes successfully, sometimes not. The islanders are sure that God has given them the ducks, oysters, fish, and crabs to take as they wish and they bitterly resent man-made game laws.\nThe Island Belle, a former passenger ferry to the islands, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.After the 2012 Hurricane Sandy, the Department of Housing and Community Development for the state of Maryland offered buyouts to landowners, most of whom refused the offer.\n\nSmith Island cake\nSmith Island traditions include a region-specific cuisine, its most famous dish being the Smith Island cake, somewhat resembling the Prinzregententorte, with 8 to 15 thin layers alternating with cooked chocolate frosting.Beginning in the 1800s, Smith Islanders would send these cakes with the watermen on the autumn oyster harvest. The bakers began using fudge instead of buttercream frostings, as cakes frosted with fudge lasted much longer than cakes with other types of frosting.Scratch recipes typically involve evaporated milk, while recipes based on commercial cake mixes add condensed milk.The most common recipes yield yellow cake with chocolate frosting, but other flavors variation include coconut, fig, strawberry, lemon, and orange.  Smith Island cake is baked for any occasion, a dessert that needs no holiday.Smith Island cake is also baked as the feature prize for a local fundraising tradition called a cake walk, which is a game played like musical chairs where donated cakes serve as the prize.  Great attention is paid to the perfection of the pencil-thin layers that form the distinctive cake.  Before each round, the prize Smith Island cake at stake is cut in half and shown to the players who pay to participate in the game.  A poorly stacked Smith Island cake may not attract many players and as a result, not raise as much money as a more perfectly executed cake.Smith Island cake became the officially designated state dessert of Maryland on April 24, 2008.\n\nSee also\nIsland Belle (vessel)\nFog Point Light\nSolomons Lump Light\nTangier Island\nPassage 5:\nBritish nationality law\nThe primary law governing nationality in the United Kingdom is the British Nationality Act 1981, which came into force on 1 January 1983. Regulations apply to the British Islands, which include the UK itself and the Crown dependencies, and the 14 British Overseas Territories.\nThe six classes of British nationality each have varying degrees of civil and political rights, due to the UK's historical status as a colonial empire. The principal class of British nationality is British citizenship, which is associated with the British Islands. British nationals associated with an overseas territory are British Overseas Territories citizens (BOTCs). Almost all BOTCs (except for those from Akrotiri and Dhekelia) have also been British citizens since 2002. Individuals connected with former British colonies may hold residual forms of British nationality, which do not confer an automatic right of abode in the United Kingdom and generally may no longer be acquired. These residual nationalities are the statuses of British Overseas citizen, British subject, British National (Overseas), and British protected person.\nAll persons born in the British Islands before 1 January 1983 were automatically granted citizenship by birth regardless of the nationalities of their parents. Individuals born in those territories since that date only receive citizenship at birth if at least the mother is a British citizen or holds settled status. Foreign nationals may naturalise as British citizens after meeting a minimum residence requirement (usually five years) and acquiring settled status.\nThe United Kingdom was previously a member state of the European Union (EU) and British citizens held full EU citizenship. They had held automatic and permanent permission to live and work in any EU or European Free Trade Association (EFTA) country and were able to vote in elections to the European Parliament. Despite the UK's withdrawal from the union in 2020, British citizens continue to hold permanent permission to work and reside in the Republic of Ireland as part of the Common Travel Area.\n\nTerminology\nThe distinction between the meaning of the terms citizenship and nationality is not always clear in the English language and differs by country. Generally, nationality refers to a person's legal belonging to a sovereign state and is the common term used in international treaties when addressing members of a country, while citizenship usually means the set of rights and duties a person has in that nation. This distinction is clearly defined in many non-English speaking countries but not in the Anglosphere. Historically, an individual associated with Britain was neither a national nor a citizen, but a British subject. British citizenship was not created until passage of the British Nationality Act 1981. This Act defined six types of nationality with varying degrees of civil and political rights, dependent on a person's connections with the United Kingdom, overseas territories, or former colonies. British citizens hold their status because of a close connection with the British Islands, usually through their own (or parents' or grandparents') birth, adoption, naturalisation, or registration as citizens of the UK.\n\nTypes of British nationality\nThere are six types of British nationality: any person who is a British citizen, British Overseas Territories citizen (BOTC), British Overseas citizen (BOC), British National (Overseas) (BN(O)), British subject, or British protected person is a British national. Of these statuses, only British citizenship grants automatic right of abode in the United Kingdom. British Overseas Territories are areas outside of the British Islands where the UK holds sovereignty. Since 2002, nearly all BOTCs also hold British citizenship, except for those associated with Akrotiri and Dhekelia.The other four categories are residual nationality classes that generally cannot be acquired. BOCs are people connected with former British colonies who have no close ties to the UK or overseas territories. BN(O)s are Hong Kong residents who voluntarily registered for this status before the territory's transfer to China in 1997. British subjects hold their status through a connection either to former  British India or to what is now the Republic of Ireland as they existed before 1949. British protected persons come from areas controlled by the British Empire but were never formally incorporated as Crown territory; this includes protectorates, protected states, mandated territories, and Indian princely states.\n\nHistory\nDevelopment from feudal allegiance\nBefore the concept of nationality was codified in legislation, inhabitants of English communities owed allegiance to their feudal lords, who were themselves vassals of the monarch. This system of loyalty, indirectly owed to the monarch personally, developed into a general establishment of subjecthood to the Crown. Calvin's Case in 1608 established the principle of jus soli, that all those who were born within Crown dominions were natural-born subjects. After passage of the Acts of Union 1707, English and Scottish subjects became British subjects. Similarly, the Kingdom of Ireland was merged with the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801. Natural-born subjects were considered to owe perpetual allegiance to the Crown and could not voluntarily renounce British subject status until this was first permitted in 1870.Prior to 1708, foreigners could only be naturalised through Acts of Parliament. Protestants fleeing religious persecution in mainland Europe were allowed to naturalise as subjects in 1708, but this was quickly repealed in 1711 in response to the number of migrants exercising that ability. A standard administrative process was not introduced until 1844, when applicants were first able to acquire naturalisation grants from the Home Office. Despite the creation of this pathway, personalised naturalising legislation continued to be enacted until 1975.The monarch could personally make any individual a subject by royal prerogative. By this method, a foreigner became a denizen – although they were no longer considered an alien, they could not pass subject status to their children by descent and were barred from Crown service and public office. This mechanism was no longer used after 1873.Until the mid-19th century, it was unclear whether nationality regulations in the United Kingdom were applicable elsewhere in the British Empire. Individual colonies had each developed their own procedures and requirements for naturalisation, granting subject status at the discretion of the local governments. In 1847, Parliament formalised a clear distinction between subjects who were naturalised in the UK and those who became British subjects in other territories. Individuals who naturalised in the UK were deemed to have received the status by imperial naturalisation, which was valid throughout the Empire. Those naturalising in colonies were said to have gone through local naturalisation and were given subject status valid only within the relevant territory; a subject who locally naturalised in Canada was a British subject there, but not in England or New Zealand. When travelling outside of the Empire, British subjects who were locally naturalised in a colony were still entitled to imperial protection.Certain territories that came under British jurisdiction were not formally incorporated as Crown territory proper. These included protectorates, protected states, mandated territories, and Indian princely states. Because domestic law treated these areas as foreign territory, birth in one of these areas did not automatically confer British subject status. Instead, most people associated with these territories were designated as British protected persons. British protected persons were treated as aliens in the United Kingdom, but both British subjects and protected persons could be issued British passports. Protected persons could not travel to the UK without first requesting permission, but were afforded the same consular protection as British subjects when travelling outside of the Empire.\n\nImperial common code\nParliament brought regulations for British subject status into codified statute law for the first time with passage of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914. British subject status was standardised as a common nationality across the Empire. Dominions that adopted Part II of this Act as part of local legislation were authorised to grant subject status to aliens by imperial naturalisation.The 1914 regulations codified the doctrine of coverture into imperial nationality law, where a woman's consent to marry a foreigner was also assumed to be intent to denaturalise; British women who married foreign men automatically lost their British nationality. There were two exceptions to this: a wife married to a husband who lost his British subject status was able to retain British nationality by declaration, and a British-born widow or divorcée who had lost her British nationality through marriage could reacquire that status without meeting residence requirements after the dissolution or termination of her marriage.By the end of the First World War, the Dominions had exercised increasing levels of autonomy in managing their own affairs and each by then had developed a distinct national identity. Britain formally recognised this at the 1926 Imperial Conference, jointly issuing the Balfour Declaration with all the Dominion heads of government, which stated that the United Kingdom and Dominions were autonomous and equal to each other within the British Commonwealth of Nations. Full legislative independence was granted to the Dominions with passage of the Statute of Westminster 1931.Women's rights groups throughout the Empire pressured the imperial government during this time to amend nationality regulations that tied a married woman's status to that of her husband. Because the government could no longer enforce legislative supremacy over the Dominions after 1931 and wanted to maintain a strong constitutional link to them through the common nationality code, it was unwilling to make major changes without unanimous agreement among the Dominions on this issue, which it did not have. Imperial legal uniformity was nevertheless eroded during the 1930s; New Zealand and Australia amended their laws in 1935 and 1936 to allow women denaturalised by marriage to retain their rights as British subjects, and Ireland changed its regulations in 1935 to cause no change to a woman's nationality after her marriage.\n\nIrish independence\nIrish resistance to the Union and desire for local self-governance led to the Irish War of Independence. Following the war, the island of Ireland was partitioned into two parts. Southern Ireland became the Irish Free State in 1922, while Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom. Under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Northern Ireland was included in the Irish Free State on independence, but had the right to opt out of the new state within one month of its establishment. This option was exercised on 7 December 1922. The 24-hour period in which Northern Ireland was officially part of the Irish Free State meant that every person ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland on 6 December who fulfilled the citizenship provisions in the Constitution of the Irish Free State had automatically become an Irish citizen on that date.At its inception, the Irish Free State gained independence as a Dominion within the British Empire. Imperial legislation at the time dictated that although individual Dominions could define a citizenship for their own citizens, that citizenship would only be effective within the local Dominion's borders. A Canadian, New Zealand, or Irish citizen who traveled outside of their own country would have been regarded as a British subject. This was reinforced by Article 3 of the 1922 Free State Constitution, which stated that Irish citizenship could be exercised \"within the limits of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State\".When Free State authorities were first preparing to issue Irish passports in 1923, the British government insisted on the inclusion of some type of wording that described the holders of these passports as \"British subjects\". The two sides could not reach agreement on this issue and when the Irish government began issuing passports in 1924, British authorities refused to accept these documents. British consular staff were instructed to confiscate any Irish passports that did not include the term \"British subject\" and replace them with British passports. This situation continued until 1930, when Irish passports were amended to describe its holders as \"one of His Majesty's subjects of the Irish Free State\". Despite these disagreements, the two governments agreed not to establish border controls between their jurisdictions and all Irish citizens and British subjects continued to have the ability to move freely within the Common Travel Area. Although Irish citizens have not been considered British subjects under Irish law since 1935, the British government continued to treat virtually all Irish citizens as British subjects, except for those who had acquired Irish citizenship by naturalisation since the Free State had not incorporated Part II of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914 into its legislation.\n\nChanging relationship with the Empire and Commonwealth\nDiverging developments in Dominion legislation, as well as growing assertions of local national identity separate from that of Britain and the Empire, culminated with the creation of a substantive Canadian citizenship in 1946, breaking the system of a common imperial nationality. Combined with the approaching independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, comprehensive reform to nationality law was necessary at this point to address ideas that were incompatible with the previous system.The British Nationality Act 1948 redefined British subject as any citizen of the United Kingdom, its colonies, or other Commonwealth countries. Commonwealth citizen was first defined in this Act to have the same meaning. This alternative term was necessary to retain a number of newly independent countries in the Commonwealth that wished to become republics rather than preserve the monarch as head of state. The change in naming also indicated a shift in the base theory to this aspect of British nationality; allegiance to the Crown was no longer a requirement to possess British subject status and the common status would be maintained by voluntary agreement among the various members of the Commonwealth.British subject/Commonwealth citizen status co-existed with the citizenships of each Commonwealth country. A person born in Australia would be both an Australian citizen and a British subject. British subjects under the previous meaning who held that status on 1 January 1949 because of a connection with the United Kingdom or a remaining colony became Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC). CUKC status was the principal form of British nationality during this period of time.There was also a category of people called British subjects without citizenship. Irish citizens who fulfilled certain requirements could file formal claims with the Home Secretary to remain British subjects under this definition. Additionally, those who did not qualify for CUKC status or citizenship in other Commonwealth countries, or were connected with a country that had not yet defined citizenship laws, would transitionally remain British subjects in this group.\n\nIrish departure from the Commonwealth\nDespite the accommodations for republics, Ireland ended its Commonwealth membership in 1948 when it formally declared itself a republic and removed the British monarch's remaining official functions in the Irish state. This was recognised by Britain after passage of the Ireland Act 1949. Although Irish citizens have no longer been defined as British subjects in British law since 1949, they continue to be treated as non-foreign in the United Kingdom and retain the same rights and privileges exercised by Commonwealth citizens; Irish citizens remain eligible to vote and stand for parliament in the UK.The British Nationality Act 1948 unintentionally excluded certain British subjects associated with Ireland from acquiring CUKC status. The wording of that law did not take into account the 24-hour period during which Northern Ireland was part of the Irish Free State in 1922. Individuals born before 1922 in the area that became the Republic of Ireland to fathers also born in that area but were domiciled in Northern Ireland on Irish independence had nevertheless automatically acquired Irish citizenship. The Ireland Act 1949 specifically addresses this by deeming any person in such circumstances who had never registered for Irish citizenship and had not permanently resided in the Republic between 10 April 1935 and 1 January 1949 as a CUKC and having never ceased to be a British subject.\n\nRestricting Commonwealth free movement\nAll British subjects under the reformed system initially continued to hold free movement rights in both the UK and Ireland. Non-white immigration into the UK was systemically discouraged, but strong economic conditions in Britain following the Second World War attracted an unprecedented wave of colonial migration. This entitlement was part of a wider initiative to preserve close relationships with certain Dominions and colonies (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and Southern Rhodesia) and to moderate nationalist attitudes within the Commonwealth. In response, Parliament imposed immigration controls on any subjects originating from outside the British Islands with the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962. This restriction was somewhat relaxed by the Immigration Act 1971 for patrials, subjects whose parents or grandparents were born in the United Kingdom, which gave effective preferential treatment to white Commonwealth citizens. Ireland mirrored this restriction and limited free movement only to people born on the islands of Great Britain or Ireland. However, individuals born in the UK since 1983 are only British citizens if at least one parent is already a British citizen. The Irish regulation created a legal anomaly where persons born in Britain without British citizenship nevertheless held an unrestricted right to settle in Ireland; this inconsistency was removed in 1999.In other parts of the Commonwealth, British subjects already did not have an automatic right to settle. Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa had immigration restrictions in place for British subjects from outside their jurisdictions targeted at non-white migrants since the late 19th century. After 1949, non-local British subjects under the new definition who were resident in these independent Commonwealth countries continued to retain certain privileges. This included eligibility to vote in elections, for preferred paths to citizenship, and for welfare benefits. British subjects were eligible to vote in New Zealand until 1975 and Australia until 1984 (though subjects on the electoral roll in that year are still eligible). In Canada, voting eligibility was revoked at the federal level in 1975, but not fully phased out in provinces until 2006. All Commonwealth citizens remain eligible to vote and stand for public office in the UK.\n\nPost-imperial redefinition of nationality classes\nBy the 1970s and 1980s, most colonies of the British Empire had become independent and remaining ties to the United Kingdom had been significantly weakened. The UK updated its nationality law to reflect the more modest boundaries of its remaining territory and possessions with the British Nationality Act 1981. CUKCs were reclassified in 1983 into different nationality groups based on their ancestry, birthplace, and immigration status: CUKCs who had right of abode in the United Kingdom became British citizens while those connected with a remaining colony became British Dependent Territories citizens (BDTCs). Remaining CUKCs who were no longer associated with a British territory became British Overseas citizens. The definition of \"British subject\" became limited to include only the category of people previously called British subjects without citizenship who held that status through a connection with former British India or Ireland before 1949.\n\nFormer membership in the European Union\nIn 1973, the United Kingdom joined the European Communities (EC), a set of organisations that later developed into the European Union (EU). British citizens were able to work in other EC/EU countries under the freedom of movement for workers established by the 1957 Treaty of Rome and participated in their first European Parliament elections in 1979. With the creation of European Union citizenship by the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, free movement rights were extended to all nationals of EU member states regardless of their employment status. The scope of these rights was further expanded with the establishment of the European Economic Area in 1994 to include any national of an EFTA member state except for Switzerland, which concluded a separate free movement agreement with the EU that came into force in 2002.Not all British nationals were EU citizens. Only British citizens, British Overseas Territories citizens connected with Gibraltar, and British subjects under the 1981 Act who held UK right of abode were defined as UK nationals for the purposes of EU law. Although the Crown dependencies were part of the European Union Customs Union, free movement of persons was never implemented in those territories. Following the UK's withdrawal from the EU on 31 January 2020, British nationals have no longer been EU citizens. Despite this, British citizens continue to have free movement in Ireland as part of the preexisting arrangement for the Common Travel Area.While the UK was a member state of the EU, Cypriot and Maltese citizens held a particularly favoured status there. While non-EU Commonwealth citizens continued to need a residence visa to live in the UK, Cypriot and Maltese citizens were able to settle there and immediately hold full rights to political participation due to their status as both Commonwealth and EU citizens. This group of EU citizens (along with Irish citizens) domiciled in the UK were able to vote in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum while all other non-British EU citizens could not.\n\nAcquisition and loss of nationality\nBritish citizenship\nPrior to 1983, all Individuals born within the British Islands (the United Kingdom and Crown Dependencies) received British citizenship at birth regardless of the nationalities of their parents. Individuals born afterwards only receive citizenship at birth if at least one parent is a British citizen or considered to have settled status in the UK. Children born overseas are British citizens by descent if either parent is a citizen otherwise than by descent, subject to regulations. Adopted children are treated as if they were naturally born to the adopting parents at the time of adoption. Children born abroad to members of the British Armed Forces or British citizens on Crown service are treated as if they were born in the UK.Children born in the UK to a resident Irish citizen at any time are always British citizens at birth. Since 1983, the status of a child born in the UK is dependent on whether their parents held British citizenship or settled status at the time of their birth. Irish citizens residing in the UK are deemed to hold settled status upon arrival .Regulations concerning settled status for other European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Swiss citizens have changed greatly over time, affecting the status of their children born during the different regulatory periods. EU/EEA citizens living in the UK before 2 October 2000 were automatically considered to be settled. Between that date and 29 April 2006, EU/EEA citizens were required to apply for permanent residency. Swiss citizens became subject to the same regulations on 1 June 2002. From 30 April 2006 until 30 June 2021, EU/EEA and Swiss citizens living in the UK for at least five years automatically received permanent resident status. Permanent resident status for these citizens expired on 1 July 2021, after which they have been required to hold settled status through the European Union Settlement Scheme or another path.Foreign nationals may naturalise as British citizens after residing in the UK for more than five years and possessing indefinite leave to remain (ILR) for at least one year. The residency requirement is reduced to three years if an applicant is married to a British citizen and they immediately become eligible for naturalisation after receiving ILR or equivalent. Applicants must demonstrate proficiency in the English, Welsh, or Scottish Gaelic languages and pass the Life in the United Kingdom test.\n\nBritish Overseas Territories citizenship\nIndividuals born in a territory automatically receive BOTC status if at least one parent is a BOTC or has belonger status. Children born in an overseas territory to British citizen parents who are not settled in a territory are British citizens at birth, but not BOTCs. Parents do not necessarily need to be connected with the same overseas territory to pass on BOTC status. Alternatively, a child born in an overseas territory may be registered as a BOTC if either parent becomes a BOTC or settles in any overseas territory subsequent to birth. A child who lives in the same territory until age 10 and is not absent for more than 90 days in each year is also entitled to registration as a BOTC. Furthermore, an adopted child automatically become a BOTC on the effective day of adoption if either parent is a BOTC or has belonger status. In all cases that an individual is a British Overseas Territories citizen at birth or adoption within the territories, that person is a BOTC otherwise than by descent.Individuals born outside of the territories are BOTCs by descent if either parent is a BOTC otherwise than by descent. Unmarried fathers cannot automatically pass on BOTC status, and it would be necessary for them to register children as BOTCs. If a parent is a BOTC by descent, additional requirements apply to register children as BOTCs. Parents in Crown service who have children abroad are exempted from these circumstances, and their children would be BOTCs otherwise than by descent, as if they had been born on their home territory.Foreigners and non-BOTC British nationals may naturalise as British Overseas Territories citizens after residing in a territory for more than five years and possessing belonger status or permanent residency for more than one year. The residency requirement is reduced to three years if an applicant is married to a BOTC. All applicants for naturalisation and registration are normally considered by the governor of the relevant territory, but the Home Secretary retains discretionary authority to grant BOTC status. Since 2004, BOTC applicants aged 18 or older are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Sovereign and loyalty pledge to the relevant territory during their citizenship ceremonies.All British Overseas Territories citizens other than those solely connected with Akrotiri and Dhekelia became British citizens on 21 May 2002, and children born on qualified overseas territories to dual BOTC-British citizens since that date are both BOTCs and British citizens otherwise than by descent. Prior to 2002, only BOTCs from Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands were given unrestricted access to citizenship. BOTCs naturalised after that date may also become British citizens by registration at the discretion of the Home Secretary. Becoming a British citizen has no effect on BOTC status; BOTCs may also simultaneously be British citizens.\n\nOther nationality classes\nIt is generally not possible to acquire other forms of British nationality. British Overseas citizenship, British subjecthood, and British protected person status are only transferred by descent if an individual born to a parent holding one of these statuses would otherwise be stateless. British Overseas citizens retain their status by association with most former British colonies, British subjects are connected specifically with Ireland or British India before 1949, and British protected persons are associated with territories that were under British control but not formally incorporated as part of the British Empire. British National (Overseas) status was exclusively granted by voluntary registration to Hong Kong residents who had been British Dependent Territories citizens prior to the transfer of sovereignty to China in 1997 and cannot be newly acquired in any case. Noncitizen British nationals may become British citizens by registration, rather than naturalisation, after residing in the United Kingdom for more than five years and possessing ILR for more than one year.\n\nRenunciation and restoration\nAny type of British nationality can be renounced by making a declaration to the Home Secretary, provided that the declarant possesses or intends to acquire another nationality. Former British citizens or BOTCs may subsequently apply for nationality restoration. Applicants who had originally renounced their British nationality in order to retain or acquire another nationality are entitled to register as British citizens or BOTCs once. Any subsequent renunciation and application for restoration, or someone applying for restoration who originally renounced their British nationality for a reason unrelated to acquiring or retaining an alternate nationality, would be subject to the discretionary approval of the Home Secretary.\n\nAutomatic loss of British nationality\nBritish subjects (other than British subjects by virtue of a connection with the Republic of Ireland) and British protected persons lose British nationality upon acquiring any other form of nationality.\n\nThese provisions do not apply to British citizens.\nBritish Overseas Territories citizens (BOTCs) who acquire another nationality do not lose their BOTC status but they may be liable to lose belonger status in their home territory under its immigration laws. Such persons are advised to contact the governor of that territory for information.\nBritish Overseas citizens (BOCs) do not lose their BOC status upon acquisition of another citizenship, but any entitlement to registration as a British citizen on the grounds of having no other nationality no longer applies after acquiring another citizenship.\n\nDeprivation of British nationality\nThe British government does not publish the number of people it strips of citizenship, but independent research by a lawyer-run website, in 2022, found at least 464 people's citizenship was revoked in the last 15 years. After the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 came into force British nationals could be deprived of their citizenship if and only if the Secretary of State was satisfied they were responsible for acts seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the United Kingdom or an Overseas Territory.This was extended under the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006: people with dual nationality who are British nationals can be deprived of their British citizenship if the Secretary of State is satisfied that \"deprivation is conducive to the public good\", or if nationality was obtained by means of fraud, false representation or concealment of a material fact. Between 2006 and the end of 2021 at least 464 people have had their citizenship removed by the government since the law was introduced. There is a right of appeal. This provision has been in force since 16 June 2006 when the Immigration, Nationality and Asylum Act 2006 (Commencement No 1) Order 2006 brought it into force. Loss of British nationality in this way applies also to dual nationals who are British by birth. The Secretary of State may not deprive a person of British nationality, unless obtained by means of fraud, false representation or concealment of a material fact, if they are satisfied that the order would make a person stateless.This provision was again modified by the Immigration Act 2014 so as not to require that a third country would actually grant nationality to a person; British nationality can be revoked if \"the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds for believing that the person is able, under the law of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom, to become a national of such a country or territory.\"The powers to strip citizenship were initially very rarely used. Between 2010 and 2015, 33 dual nationals had been deprived of their British citizenship. In the two years to 2013 six people were deprived of citizenship; then in 2013, 18 people were deprived, increasing to 23 in 2014. In 2017, over 40 people had been deprived as of July (at this time increased numbers of British citizens went to join \"Islamic State\" and then tried to return).The Home Office does not issue information on these cases and is resistant to answering questions, for example under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. It appears that the government usually waits until the person has left Britain, then sends a warning notice to their British home and signs a deprivation order a day or two later. Appeals are heard at the highly secretive Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC), where the government can submit evidence that cannot be seen or challenged by the appellant.Home Secretary Sajid Javid said in 2018 that until then deprivation of nationality had been restricted to \"terrorists who are a threat to the country\", but that he intended to extend it to \"those who are convicted of the most grave criminal offences\". The acting director of Liberty responded \"The home secretary is taking us down a very dangerous road. ... making our criminals someone else’s problem is ... the government washing its hands of its responsibilities ... Banishment belongs in the dark ages.\"A Nationality and Borders Bill was introduced to the British House of Commons in July 2021, sponsored by the Home Office under Home Secretary Priti Patel. In November 2021, an amendment to the Bill was introduced which, if passed, would allow people to be deprived of British citizenship without being given notice. At the time the Home Office reiterated its position on citizenship: \"British citizenship is a privilege, not a right\".\n\nBritish citizenship ceremonies\nFrom 1 January 2004, all new applicants for British citizenship by naturalisation or registration aged 18 or over if their application is successful must attend a citizenship ceremony and either make an affirmation or take an oath of allegiance to the monarch, and make a pledge to the UK.\nCitizenship ceremonies are normally organised by:\n\nlocal councils in England, Scotland, and Wales\nthe Northern Ireland Office\nthe governments of the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey\nthe Governors of British Overseas Territories\nBritish consular offices outside the United Kingdom and territories.Persons from what is now the Republic of Ireland born before 1949 reclaiming British subject status under section 31 of the 1981 Act do not need to attend a citizenship ceremony. If such a person subsequently applies for British citizenship by registration or naturalisation, attendance at a ceremony is required.\nFor those who applied for British citizenship before 2004:\n\nthe oath of allegiance was administered privately through signing a witnessed form in front of a solicitor or other accredited person\nthose who already held British nationality (other than British protected persons) were exempt, as were those citizens of countries with the King as Head of State (such as Australia and Canada).\n\nSee also\nVisa policy of the United Kingdom\nVisa requirements for British citizens\nVisa requirements for British Nationals (Overseas)\nVisa requirements for British Overseas citizens\nVisa requirements for British Overseas Territories citizens\n\nNotes\nPassage 6:\nMinsk Region\nMinsk Region, also known as Minsk Oblast or Minsk Voblasts (Belarusian: Мі́нская во́бласць, romanized: Minskaja voblasć, IPA: [ˈmʲinskaja ˈvobɫasʲtsʲ]; Russian: Минская о́бласть, romanized: Minskaya oblast), is one of the regions of Belarus. Its administrative center is Minsk, although it is a separate administrative territorial entity of Belarus. As of 2011, the region's population is 1,411,500.\n\nGeography\nMinsk Region covers a total of 39,900 km2, about 19.44% of the national total area. Lake Narach, the largest lake in the country, is located in the northern part of the region. There are four other large lakes in this region: Svir (8th largest), Myadel (11th largest), Syalyava (14th largest) and Myastro (15th largest). It is the only region of Belarus whose border is not part of the international border of Belarus.\n\nHistory\nBeginning the 10th century, the territory of the current Minsk Region was part of Kievan Rus', the Principality of Polotsk, and later it was included in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. With the unification of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland, the territory became part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nIn 1793, as a result of the second partition of Polish territory, the area was annexed by Russia as the Minsk Region. During the collapse of the Russian Empire due to the Civil War, the western part was annexed to Poland in 1921, while the east became Soviet Belarus.\nThe Minsk region was established on 15 January 1938, based on the amendment of the Constitutional Law of the USSR. As of 20 February 1938, the area included 20 districts.  Following the Soviet invasion of Poland on September 17, 1939, the former Eastern lands of the Second Polish Republic were annexed in accordance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact partitioning Poland and added to the Minsk Region.\nOn 20 September 1944, by the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Gressky, Kopyl, Krasnoslobodski, Luban, Slutsky, Starobin, Starodorozhski districts and the city of Sluck were removed from the Minsk region and transferred to the newly formed Bobruisk Region.\nOn 8 January 1954, by the decree of the USSR Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the Nesvizhski and Stolbtsovsky districts from the abolished Baranovichi Region, as well as the Glusk, Gressky, Kopyl, Krasnoslobodski, Luban, Slutsky, Starobin, Starodorozhski districts and the city of Sluck from the abolished Bobruisk Region, were added to the Minsk Region.\nIn 1960, following the abolition of Molodechno Region, its southern part became the northern part of the Minsk Region.\n\nTourism\nThe number of travel agencies in Minsk Region grew from twelve in 2000 to seventy in 2010. The most popular tourist destinations of the region are Zaslavskoye Lake, the Zhdanovichi area which has health resorts, Nesvizh Palace and its surroundings, as well as the alpine ski resorts of Logoysk and Silichi.\n\nAdministrative subdivisions\nThe Minsk Region comprises 22 districts (raions), 307 selsovets, 22 cities, 8 city municipalities, and 20 urban-type settlements.\n\nDistricts of Minsk Region\nCities and towns\nPopulation of cities and towns in Minsk Region\n\nDemographics\nSee also\nAdministrative divisions of Belarus\nVillages in Minsk Region\nPassage 7:\nLarkin's Hundred\nLarkin's Hundred, also known as The Castle, is a historic home at Harwood, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, United States. It is a two-story brick house. Although tradition holds that it was built in 1704 by Thomas Larkin, a son of John Larkin of nearby Larkin's Hill Farm, evidence suggest it was actually constructed in the second quarter of the 18th century for Captain Joseph Cowman, a mariner and wealthy Quaker. A white clapboard kitchen wing at the west end was added in 1870. A noteworthy interior feature is a graceful stairway of American walnut.Larkin's Hundred was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969.\nPassage 8:\nPoplarville, Mississippi\nPoplarville is a city in Pearl River County, Mississippi, United States. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 2,894. It is the county seat of Pearl River County. It hosts an annual Blueberry Jubilee, which includes rides, craft vendors and rodeos.\n\nHistory\nPoplarville was named for Poplar Jim Smith, the original owner of the town site.In 1959, Mack Charles Parker, an African-American accused of rape, was abducted from the Pearl River County jail in Poplarville by a mob and shot to death. Despite confessions, no charges were filed against anyone. The mayor of Poplarville told a New York Times reporter, \"You couldn't convict the guilty parties if you had a sound film of the lynching.\" It was the fourth lynching in Poplarville since the Civil War. The case focused national attention on the persistence of lynching in the South and helped accelerate the American Civil Rights Movement.\nOn August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina inflicted heavy damage on the small town. The storm's most powerful, unofficially recorded gust of wind was reported at Pearl River Community College, at 135 mph (217 km/h). On September 2, 2005, the 1st Battalion, 134th Field Artillery (Ohio Army National Guard) arrived at the National Guard armory in Poplarville to assist the community and Pearl River County in recovery efforts in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.

Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\n\nThe following are given passages.\nPassage 1:\nEast Timor\nEast Timor ( (listen)), also known as Timor-Leste (; Portuguese pronunciation: [tiˈmoɾ ˈlɛʃtɨ]), officially the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, is a country in Southeast Asia. It comprises the eastern half of the island of Timor, of which the western half is administered by Indonesia, the exclave of Oecusse on the island's north-western half, and the minor islands of Atauro and Jaco. Australia is the country's southern neighbour, separated by the Timor Sea. The country's size is 14,874 square kilometres (5,743 sq mi). Dili is its capital and largest city.\nEast Timor came under Portuguese influence in the sixteenth century, remaining a Portuguese colony until 1975. Internal conflict preceded a unilateral declaration of independence and an Indonesian invasion and annexation. Resistance continued throughout Indonesian rule, and, in 1999, a United Nations–sponsored act of self-determination led to Indonesia relinquishing control of the territory. On 20 May 2002, as Timor-Leste, it became the first new sovereign state of the 21st century. That same year, relations with Indonesia were established and normalized, with Indonesia also supporting East Timor's accession into ASEAN. \nThe national government runs on a semi-presidential system, with the popularly elected president sharing power with a prime minister appointed by the National Parliament. Power is centralised under the national government, although many local leaders have informal influence. The country maintains a policy of international cooperation, and is a member of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, an observer of the Pacific Islands Forum, and an applicant for ASEAN membership. The country remains relatively poor, with an economy that relies heavily on natural resources, especially oil, and foreign aid.\nThe total population is over 1.1 million, and is heavily skewed towards young people due to a high fertility rate. Education has led to increasing literacy over the past half-century, especially in the two official languages of Portuguese and Tetum. High ethnic and linguistic diversity is reflected by the 30 indigenous languages spoken in the country. The majority of the population is Catholic, which exists alongside strong local traditions, especially in rural areas.\n\nName\n\"Timor\" is derived from timur, meaning 'east' in Malay, thus resulting in a tautological place name meaning 'East East'. In Indonesian, this results in the name Timor Timur  (this name only refers to the former de facto Indonesian province, Timor Leste is used instead to refer this country). In Portuguese, the country is called Timor-Leste (Leste meaning 'east'). In Tetum it is Timór Lorosa'e (Lorosa'e can be literally translated as 'where the sun rises').The official names under its constitution are \"Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste\" in English, \"República Democrática de Timor-Leste\" in Portuguese, and \"Repúblika Demokrátika Timór-Leste\" in Tetum. The official short form of the name is \"Timor-Leste\", and it uses the ISO codes TLS & TL.\n\nHistory\nPrehistory and Classical era\nCultural remains at Jerimalai on the eastern tip of East Timor have been dated to 42,000 years ago. The first known inhabitants are those who arrived during the Australo-Melanesian migration through the region, likely bringing the precursors to today's Papuan languages. A later migration of Austroasiatic-speakers is suspected, although no such languages remain. The arrival of Austronesian peoples brought new languages, and merged with existing cultures on the island. Timorese origin myths recount settlers sailing around the eastern end of the island before landing in the south. These people are sometimes noted as being from the Malay Peninsula or the Minangkabau highlands of Sumatra. Austronesian migration to Timor may be associated with the development of agriculture on the island.While information is limited about the political system of Timor during this period, the island had developed an interconnected series of polities governed by customary law. Small communities, centred around a particular sacred house, were part of wider sucos (or principalities), which were themselves part of larger kingdoms led by a liurai. Authority within these kingdoms was held by two individuals, with the worldly power of the liurai balanced by the spiritual power of a rai nain, who was generally associated with the primary sacred house of the kingdom. These polities were numerous and saw shifting alliances and relations, but many were stable enough that they survived from initial European documentation in the 16th century until the end of Portuguese rule.: 11–15 From perhaps the thirteenth century, the island exported sandalwood,: 267  which was valued both for its use in crafting and as a source of perfume. Timor was included in Southeast Asian, Chinese, and Indian trading networks by the fourteenth century, exporting sandalwood, honey, and wax. The island was recorded by the Majapahit Empire as a source of tribute.: 89  It was sandalwood that attracted European explorers to the island in the early sixteenth century. Early European presence was limited to trade, with the first Portuguese settlement being on the nearby island of Solor.: 90\n\nPortuguese era (1769–1975)\nEarly Portuguese presence on Timor was very limited; trade was directed through Portuguese settlements on nearby islands. Only in the 17th century did they establish a more direct presence on the island, a consequence of being driven out of other islands by the Dutch.: 267  After Solor was lost in 1613 the Portuguese moved to Flores. In 1646 the capital moved to Kupang on Timor's west, before Kupang too was lost to the Dutch in 1652. The Portuguese then moved to Lifau, in what is now East Timor's Oecusse exclave.: 90  Effective European occupation in the east of the island only began in 1769, when the city of Dili was founded, although actual control remained highly limited. A definitive border between the Dutch and Portuguese parts of the island was established by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in 1914 and remains the international boundary between the successor states Indonesia and East Timor, respectively.For the Portuguese, East Timor remained little more than a neglected trading post, with minimal investment in infrastructure and education, until the late nineteenth century. Even when Portugal established actual control over the interior of its colony, investment remained minimal.: 269, 273  Sandalwood continued to be the main export crop and coffee exports became significant in the mid-nineteenth century.At the beginning of the twentieth century, a faltering domestic economy prompted the Portuguese to extract greater wealth from its colonies, which was met with East Timorese resistance. The colony was seen as an economic burden during the Great Depression and received little support or management from Portugal.: 269 During World War II, Dili was occupied by the Allies in 1941, and later by the Japanese beginning in 1942. The mountainous interior of the colony became the scene of a guerrilla campaign, known as the Battle of Timor. Waged by East Timorese volunteers and Allied forces against the Japanese, the struggle killed between 40,000 and 70,000 East Timorese civilians. The Japanese eventually drove the last of the Australian and Allied forces out in early 1943. Portuguese control resumed, however, after Japanese surrender at the end of World War II.Portugal began investment in the colony in the 1950s, funding education and promoting coffee exports, but the economy did not improve substantially and infrastructure improvements were limited.: 269  Growth rates remained low, near 2%. Following the 1974 Portuguese revolution, Portugal effectively abandoned its colony in Timor, and civil war between East Timorese political parties broke out in 1975.\nThe Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (Fretilin) resisted a Timorese Democratic Union (UDT) coup attempt in August 1975, and unilaterally declared independence on 28 November 1975. Fearing a communist state within the Indonesian archipelago, the Indonesian military launched an invasion of East Timor in December 1975. Indonesia declared East Timor its 27th province on 17 July 1976. The United Nations Security Council opposed the invasion, and the territory's nominal status in the UN remained as \"non-self-governing territory under Portuguese administration\".\n\nIndonesian occupation (1975–1999)\nFretilin resisted the invasion, initially as an army, holding territory until November 1978, and then as a guerrilla resistance. The Indonesian occupation of Timor was marked by violence and brutality. A detailed statistical report prepared for the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor cited a minimum of 102,800 conflict-related deaths in the period between 1974 and 1999, including approximately 18,600 killings and 84,200 excess deaths from hunger and illness. The total number of conflict-related deaths during this period is difficult to determine due to a lack of data. One estimate based on Portuguese, Indonesian, and Catholic Church data suggests it may have been as high as 200,000. Repression and restrictions counteracted improvements in health and education infrastructure and services, meaning there was little overall improvement in living standards; economic growth mostly benefited immigrants from elsewhere in Indonesia.: 271  A huge expansion of education was intended to increase Indonesian language use and internal security as much as it was for development.The 1991 massacre of more than 200 demonstrators by the Indonesian military was a turning point for the independence cause, and brought increased international pressure on Indonesia. Following the resignation of Indonesian President Suharto, the new President BJ Habibie, prompted by a letter from Australian Prime Minister John Howard, decided to hold a referendum on independence. A UN-sponsored agreement between Indonesia and Portugal allowed for a UN-supervised popular referendum in August 1999. A clear vote for independence was met with a punitive campaign of violence by East Timorese pro-integration militias supported by elements of the Indonesian military. In response, the Indonesian government allowed a multinational peacekeeping force, INTERFET, to restore order and aid East Timorese refugees and internally displaced persons. On 25 October 1999, the administration of East Timor was taken over by the UN through the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). INTERFET deployment ended in February 2000 with the transfer of military command to the UN.\n\nContemporary era\nOn 30 August 2001, the East Timorese voted in their first election organised by the UN to elect members of the Constituent Assembly. On 22 March 2002, the Constituent Assembly approved the Constitution. By May 2002, more than 205,000 refugees had returned. On 20 May 2002, the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of East Timor came into force and East Timor was recognised as independent by the UN. The Constituent Assembly was renamed the National Parliament, and Xanana Gusmão was elected as the country's first president. On 27 September 2002 the country became a UN member state.In 2006, a crisis of unrest and factional fighting forced 155,000 people to flee their homes; the United Nations sent in security forces to restore order. The following year, Gusmão declined to run for another term. While there were minor incidents in the build-up to the mid-year presidential elections, the process was peaceful overall and José Ramos-Horta was elected president. In June 2007, Gusmão ran in the parliamentary elections and became prime minister at the head of the National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction (CNRT) party. In February 2008, Ramos-Horta was critically injured in an attempted assassination; Prime Minister Gusmão also faced gunfire separately but escaped unharmed. Australian reinforcements were immediately sent to help keep order. In March 2011, the UN handed over operational control of the police force to the East Timor authorities. The United Nations ended its peacekeeping mission on 31 December 2012.Francisco Guterres of the centre-left Fretilin party became president in May 2017. The leader of Fretilin, Mari Alkatiri, formed a coalition government after the July 2017 parliamentary election. This government soon fell, leading to a second general election in May 2018. In June 2018, former president and independence fighter, Taur Matan Ruak, became the new prime minister. José Ramos-Horta again became president on 20 May 2022 after winning the April 2022 presidential election runoff against Francisco Guterres.\n\nPolitics and government\nThe political system of East Timor is semi-presidential, based upon the Portuguese system.: 175  The constitution establishes both this separation of executive powers between the president and the prime minister; and the separation of powers between the executive, legislature, and judiciary.: 12  Individuals are not allowed to participate in both the legislature and the executive branch. The legislature is intended to provide a check on the executive; in practice the executive has maintained control of the legislature under all political parties, reflecting the dominance of individual leaders within political parties and coalitions.: 174  The executive, through the council of ministers, also holds some formal legislative powers.: 175  The judiciary operates independently, although there are instances of executive interference.: 13, 39  Some courts shift between locations, to improve access for those in more isolated areas. Despite political rhetoric, the constitution and democratic institutions have been followed by politicians, and changes of government are peaceful.: 15, 42  Elections are run by an independent body,: 216  and turnout is high, ranging from around 70% to 85%.: 17  The political system has wide public acceptance.: 17 : 106 The head of state of East Timor is the president of the republic, who is elected by popular vote for a five-year term,: 244  and can serve a maximum of two terms. Formally, the directly elected president holds relatively limited powers compared to those in similar systems, with no power over the appointment and dismissal of the prime minister and the council of ministers. However, as they are directly elected, past presidents have wielded great informal power and influence.: 175  The president does have the power to veto government legislation, initiate referendums, and to dissolve parliament in the event that it is unable to form a government or pass a budget.: 244  If the president vetoes a legislative action, the parliament can overturn the veto with a two-thirds majority.: 10  The prime minister is chosen by the parliament, with the president appointing the leader of the majority party or coalition as prime minister of East Timor and the cabinet on the proposal of the latter.: 10  As head of government, the prime minister presides over the cabinet.\n\nRepresentatives in the unicameral National Parliament are elected by popular vote to a five-year term. The number of seats can vary from a minimum of fifty-two to a maximum of sixty-five. Parties must achieve 3% of the vote to enter parliament, with seats for qualifying parties allocated using the D'Hondt method. Elections occur within the framework of a competitive multi-party system. Upon independence, power was held by the Fretilin political party, which was formed shortly before the Indonesian invasion and led its resistance. Given its history, Fretilin viewed itself as the natural party of government and supported a multi-party system, expecting the development of a dominant-party system. Support from the United Nations and the international community, both before and after independence, allowed the nascent political system to survive shocks such as the 2006 crisis.: 173 Candidates in parliamentary elections run in a single national district in a party-list system. One in three of all candidates presented by political parties must be women. This system promotes a diversity of political parties, but gives voters little influence over the individual candidates selected by each party.: 175–176  Women hold more than a third of parliamentary seats, with parties required by law to run female candidates, but they are less prominent at other levels and within party leadership.Political divisions exist along class lines and along geographical lines. There is broadly a divide between eastern and western areas of the country, stemming from differences that arose under Indonesian rule. Fretilin in particular is strongly linked to the Eastern areas.: 176–177  Political parties are more closely associated with prominent personalities more than with ideology.: 16  The National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction became the main opposition to Fretilin, following its establishment to allow Xanana Gusmão to run for Prime Minister in the 2007 parliamentary elections.: 168–169  While both major parties have been relatively stable, they remain led by an \"old guard\" of individuals who came to prominence during the resistance against Indonesia.: 175 : 10–11 Politics and administration is centred in the capital Dili, with the national government responsible for most civil services.: 9, 36  Oecusse, separated from the rest of the country by Indonesian territory, is a special administrative region with some autonomy.: 180  The National Police of East Timor and Timor Leste Defence Force have held a monopoly on violence since 2008 and very few guns are present outside of these organisations.: 8  While there are allegations of abuse of power, there is some judicial oversight of police and public trust in the institution has grown. An active civil society functions independently of the government, as do media outlets.: 11–12  Civil society organisations are concentrated in the capital, including student groups. Due to the structure of the economy, there are no powerful trade unions.: 17  The Catholic Church has strong influence in the country.: 40\n\nForeign relations and military\nInternational cooperation has always been important to East Timor; donor funds made up 80% of the budget before oil revenues began to replace them.: 42–44  International forces also provided security, with five UN missions sent to the country from 1999. The final one, the United Nations Integrated Mission in East Timor, began after the 2006 East Timorese crisis and concluded in 2012.: 4, 14 East Timor formally applied to join ASEAN in 2011,: 42–44  and was granted observer status and accepted \"in principle\" in November 2022. Despite the nationalist political leadership promoting closer ties with Melanesian states, the country has targeted ASEAN membership since before its independence, with its leaders stating that joining Pacific bodies would have precluded ASEAN membership. ASEAN membership was sought for economic and security reasons, including to improve the relationship with Indonesia. Nonetheless, the process has been slow due to a lack of support from some ASEAN states.: 10–11  East Timor is thus an observer to the Pacific Islands Forum and the Melanesian Spearhead Group. More broadly, the country is a leader within the Group of Seven Plus (g7+), an organisation of fragile states. It is also a member of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries.: 42–44 Continuing bilateral donors include Australia, Portugal, Germany, and Japan, and East Timor has a reputation for effectively and transparently using donor funds. Good relations with Australia and with Indonesia are a policy goal for the government, despite historical and more-recent tensions. These countries are important economic partners and provide most transport links to the country.: 42–44  China has also increased its presence by contributing to infrastructure in Dili.: 12 The relationship with Australia was dominated from before independence by disputes over natural resources in the ocean between them, hampering the establishment of a mutually agreed border. The dominance of Australian hard power led East Timor to utilise public diplomacy and forums for international law to push their case. The dispute was resolved in 2018 following negotiations at the Permanent Court of Arbitration, when a maritime boundary between the two was established along with an agreement on natural resource revenues.The Timor Leste Defence Force (F-FDTL) was established in 2001, replacing Falintil, and was restructured following the events of 2006. It is responsible not only for safeguarding against external threats, but also for addressing violent crime, a role it shares with the National Police of East Timor. These forces remain small: 2,200 soldiers in the regular army and 80 in a naval component. A single aircraft and seven patrol boats are operated, and there are plans to expand the naval component. There is some military cooperation with Australia, Portugal, and the United States.\n\nAdministrative divisions\nEast Timor is divided into fourteen municipalities, which in turn are subdivided into 64 administrative posts, 442 sucos (villages), and 2,225 aldeias (hamlets). The municipalities are: Aileu, Ainaro, Atauro, Baucau, Bobonaro, Cova Lima, Dili, Ermera, Lautém, Liquiçá, Manatuto, Manufahi, Oecusse, and Viqueque.The existing system of municipalities and administrative posts was established during Portuguese rule.: 3  While decentralisation is mentioned in the constitution, administrative powers generally remain with the national government operating out of Dili.: 2  Upon independence there was debate about how to implement decentralisation; various proposed models would create different levels of administration between the sucos and the central government. In most proposals, there were no specific provisions for suco-level governance, and they were expected to continue to exist as mostly traditional spaces, identifying communities rather than being part of the civil administration. In the end, the existing districts were kept and renamed municipalities in 2009, and received very few powers.: 88–92  In 2016 changes were made so that each municipality is led by a civil servant appointed by the central government. This civil servant is advised by locally elected leaders.: 4, 7  The isolated Oecusse municipality, which has a strong identity and is fully surrounded by Indonesian territory, is specified by Articles 5 and 71 of the 2002 constitution to be governed by a special administrative policy and economic regime. Law 3/2014 of 18 June 2014 implemented this constitutional provision, which went into effect in January 2015, turning Oecusse into a Special Administrative Region. The region began operating its own civil service in June 2015. In January 2022 the island of Atauro, formerly an Administrative Post of Dili, became its own municipality.Administration in the lowest levels of the administrative system of East Timor, the aldeias and sucos, generally reflects traditional customs,: 1  reflecting community identity and relationships between local households.: 4  Sucos generally contain 2,000 to 3,000 inhabitants. Their long persistence and links to local governance means the sucos are the level of government that is linked to community identities, rather than any high level of administration.: 89  Such relationships, however, are associated specifically with the kinship groups within that land, rather than the land itself.: 52–53  Relationships between sucos also reflect customary practices, for example through the reciprocal exchanging of support for local initiatives.: 9  Laws passed in 2004 provided for the election of some suco officials, but assigned these positions no formal powers. An updated law in 2009 established the expected mandate of these positions, although it continued to leave them outside of the formal state system, reliant on municipal governments to provide formal administration and services.: 94–97  Further clarification was given in 2016, which entrenched the treatment of sucos and aldeias more as communities than formal levels of administration. Despite this lack of formal association with the state, suco leaders hold great influence and are often seen by their community as representatives of the state. They have responsibilities usually associated with civic administration.: 7–10\n\nGeography\nLocated in between Southeast Asia and the South Pacific,: 2  the island of Timor is the largest of the Lesser Sunda Islands, which lie within the Malay archipelago.: 1  The island is surrounded by the Ombai and Wetar Straits of the rougher Banda Sea in the north, and the calmer Timor Sea in the south.: 2  East Timor shares the island with Indonesia, with Indonesian territory separating the Oecusse exclave from the rest of the country. The island of Atauro lies north of the mainland,: 2  with the fourth area being the small island of Jaco. The Savu Sea lies north of Oecusse.: 1  The country is about 265 kilometres (165 mi) long and 97 kilometres (60 mi) wide, with a total land area of 14,874 square kilometres (5,743 sq mi).: 1  This territory is situated between 8′15S – 10′30S latitude and 125′50E – 127′30E longitude.: 2  The country's coastline covers around 700 kilometres (430 mi),: 27  while the main land border with Indonesia is 125 kilometres (78 mi) long, and the Oecusse land border is around 100 kilometres (62 mi) long.: 1  Maritime borders exist with Australia to the south and Indonesia elsewhere. East Timor has an exclusive economic zone of 77,051 km2 (29,750 sq mi).The interior of the country is mountainous,: 2  with ridges of inactive volcanic mountains extending along the island.: 2  Almost half of the country has a slope of at least 40%. The south is slightly less mountainous, and has some plains near the coastline.: 2  The highest point is Tatamailau (also known as Mount Ramelau) at 2,963 metres (9,721 ft). Most rivers dry up at least partially during the dry season.: 2  Outside of some coastal areas and river valleys, the soil is shallow and prone to erosion, and its quality is poor.: 13 : 2  The capital and largest city is Dili. The second-largest city is the eastern town of Baucau.: 22 \n\nThe climate is tropical with relatively stable temperatures throughout the year. A wet season lasts from December to May throughout the country, and lasts slightly longer in the south: 5  and the interior due to the effect of a monsoon from Australia.: 2  During this period, rainfall can reach 222–252 millimetres (8.7–9.9 in) per month. In the dry season, it drops to 12–18 millimetres (0.47–0.71 in).: 5  The country is vulnerable to flooding and landslides that occur as a result of heavy rain, especially when rainfall levels are increased by the La Niña effect.: 13  The mountainous interior is cooler than the coasts. Coastal areas are heavily dependent on groundwater, which faces pressure from mismanagement, deforestation, and climate change.: 14  While the temperature is thought to have experienced a small increase due to climate change, there has been little change in annual rainfall.: 6 Coastal ecosystems around the country are diverse and varied, with vary spatially between the north and south coastlines, as well as between the eastern tip and areas more to the west. These ecosystems include coral reefs, as the country's waters are part of the Coral Triangle biodiversity hotspot.: 28  The easternmost area of East Timor consists of the Paitchau Range and the Lake Ira Lalaro area, which contains the country's first conservation area, the Nino Konis Santana National Park. It contains the last remaining tropical dry forested area within the country. It hosts a number of unique plant and animal species and is sparsely populated. The northern coast is characterised by a number of coral reef systems that have been determined to be at risk.There are around 41,000 terrestrial plant species in the country. Forests covered 35% of East Timor's land in the mid 2010s.: 1  The forests of the northern coast, central uplands, and southern coast are distinct.: 2  East Timor is home to the Timor and Wetar deciduous forests ecoregion. There is some environmental protection in law, but it has not been a government priority.: 27 : 10–14  In addition to climate change, local ecosystems are threatened by deforestation, land degradation, overfishing, and pollution.: 2–3\n\nEconomy\nThe economy of East Timor is a market economy, although it is dependent upon the export of a few commodities and has a large public sector. Internally, market operations are limited by widespread poverty.: 20  The country uses the United States dollar, producing its own coins to facilitate smaller transactions. The economy is generally open to foreign investment, although a prohibition on foreigners owning land means many require a local partner in the country.: 20  Competition is limited by the small size of the economy, rather than any government barriers. There are far more imports than exports,: 21  and prices for goods are often higher than in nearby countries.: 27  Inflation is strongly affected by government spending.: 257  Growth has been slow, averaging just 2.5% per year from 2011 to 2021.: 24 Most of the country is very poor, with just more than 40% living under the national poverty line. This poverty is especially prevalent in rural areas, where many are subsistence farmers or fishermen. Even in urban areas, the majority are poor. Overall, women are poorer than men, often being employed in lower-paying careers.: 18  Malnutrition is common, with over half of children showing stunted growth.: 255  While 91% of married working age (15–49) men were employed as of 2016, only 43% of married working age women were. There are small disparities in favour of men in terms of home and land ownership and owning a bank account.: 14  The eastern three municipalities, which contain around a quarter of the population, has less poverty than the western areas, which contain 50% of the population.: 214 Sixty-six per cent of families are in part supported by subsistence activities; however, the country as a whole does not produce enough food to be self-sustaining, and thus relies on imports.: 16  Agricultural work carries the implication of poverty, and the sector receives little investment from the government.: 260  Ninety-four per cent of domestic fish catch comes from the ocean, especially coastal fisheries.: 17  Those in the capital of Dili are on average better off, although they remain poor by international standards.: 257  The small size of the private sector means the government is often the customer of public businesses. A quarter of the national population works in the informal economy, with the official public and private sectors employing 9% each.: 18  Of those of working age, around 23% are in the formal sector, 21% are students, and 27% are subsistence farmers and fishers.: 21  The economy is mostly cash-based, with little commercial credit available from banks.: 11–12  Remittances from overseas workers add up to around $100 million annually.: 257 \n\nThis poverty belies significant wealth in terms of natural resources, which at the time of independence had per capita value equivalent to the wealth of an upper-middle income country. Over half of this was in oil, and over a quarter natural gas. The Timor-Leste Petroleum Fund was established in 2005 to turn these non-renewable resources into a more sustainable form of wealth.: 4–6  From 2005 to 2021, $23 billion earned from oil sales has entered the fund. $8 billion has been generated from investments, while $12 billion has been spent.: 30  A decrease in oil and gas reserves led to decreasing HDI beginning in 2010.: 18–19  Eighty per cent of government spending comes from this fund, which as of 2021 had $19 billion, 10 times greater than the size of the national budget. As oil income has decreased, the fund is at risk of being exhausted. Withdrawals have exceeded sustainable levels almost every year since 2009.: 23  Resources within the Bayu-Undan field are expected to soon run out, while extracting those within the so far undeveloped Greater Sunrise field has proven technically and politically challenging. Remaining potential reserves are also losing value as oil and gas become less favoured sources of energy.: 264–272 The country's economy is dependent on government spending and, to a lesser extent, assistance from foreign donors. Government spending decreased beginning in 2012, which had knock-on effects in the private sector over the following years. The government and its state-owned oil company often invest in large private projects. Decreasing government spending was matched with a decrease in GDP growth.: 18  After the petroleum fund, the second largest source of government income is taxes. Tax revenue is less than 8% of GDP, lower than many other countries in the region and with similarly sized economies. Other government income comes from 23 \"autonomous agencies\", which include port authorities, infrastructure companies, and the National University of East Timor.: 13, 28–309  Overall, government spending remains among the highest in the world,: 12  although investment into education, health, and water infrastructure is negligible.: 260 \n\nPrivate sector development has lagged due to human capital shortages, infrastructure weakness, an incomplete legal system, and an inefficient regulatory environment. Property rights remain ill-defined, with conflicting titles from Portuguese and Indonesian rule, as well as needing to accommodate traditional customary rights.: 23  As of 2010, 87.7% of urban (321,043 people) and 18.9% of rural (821,459 people) households have electricity, for an overall average of 38.2%. The private sector shrank between 2014 and 2018, despite a growing working age population. Agriculture and manufacturing are less productive per capita than at independence.: 255–256  Non-oil economic sectors have failed to develop, and growth in construction and administration is dependent on oil revenue.: 256  The dependence on oil shows some aspects of a resource curse. Coffee made up 90% of all non-fossil fuel exports from 2013 to 2019, with all such exports totalling to around US$20 million annually.: 257  In 2017, the country was visited by 75,000 tourists.\n\nDemographics\nEast Timor recorded a population of 1,183,643 in its 2015 census. The population lives mainly along the coastline, where all urban areas are located.: 27  Those in urban areas generally have more formal education, employment prospects, and healthcare. While a strong gender disparity exists throughout the country, it is less severe in the urban capital. The wealthy minority often go abroad for health, education and other purposes.: 25  The population is young, with the median age being under 20.: 29  In particular, a large proportion of the population (almost 45% in 2015) are males between the ages of 15 and 24, the third largest male 'youth bulge' in the world.: 212 The Government of Timor-Leste's website lists the English-language demonym for East Timor as Timorese. Other reference sources list it as East Timorese. The word Maubere formerly used by the Portuguese to refer to native East Timorese and often employed as synonymous with the illiterate and uneducated, was adopted by Fretilin as a term of pride.Healthcare received 6% of the national budget in 2021.: 24  From 1990 to 2019 life expectancy rose from 48.5 to 69.5. Expected years of schooling rose from 9.8 to 12.4 between 2000 and 2010, while mean years of schooling rose from 2.8 to 4.4. Progress since 2010 for these has been limited. Gross national income per capita similarly peaked in 2010, and has decreased since.: 3  As of 2016, 45.8% of East Timorese were impoverished, 16.3% severely so.: 6  The fertility rate, which at the time of independence was the highest in the world at 7.8, dropped to 4.2 by 2016. It is relatively higher in rural areas, and among poorer: 3  and less literate households. As of 2016, the average household size was 5.3, with 41% of people aged under 15, and 18% of households headed by women.: 2  Infant mortality stood at 30 per 1,000, down from 60 per 1,000 in 2003.: 7  46% of children under 5 showed stunted growth, down from 58% in 2010. Working age adult obesity increased from 5% to 10% during the same time period. As of 2016, 40% of children, 23% of women, and 13% of men had anemia.: 11\n\nEthnicity and language\nTimorese communities are not strictly defined by ethnic background or linguistic group. Separate communities may share ethnicity or language, and many areas show overlaps and hybridisation between ethnic and linguistic groups.: 44  Familial relations and descent, which are interlinked with sacred house affiliation, are a more important indicator of identity.: 47  Each family group generally identifies with a single language or dialect.: 49  With this immense local variation in mind, there is a broad cultural and identity distinction between the east (Bacau, Lautém, and Viqueque Municipalities) and the west of the country, a product of history more than it is of linguistic and ethnic differences,: 45–47  although it is very loosely associated with the two language groups.: 142–143  There is a small mestiço population of mixed Portuguese and local descent. There is a small Chinese minority, most of whom are Hakka. Many Chinese left in the mid-1970s, but a significant number have also returned to East Timor following the end of Indonesian occupation. East Timor has a small community of Timorese Indian, specifically Goan descent, as well as historical immigration from Africa and Yemen.Likely reflecting the mixed origins of the different ethnolinguistic groups of the island, the indigenous languages fall into two language families: Austronesian and Papuan.: 10  Depending on how they are classified, there are up to 19 indigenous languages with up to 30 dialects.: 136  Aside from Tetum, Ethnologue lists the following indigenous languages: Adabe, Baikeno, Bunak, Fataluku, Galoli, Habun, Idaté, Kairui-Midiki, Kemak, Lakalei, Makasae, Makuv'a, Mambae, Nauete, Tukudede, and Waima'a. According to the Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger, there are six endangered languages in East Timor: Adabe, Habu, Kairui-Midiki, Maku'a, Naueti, and Waima'a. The largest Malayo-Polynesian group is the Tetum, mostly around Dili or the western border. Other Malayo-Polynesian languages with native speakers of more than 40,000 are Mambai in the central mountains south of Dili, Baikeno in Oecusse, Kemak in the north-west interior, and Tokodede on the northwest coast. The main Papuan languages spoken are Bunak in the centre of Timor, especially within Bobonaro Municipality; Makasae in the eastern Baucau and Viqueque municipalities; and Fataluku in the eastern Lautém Municipality.: 43  The 2015 census found that the most commonly spoken mother tongues were Tetum Prasa (mother tongue for 30.6% of the population), Mambai (16.6%), Makasai (10.5%), Tetum Terik (6.05%), Baikenu (5.87%), Kemak (5.85%), Bunak (5.48%), Tokodede (3.97%), and Fataluku (3.52%). Other indigenous languages accounted for 10.47%, while 1.09% of the population spoke foreign languages natively.East Timor's two official languages are Portuguese and Tetum. In addition, English and Indonesian are designated by the constitution as \"working languages\".: 3  This is within the Final and Transitional Provisions, which do not set a final date. In 2012, 35% could speak, read, and write Portuguese, which is up significantly from less than 5% in the 2006 UN Development Report. Portuguese is recovering as it has now been made the main official language of Timor, and is being taught in most schools. The use of Portuguese for government information and in the court system provides some barriers to access for those who do not speak it. Tetum is also not understood by everyone in the country.: 11  According to the Observatory of the Portuguese Language, the East Timorese literacy rate was 77.8% in Tetum, 55.6% in Indonesian, and 39.3% in Portuguese, and that the primary literacy rate increased from 73% in 2009 to 83% in 2012. According to the 2015 census, 50% of the population between the ages of 14 and 24 can speak and understand Portuguese. The 2015 census found around 15% of those over the age of five were literate in English.\n\nEducation\nEast Timor's adult literacy rate was 68% among adults, and 84% among those aged 15–24, as of 2021. It is slightly higher among women than men.: 27  More girls than boys attend school, although some drop out upon reaching puberty.: 25  As of 2016 22% of working age women (15–49) and 19% of working age men had no education, 15% of women and 18% of men had some primary education, 52% of women and 51% of men had some secondary education, and 11% of women and 12% of men had higher education. Overall, 75% of women and 82% of men were literate.: 2  Primary schools exist throughout the country, although the quality of materials and teaching is often poor. Secondary schools are generally limited to municipal capitals. Education takes up 10% of the national budget.: 27  The country's main university is the National University of East Timor. There are also four colleges.Since independence, both Indonesian and Tetum have lost ground as media of instruction, while Portuguese has increased: in 2001 only 8.4% of primary school and 6.8% of secondary school students attended a Portuguese-medium school; by 2005 this had increased to 81.6% for primary and 46.3% for secondary schools. Indonesian formerly played a considerable role in education, being used by 73.7% of all secondary school students as a medium of instruction, but by 2005 Portuguese was used by most schools in Baucau, Manatuto, as well as the capital district. Portugal provides support to about 3% of the public schools in East Timor, focused on those in urban areas, further encouraging the use of the Portuguese language.: 28\n\nReligion\nWhile the Constitution of East Timor enshrines the principles of freedom of religion and separation of church and state, Section 45 Comma 1 also acknowledges \"the participation of the Catholic Church in the process of national liberation\" in its preamble. Upon independence, the country joined the Philippines to become the only two predominantly Catholic states in Asia, although nearby parts of eastern Indonesia such as Flores and parts of Western New Guinea also have Catholic majorities.According to the 2015 census, 97.57% of the population is Catholic; 1.96% Protestant; 0.24% Muslim; 0.08% Traditional; 0.05% Buddhist; 0.02% Hindu, and 0.08% other religions. A 2016 survey conducted by the Demographic and Health Survey programme showed that Catholics made up 98.3% of the population, Protestants 1.2%, and Muslims 0.3%.The number of churches grew from 100 in 1974 to more than 800 in 1994, with Church membership having grown considerably under Indonesian rule as Pancasila, Indonesia's state ideology, requires all citizens to believe in one God and does not recognise traditional beliefs. East Timorese animist belief systems did not fit with Indonesia's constitutional monotheism, resulting in mass conversions to Christianity. Portuguese clergy were replaced with Indonesian priests and Latin and Portuguese mass was replaced by Indonesian mass. While just 20% of East Timorese called themselves Catholics at the time of the 1975 invasion, the figure surged to reach 95% by the end of the first decade after the invasion. The Roman Catholic Church divides East Timor into three dioceses: the Archdiocese of Díli, the Diocese of Baucau, and the Diocese of Maliana. In rural areas, Roman Catholicism is syncretised with local animist beliefs. The number of Protestants and Muslims declined significantly after September 1999, as these groups were disproportionately represented among supporters of integration with Indonesia. Fewer than half of previous Protestant congregations existed after September 1999, and many Protestants were among those who remained in West Timor.\n\nCulture\nThe many cultures within East Timor stem from the several waves of Austronesian and Melanesian migration that led to the current population, with unique identities and traditions developing within each petty kingdom. Portuguese authorities built upon traditional structures, blending Portuguese influence into the existing political and social systems.: 91–92  The presence of the Catholic Church created a point of commonality across the various ethnic groups, despite full conversion remaining limited. The Portuguese language also provided common linkages, even if direct Portuguese impact was limited.: 97–98  Under Indonesian rule, resistance strengthened cultural links to Catholicism and the Portuguese language. At the same time, Indonesian cultural influence was spread through schools and administration.: 98–99 The preservation of traditional beliefs in the face of Indonesian attempts to suppress them became linked to the creation of the country's national identity.: 7–13  This national identity only began to emerge at the very end of Portuguese rule, and further developed during Indonesian rule.: 134–136  Following independence, a civic identity began to develop. This was most clearly expressed through enthusiasm for national-level democracy,: 155–156  and was reflected in politics through a shift from resistance narratives to development ones.: 3  The capital has developed a more cosmopolitan culture, while rural areas maintain stronger traditional practices.: 30  Internal migration into urban areas, especially Dili, creates cultural links between these areas and rural hinterlands. Those in urban areas often continue to identify with a specific rural area, even those with multiple generations born in Dili.: 53–54 The presence of so many ethnic and linguistic groups means cultural practices vary across the country.: 11  These practices reflect historical social structures and practices, where political leaders were regarded as having spiritual powers. Ancestry was an important part of cultural practices, and partly signified leadership. Leaders often had influence over land use, and these leaders continue to play an informal role in land disputes and other aspects of community practice today. An important traditional concept is lulik, or sacredness. Some lulik ceremonies continue to reflect animist beliefs, for example through divination ceremonies which vary throughout the country. Sacred status can also be associated with objects, such as Portuguese flags which have been passed down within families.: 7–13 \n\nCommunity life is centred around sacred houses (Uma Lulik), physical structures which serve as a representative symbol and identifier for each community.: 47–49  The architectural style of these houses varies between different parts of the country, although following widespread destruction by Indonesian forces many were rebuilt with cheap modern materials.: 22–25  The house as a concept extends beyond the physical object to the surrounding community.: 92–93, 96  Kinship systems exist within and between houses. Traditional leaders, who stem from historically important families, retain key roles in administering justice and resolving disputes through methods that vary between communities.: 47–49  Such leaders are often elected to official leadership positions, merging cultural and historical status with modern political status.: 52  The concept of being part of a communal house has been extended to the nation, with Parliament serving as the national sacred house.: 96 Art styles vary throughout the various ethnolinguistic groups of the island. Nonetheless, similar artistic motifs are present throughout, such as large animals and particular geometric patterns. Some art is traditionally associated with particular genders. For example, the Tais textiles that play a widespread role in traditional life throughout the island are traditionally handwoven by women. Different tais patterns are associated with different communities, and more broadly with linguistic groups.: 137  Many buildings within central Dili maintain historical Portuguese architecture.: I-5 Traditional rituals remain important, often mixed in with more modern aspects.: 137  A strong oral history is highlighted in individuals able to recite long stories or poetry. This history, or Lia nain, passes down traditional knowledge.: 16  There remains a strong tradition of poetry. Prime Minister Xanana Gusmão, for example, is a distinguished poet, earning the moniker \"poet warrior\".In the field of cinema, East Timor released its first feature-length film, a period thriller titled Beatriz's War, in 2013. Shot with a limited budget by a mix of local filmmakers and a volunteer Australian film crew, the film depicted East Timorese life under Indonesian occupation in the 1970s, with producer Lurdes Pires acknowledging their aim to diverge from the government's \"friendship and forgiveness\" policy for its past conflicts by telling a story of truth-seeking and justice.\n\nSee also\nOutline of East Timor\nIndex of East Timor-related articles\nList of topics on the Portuguese Empire in the East\nPassage 2:\nDutch Republic\nThe United Provinces of the Netherlands, officially the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands (Dutch: Republiek der Zeven Verenigde Nederlanden), and commonly referred to in historiography as the Dutch Republic, was a confederation that existed from 1579 until the Batavian Revolution in 1795. It was a predecessor state of the present-day Netherlands. The republic was established after seven Dutch provinces in the Spanish Netherlands revolted against Spanish rule, forming a mutual alliance against Spain in 1579 (the Union of Utrecht) and declaring their independence in 1581 (the Act of Abjuration). It comprised Groningen, Frisia, Overijssel, Guelders, Utrecht, Holland and Zeeland.\nAlthough the state was small and contained only around 1.5 million inhabitants, it controlled a worldwide network of seafaring trade routes. Through its trading companies, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and the Dutch West India Company (GWC), it established a Dutch colonial empire. The income from this trade allowed the Dutch Republic to compete militarily against much larger countries. It amassed a huge fleet of 2,000 ships, initially larger than the fleets of England and France combined. Major conflicts were fought in the Eighty Years' War against Spain (from the foundation of the Dutch Republic until 1648), the Dutch–Portuguese War (1602–1663), four Anglo-Dutch Wars (the first against the Commonwealth of England, two against the Kingdom of England, and a fourth against the Kingdom of Great Britain: 1652–1654, 1665–1667, 1672–1674 and 1780–1784), the Franco-Dutch War (1672–1678), War of the Grand Alliance (1688–1697), the War of the Spanish Succession (1702–1713), the War of Austrian Succession (1744–1748) and the War of the First Coalition (1792–1795) against the Kingdom of France.\nThe republic was more tolerant of different religions and ideas than its contemporary states were, allowing freedom of thought to its residents. Artists flourished under this regime, including painters such as Rembrandt, Johannes Vermeer and many others. So did scientists, such as Hugo Grotius, Christiaan Huygens and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. The Dutch trade, science, military, and art were among the most acclaimed in the world during much of the 17th century, a period which became known in Dutch history as the Dutch Golden Age.\nThe republic was a confederation of provinces each with a high degree of independence from the federal assembly, known as the States General. In the Peace of Westphalia (1648) the republic gained approximately 20% more territory, located outside the member provinces, which was ruled directly by the States General as Generality Lands. Each province was led by an official known as the stadtholder (Dutch for 'steward'); this office was nominally open to anyone, but most provinces appointed a member of the House of Orange. The position gradually became hereditary, with the Prince of Orange simultaneously holding most or all of the stadtholderships, making him effectively the head of state. This created tension between political factions: the Orangists favoured a powerful stadtholder, while the Republicans favoured a strong States General. The Republicans forced two Stadtholderless Periods, 1650–1672 and 1702–1747, with the latter causing national instability and the end of Great Power status.\nEconomic decline led to a period of political instability known as the Patriottentijd (1780–1787). This unrest was temporarily suppressed by a Prussian invasion in support of the stadtholder. The French Revolution and subsequent War of the First Coalition caused these tensions to reignite. Following military defeat by France, the stadtholder was expelled in the Batavian Revolution of 1795. This ended the Dutch Republic; it was succeeded by the Batavian Republic.\n\nHistory\nUntil the 16th century, the Low Countries—corresponding roughly to the present-day Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg—consisted of a number of duchies, counties, and prince-bishoprics, almost all of which were under the supremacy of the Holy Roman Empire, with the exception of the County of Flanders, most of which was under the Kingdom of France.\nMost of the Low Countries had come under the rule of the House of Burgundy and subsequently the House of Habsburg. In 1549, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V issued the Pragmatic Sanction, which further unified the Seventeen Provinces under his rule. Charles was succeeded by his son, King Philip II of Spain. In 1568, the Netherlands, led by William I of Orange, together with Philip de Montmorency, Count of Hoorn, and Lamoral, Count of Egmont revolted against Philip II because of high taxes, persecution of Protestants by the government, and Philip's efforts to modernize and centralize the devolved-medieval government structures of the provinces. This was the start of the Eighty Years' War. During the initial phase of the war, the revolt was largely unsuccessful. Spain regained control over most of the rebelling provinces. This period is known as the \"Spanish Fury\" due to the high number of massacres, instances of mass looting, and total destruction of multiple cities and in particular Antwerp between 1572 and 1579.\nIn 1579, a number of the northern provinces of the Low Countries signed the Union of Utrecht, in which they promised to support each other in their defence against the Army of Flanders. This was followed in 1581 by the Act of Abjuration, the declaration of independence of the provinces from Philip II. Dutch colonialism began at this point, as the Netherlands was able to swipe a number of Portuguese and Spanish colonies, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. After the assassination of William of Orange on 10 July 1584, both Henry III of France and Elizabeth I of England declined offers of sovereignty. However, the latter agreed to turn the United Provinces into a protectorate of England (Treaty of Nonsuch, 1585), and sent the Earl of Leicester as governor-general. This was unsuccessful and in 1588 the provinces became a confederacy. The Union of Utrecht is regarded as the foundation of the Republic of the Seven United Provinces, which was not recognized by Spain until the Peace of Westphalia in 1648.\nDuring the Anglo-French War (1778–1783), the internal territory was divided into two groups: the Patriots, who were pro-French and pro-American, and the Orangists, who were pro-British. The Republic of the United Provinces faced a series of republican revolutions in 1783–1787. During this period, republican forces occupied several major Dutch cities. Initially on the defence, the Orangist forces received aid from Prussian troops and retook the Netherlands in 1787. The republican forces fled to France, but then successfully re-invaded alongside the army of the French Republic (1793–1795), ousting stadtholder William V, abolishing the Dutch Republic, and replacing it with the Batavian Republic (1795–1806). After the French Republic became the French Empire under Napoleon, the Batavian Republic was replaced by the Napoleonic Kingdom of Holland (1806–1810).\nThe Netherlands regained independence from France in 1813. In the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 the names \"United Provinces of the Netherlands\" and \"United Netherlands\" were used. In 1815, it was rejoined with the Austrian Netherlands and Liège (the \"Southern provinces\") to become the Kingdom of the Netherlands, informally known as the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, to create a strong buffer state north of France. On 16 March 1815, the son of stadtholder William V crowned himself King William I of the Netherlands. Between 1815 and 1890, the King of the Netherlands was also in a personal union the Grand Duke of the sovereign Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. After Belgium gained its independence in 1830, the state became unequivocally known as the \"Kingdom of the Netherlands\", as it remains today.\n\nEconomy\nDuring the Dutch Golden Age in the late-16th and 17th centuries, the Dutch Republic dominated world trade, conquering a vast colonial empire and operating the largest fleet of merchantmen of any nation. The County of Holland was the wealthiest and most urbanized region in the world. In 1650 the urban population of the Dutch Republic as a percentage of total population was 31.7 percent, while that of the Spanish Netherlands was 20.8 percent, of Portugal 16.6 percent, and of Italy 14 percent. In 1675 the urban population density of Holland alone was 61 percent, compared to the rest of the Dutch Republic, where 27 percent lived in urban areas.The free trade spirit of the time was augmented by the development of a modern, effective stock market in the Low Countries. The Netherlands has the oldest stock exchange in the world, founded in 1602 by the Dutch East India Company, while Rotterdam has the oldest bourse in the Netherlands. The Dutch East-India Company exchange went public in six different cities. Later, a court ruled that the company had to reside legally in a single city, so Amsterdam is recognized as the oldest such institution based on modern trading principles. While the banking system evolved in the Low Countries, it was quickly incorporated by the well-connected English, stimulating English economic output.The Dutch Republic was a master of banking, often compared to 14th century Florence. When Southern Europe was experiencing poor harvests, surplus grain from Poland was sold by the Dutch for large profits.\n\nPolitics\nThe republic was a confederation of seven provinces, which had their own governments and were very independent, and a number of so-called Generality Lands. The latter were governed directly by the States General, the federal government. The States General were seated in The Hague and consisted of representatives of each of the seven provinces. The provinces of the republic were, in official feudal order:\n\nDuchy of Guelders\nCounty of Holland\nCounty of Zeeland\nLordship of Utrecht\nLordship of Overijssel\nLordship of Frisia\nLordship of GroningenThere was an eighth province, the County of Drenthe, but this area was so poor that it was exempt from paying federal taxes, and as a consequence, it was denied representation in the States General.\nEach province was governed by the Provincial States, their main executive official (though not the official head of state) being a raadpensionaris or landsadvocaat. In times of war, the stadtholder, who commanded the army, would have more power than the raadpensionaris. In theory, the stadtholders were freely appointed by and subordinate to the states of each province. However, in practice the princes of Orange of the House of Orange-Nassau, beginning with William the Silent, were always chosen as stadtholders of most of the provinces.\nZeeland and usually Utrecht had the same stadtholder as Holland. There was a constant power struggle between the Orangists, who supported the stadtholders and specifically the princes of Orange, and the Republicans, who supported the States General and hoped to replace the semi-hereditary nature of the stadtholdership with a true republican structure.\nAfter the Peace of Westphalia, several border territories were assigned to the United Provinces. They were federally governed Generality Lands. These were Staats-Brabant, Staats-Vlaanderen, Staats-Overmaas, and (after the Treaty of Utrecht) Staats-Opper-Gelre. The States General of the United Provinces were in control of the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company, but some shipping expeditions were initiated by some of the provinces, mostly Holland and Zeeland.\nThe framers of the United States Constitution were influenced by the Constitution of the Republic of the United Provinces, as Federalist No. 20, by James Madison, shows. Such influence appears, however, to have been of a negative nature, as Madison describes the Dutch confederacy as exhibiting \"Imbecility in the government; discord among the provinces; foreign influence and indignities; a precarious existence in peace, and peculiar calamities from war.\" Apart from this, the American Declaration of Independence is similar to the Act of Abjuration, essentially the declaration of independence of the United Provinces, but concrete evidence that the latter directly influenced the former is absent.\n\nReligion\nIn the Union of Utrecht of 20 January 1579, Holland and Zeeland were granted the right to accept only one religion (in practice, Calvinism). Every other province had the freedom to regulate the religious question as it wished, although the Union stated every person should be free in the choice of personal religion and that no person should be prosecuted based on religious choice. William of Orange had been a strong supporter of public and personal freedom of religion and hoped to unite Protestants and Catholics in the new union, and, for him, the Union was a defeat. In practice, Catholic services in all provinces were quickly forbidden, and the Dutch Reformed Church became the \"public\" or \"privileged\" church in the republic.During the republic, any person who wished to hold public office had to conform to the Reformed Church and take an oath to this effect. The extent to which different religions or denominations were persecuted depended much on the time period and regional or city leaders. In the beginning, this was especially focused on Roman Catholics, being the religion of the enemy. In 17th-century Leiden, for instance, people opening their homes to services could be fined 200 guilders (a year's wage for a skilled tradesman) and banned from the city. Throughout this, however, personal freedom of religion existed and was one factor—along with economic reasons—in causing large immigration of religious refugees from other parts of Europe.In the first years of the republic, controversy arose within the Reformed Church, mainly around the subject of predestination. This has become known as the struggle between Arminianism and Gomarism, or between Remonstrants and Contra-Remonstrants. In 1618, the Synod of Dort tackled this issue, which led to the banning of the Remonstrant faith.\nBeginning in the 18th century, the situation changed from more or less active persecution of religious services to a state of restricted toleration of other religions, as long as their services took place secretly in private churches.\n\nDecline\nLong-term rivalry between the two main factions in Dutch society, the Staatsgezinden (Republicans, Dutch States Party) and the Prinsgezinden (Royalists or Orangists), sapped the strength and unity of the country. Johan de Witt and the Republicans did reign supreme for a time at the middle of the 17th century (the First Stadtholderless Period) until his overthrow and murder in 1672. Subsequently, William III of Orange became stadtholder. After a 22-year stadtholderless era, the Orangists regained power, and his first problem was to survive the Franco-Dutch War (with the derivative Third Anglo-Dutch war), when France, England, Münster, and Cologne united against this country.\nWars to contain the expansionist policies of France in various coalitions after the Glorious Revolution, mostly including England and Scotland—after 1707, Great Britain—burdened the republic with huge debts, although little of the fighting after 1673 took place on its own territory. The necessity to maintain a vast army against France meant that less money could be spent on the navy, weakening the republic's economy. After William III's death in 1702 the Second Stadtholderless Period was inaugurated. Despite having contributed much in the War of the Spanish Succession, the Dutch Republic gained little from the peace talks in Utrecht (1713). However, the Dutch had over a period of forty years successfully defended their positions in the Southern Netherlands and their troops were central in the alliances which had halted French territorial expansion in Europe until 1792. The end of the War of the Austrian Succession in 1748, and Austria becoming allies with France against Prussia, marked the end of the republic as a major military power.Fierce competition for trade and colonies, especially from France and England, furthered the economic downturn of the country. The three Anglo-Dutch Wars and the rise of mercantilism had a negative effect on Dutch shipping and commerce.\n\nSee also\nList of countries that gained independence from Spain\nDutch Empire\nDutch East India Company\nPassage 3:\nSumardi\nSumardi (born 26 June 1972) is an Indonesian former footballer who plays as a goalkeeper.\nPassage 4:\nZeferino Martins\nZeferino Martins, also known as Ze Martins (born September 5, 1985) is an East Timorese footballer who plays as midfielder for Ad.

The commission was officially created to investigate acts of violence that occurred around the independence referendum held in East Timor in 1999 and sought to find the \"conclusive truth\" behind the events. After holding private hearings and document reviews, the commission handed in the final report on July 15, 2008 to the presidents of both nations, and was fully endorsed by Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, providing the first acknowledgement by the government of Indonesia of the human rights violations committed by state institutions in Timor. The commission is notable for being the first modern truth commission to be bilateral.\n\nBackground\nEast Timor was originally colonized by the Portuguese, and remained a colony up until the fall of the military dictatorship in 1974. East Timor declared independence soon afterwards, but Indonesia soon decided to intervene as it became clear that the government of the new state would most likely be leftist. The Indonesian government began Operation Komodo, which was intended to bring about the integration of the East Timorese territory. It began with a propaganda campaign, but after the outbreak of conflict in East Timor, the Indonesian military began a campaign on 7 October starting with an assault on a border post and accumulating with a full-scale invasion utilizing paratroopers and naval support. The United Nations quickly condemned the invasion via resolution, but due to resistance in the Security council, no further action was taken. The United States also tacitly gave their approval, as the dismantling of a pro-communist government helped advance the policy of containment being pursued by the government.\nIndonesia occupied the territory for the following two decades. During the administration of the Habibie government, a referendum was held in the occupied area asking if the residents of the area wished to remain a part of Indonesia. Even before the referendum, there was harassment by militia groups in the area, with UN workers being attacked in Maliana. It soon became clear in the wake of the referendum that the referendum result would be overwhelmingly in favor of the \"no\" option on the ballot; this raised tensions to a boiling point, and within two hours of the announcement of the results, armed militia groups began attacking civilians. Militia continued to attack civilians as they withdrew from the country, and several massacres occurred as the troops filtered out of the area. A UN peacekeeping force known as INTERFET was deployed to stabilize the situation, made up of mostly Australian troops, and was withdrawn with the arrival of normal UN peacekeepers. East Timor eventually transitioned from a UN mandate to an independent country.\n\nReport\nThe commission itself was announced in August 2006 and sought to establish \"the conclusive truth regarding human rights violations to have occurred prior to, immediately after the Popular Consultation on 30 August 1999\" as well as \"prepare recommendations that can contribute to healing wounds of the past and strengthen friendship\". The timing of the commission's creation was criticized by some, as it was believed that it was created to intentionally subvert calls for an international tribunal to deal with the events surrounding the 1999 plebiscite. The commission's mandate allowed it to review documents pertaining to four other inquiries surrounding the events that predated it: \"The Indonesian National Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights Violations in East Timor in 1999\", \"The Indonesian Ad Hoc Human Rights Court on East Timor\", \"The Special Panels for Serious Crimes\", and \"The Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation\".The commission was made up of four members appointed from each nation, and these commissioners were instructed to conduct a document review and analyze previous trials and investigations into the subject, including the UN Special Panels for Serious Crimes and Serious Crime Units in Dili, and the report of the Commission of Reception, Truth and Reconciliation of Timor-Leste. The commission also stated its intent to research the \"historical background, political dynamics, and institutional structures that shaped events before and during 1999\" to \"inform its conclusions with a broader understanding of the way in which the causes of the violence in 1999 were connected to previously established institutional structures and practices.\"Operating over three years, the commission gave its final report on July 15, 2008, and presented it to the Presidents of Indonesia and East Timor, concluding that \"gross human rights violations in the form of crimes against humanity did occur in East Timor in 1999\" and that \"pro-autonomy militia groups, TNI, the Indonesian civil government, and Polri must all bear institutional responsibility\", as well as stating that \"from a moral and political perspective the respective states must accept state responsibility for the violations identified in the report.\" The commission also made recommendations that both nations begin institutional reform enhancing the strength of investigative and prosecuting bodies involved with investigations into the events, as well as forming joint security policy to ensure the safety of individuals in case of the recurrence of violence. It also noted the need to resolve other standing border and security issues between the two nations to allow for more cooperation. Notably, the report gave no recommendations of amnesty or rehabilitation. The report was endorsed by the president of Indonesia, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, making it the first recognition of the Indonesian government's complicity in human rights violations in East Timor by Indonesia.\n\nReception\nIn Indonesia and Timor, the report was presented to both governments and accepted by both the Timorese and Indonesian governments. However, Timorese NGO Timor-Leste National Alliance for International Tribunal wrote an open letter in response to the commission's findings with several criticisms, including the lack of public consultation with victims and parliamentary approval of the commission, as well as noting that the commission assigned institutional responsibility rather than individual responsibility, \"which is contrary to the principles of international laws which were ratified by the state of Timor-Leste and to Article 160 of its constitution which says that there must be a justice process for crimes against humanity.\", as well as stating their belief that the CAVR was a more trustworthy and support worthy commission for the government to support.Internationally, the report had a mixed reception. Some, such as the War Crimes Studies Center at the University of California, Berkeley, said that the commission could be seen as \"widely acknowledged as credible and far-reaching.\", noting that the Indonesian government's affirmation of the results was important and that the commission made arguments that \"there was credible evidence to indicate that Timorese institutions were also responsible for illegal detentions and possibly other crimes.\"\n\nSee also\nHistory of East Timor\nCommission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor\nIndonesian occupation of East Timor\nSanta Cruz massacre\n\nAnswer the question based on the given passages.

Bodhi makes plans to create fake bomb blasts in the puja campus and create a mess. According to his plans a terrible mess occurs at the pandal, several people are stampeded. Bodhi even pays the media to cover this incident exclusively and promote it more seriously than the actual incident, eventually the police authorities ban the puja and order for the dismantle of the idol after puja. Kigan is put into jail for quarrelling with police. Later Bodhi releases Kigan from jail and on way to home he explains Kigan that he took his revenge by getting the puja banned from public. Kigan requests Bodhi to open the puja after 2–3 days but Bodhi disagrees. Kigan then challenges Bodhi that he would reopen the puja till immersion. Meanwhile, Kigan owns up to his mistakes to Aditi and they get reunited again. Next day Kigan investigates that only two persons were injured not many and it was a paid fake news. Kigan has meetings with police commissioner, governor regarding reopening of the puja but everywhere he gets negative response. Out of utter depression Kigan goes to Bodhi's house, determined that Bodhi is responsible for all this and he would kill Bodhi. Kigan and Bodhi have a fight where Kigan is about to kill Bodhi but then Bodhi's son attacks Kigan with a bat and Kigan falls. Bodhi scolds his son for hitting an elder person but Kigan supports him. Then Bodhi tells that he doesn't want to make his son like Kigan, so he will teach him proper manners. Here Bodhi discloses that his son is not his but actually Kigan's and he has tendered him as his own child and always has been a good father because he wants to make him a gentleman and an not as irresponsible as Kigan. Bodhi also discloses that Aditi has always been loving Kigan though Bodhi has always been a good husband. Even though he has brought up Kigan's child as his own child, Aditi has never developed any feeling towards him so he decided to finish Kigan who has destroyed his own family for that he has also destroyed his masterpiece creation. Bodhi repents that he is the Asur (villain) and begs pardon from Kigan. Bodhi also discloses that he is not the only one associated with this planning but Aditi is also responsible for this. Aditi thought of taking revenge from Kigan after her father's incident so she had been involved in this case.\n\nParagraph 2: Bryan Durham of The Times of India gave the album 4 out of 5 and summarized, \"In totality, it also needs to be said that if Rahman's music is the language of this film, it would be quite short on a vocabulary without Irshad Kamil's beautiful lyrics.\" Jyoti Prakash of Indian Box Office Online also gave it 4.5 out of 5 stars and said, \"The music of Raanjhanaa is of supreme quality. A typical AR Rahman album which is romantic and entertaining yet pure and divine.\" Music Aloud critic Vipin assigned the soundtrack 8 out of 10 and noted, \"A mixed bag from ARR that is more urbane than folk-classical.\" Kaushik Ramesh of Planet Bollywood gave the album 7/10. Calling it very experimental, he said, \"Be it the innovative vocal shehnai of 'Ay Sakhi' or Rabbi's attitude laden 'Tu Mun Shudi', the entire album presents immense freshness.\" Rumnique Nannar of Bollyspice gave the album 4.5/5 stars and wrote, \"Raanjhanaa is a brilliant return to form and originality for A. R. Rahman, who proves his detractors wrong with an album that captures the energy of its city and its lovestruck Raanjhana. The songs may just take time to grow on the listener, but that's the joy in it, to savour all of the arrangements and voices that add up to a terrific and rustic album for the ages.\" Sakhayan Ghosh of The Indian Express summarized, \"Irshad Kamil's lyrics provide a perfect foil to the music. And this is Rahman's finest turn since Rockstar, seeing the maestro enter exciting new musical territories.\" He gave the album 4 out of 5. Joginder Tuteja at Movie Talkies claimed, \"There were good expectations from the music of Raanjhanaa and they are pretty much met (and at places even exceeded) with A. R. Rahman, Irshad Kamil and their singers coming together well to meet the shared vision that was spearheaded by the makers.\" He gave the album 3.5 out of 5 and added that the music \"works quite well as a packaged affair\". IANS gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars and observed, \"Like any other album, the music of Raanjhanaa has few low points, but otherwise it is thoroughly entertaining.\" At Koimoi, critic Manohar Basu rated the album 3 on 5 and noted, \"Very unlikely to be a Rahman composition, the music yet again lacks a soul stirring capability which made him a maverick once! Technically it is both brilliant and fine but the midas touch of the musician is strikingly missing.\" The critics review board at Behindwoods called it a \"joyous wonder from Rahman\" and gave it 3.5 out of 5.\n\nParagraph 3: October 28 – Led by Steve Pearce and David Price, the Boston Red Sox ended the World Series in five games with a 5–1 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium. Winners of a franchise-record 108 games during the season, the Red Sox buried the AL East Division across six months and claimed 11 more victories in the playoffs, knocking off the 100-win New York Yankees in the ALDS, the defending World Series champion Houston Astros in the ALCS,  and the two-time NL champion Dodgers in the Fall Classic, while losing just one game in each round. Pearce hit a two-run home run off Clayton Kershaw in the top of the first inning, and the Red Sox took a lead they would never give back. Solo homers by Mookie Betts in the sixth inning and J. D. Martinez in the seventh quieted the Dodger Stadium crowd, while Pearce struck again with a solo shot off Pedro Báez to make it 5–1 in the eighth. Those homers came just a day after Pearce crushed a tying home run in the eighth inning of Game 4, followed by a three-run double that broke the game open in the ninth. Price limited the Dodgers to a solo homer by David Freese on his first pitch and otherwise shut them down over seven-plus innings, allowing just two more hits, striking out five and walking two, while retiring 14 in a row before giving a leadoff walk in the eighth inning. Price was followed by Joe Kelly, who struck out three straight pinch hitters, and Chris Sale, who was originally scheduled to start an eventual Game 5. But Sale finished off the Dodgers in style, striking out the side in the ninth and Manny Machado swinging to end it. Pierce earned World Series MVP honors by collecting four hits— three homers and a double in 12 at bats – along with eight RBI and five runs scored. Boston manager Alex Cora became the first Puerto Rican to lead a team to the World Series, as well as the second Latino manager to do it in the Series. The Venezuelan Ozzie Guillén became the first when he led the Chicago White Sox to the title in 2005. With their victory in the World Series, the Red Sox secured their ninth championship title, tying the Philadelphia/Oakland Athletics franchise for the third most in MLB history behind the New York Yankees (27) and St. Louis Cardinals (11). But the Red Sox have come on strong in recent years, winning four titles in a span of 15 seasons from 2004 through 2018. As a result, they are the first MLB club to win four World Series titles in the 21st century. \n\nParagraph 4: The 1915 Panama-California Exposition in Balboa Park spurred the next phase of transportation growth. A new electric car line was constructed up 12th Street to the park's entrance with 101 new cars from the St. Louis Car Company, and the Adams Avenue operating division was established in Normal Heights. San Diego's original Victorian style train depot was demolished and replaced with a new Mission Revival Style Santa Fe depot building. The SDERy logged 3,521,571 car miles. The \"Great Flood\" in 1916 caused significant damage, washing out several rail lines. World War I increased the cost of railway construction materials by 50 to 150 percent. There was a significant increase in the private ownership of automobiles, and the SDERy began to lose revenue to private \"Jitney Buses\". On November 15, 1919, the \"golden spike\" was driven and construction of the SD&A was ceremonially completed at a cost of $18 million (three times the original estimate). Spreckels announced plans in 1920 to discontinue service on several rail lines to offset expenses, leading to approval of \"zone fares\". The SDERy purchased new streetcars that requires only one driver/conductor instead of two; older cars were retrofitted to reduce labor costs. Spreckels sold his power generating plants to the Consolidated Gas and Electric Company.\n\nParagraph 5: Vasily Bartold argues that by the 19th century those described as \"Sarts\" had become much more Turkicised than had previously been the case. In the literature of Imperial Russia in the 19th century the term was sometimes used to denote the Turkic-speaking peoples of Ferghana, Tashkent, Chimkent and the Southern Syr Darya Province, (also found in smaller numbers in Samarkand and Bukhara). \"Sart\" was also commonly employed by the Russians as a general term for all the settled natives of Turkestan. There was a great deal of debate over what this actually meant, and where the name came from. Barthold writes that \"To the kazakh every member of a settled community was a Sart whether his language was Turkic or Iranian\". Nikolai Ostroumov was firm in his conviction that it was not an ethnic definition but an occupational one, and he backed this up by quoting some (apparently common) local sayings: \"A bad Kyrgyz becomes a Sart, whilst a bad Sart becomes a Kyrgyz\". This confusion reached its peak in the 1897 Russian Empire Census: the Ferghana Province was held to have a very large Sart population, the neighbouring Samarkand Province very few but a great many Uzbeks. The distinction between the two was often far from clear. Although historically speaking the Sarts belonged to older settled groups, whereas the Uzbeks were descended from tribes which arrived in the region with Shaibani Khan in the 16th century. It seems that, in Khorezm at least, Uzbeks spoke a now-extinct Kipchak dialect closer to Kazakh, while Sarts spoke a form of Persianised Oghuz Turkic. In Fergana, the Sarts spoke a Karluk dialect that was very close to modern Uyghur and is believed to be the earlier, historical form of modern Uzbek. In 1924 the Soviet regime decreed that henceforth all settled Turkic-speaking peoples in Central Asia (and many others who spoke Persian such as in Samarkand and Bukhara areas) would be known as \"Uzbeks\", and that the term \"Sart\" was to be abolished as an insulting legacy of colonial rule., despite the fact that Lenin himself used the term in his communiques.  For the first few years, however, the language chosen by the Soviet authorities for the new Uzbek SSR was not the modern Uzbek that is found today, but the nomadic, less Persianized and quite exotic dialect of the city of Turkistan in modern Kazakhstan.\"The Uighurs are the people whom old Russian travellers called Sart (a name which they used for sedentary, Turkic-speaking Central Asians in general), while Western travellers called them Turki, in recognition of their language. The Chinese used to call them Ch'an-t'ou ('Turbaned Heads') but this term has been dropped, being considered derogatory, and the Chinese, using their own pronunciation, now called them Weiwuerh. As a matter of fact there was for centuries no 'national' name for them; people identified themselves with the oasis they came from, like Kashgar or Turfan.\" This dialect proved itself to be largely incomprehensible to most inhabitants of the primary cities, from Tashkent to Bukhara. It was therefore replaced by the modern, fundamentally Persianized \"urban Uzbek\" which is consequently the only Turkic language in the world without any vowel harmony.\n\nParagraph 6: The original vision for Shingwauk Hall in the early 19th century came from  Chief Shingwauk, the chief of the Garden River Ojibway people, as he felt \"that the future Ojibway needed to learn the white man's academic method of education in order to survive in what was becoming a 'predominately non-native world with non-native values'\". While Chief Shingwauk's vision of a teaching wigwam for his people would not come to fruition in his lifetime, a residential school would eventually receive funding in 1872 from the combined efforts of Chiefs Augustin Shingwauk and Buhkwujjenene Shingwauk (Chief Shingwauk's sons) and the Anglican Missionary, Rev. Edward Francis Wilson.\n\nParagraph 7: Vasily Bartold argues that by the 19th century those described as \"Sarts\" had become much more Turkicised than had previously been the case.

An Act of March 1977 makes provision, for a limited period, for benefits to be paid from the age of 64 to workers who agree to retire in order to free jobs for young unemployed people, in response to the rise of youth unemployment. A number of other improvements were introduced in 1977, with Attendance Allowances extended to cover disabled foster children and non-contributory disablement pensions extended to married women whose invalidity prevented them from carrying out their household tasks. In January 1977, regulations were issued which brought about a change in the administration of legislation governing fire precautions at places of work. Under these regulations the Health and Safety Executive retained full responsibility for fire safety in certain 'special' premises such as nuclear installations, coalmines and chemical plants, whereas responsibility for general fire precautions at places of work was transferred to local fire authorities. A number of new services and benefits for disabled people were also introduced. A Non-Contributory Invalidity Pension in lieu of ‘pocket money’ allowance for long-stay patients in mental hospitals was introduced. The therapeutic earnings limit for recipients of Invalidity Pension, Non-Contributory Invalidity Pension and Unemployability Supplement was raised while the Private Car Maintenance Allowance for War Pensioners was increased. From the 29th of August 1977, Attendance Allowance became payable to foster parents of disabled children, and was also extended to kidney patients dialysing at home. Industrial injury provisions for occupational deafness were introduced, and viral hepatitis and Vinyl Chloride Monomer induced diseases were prescribed as industrial diseases. Easing of conditions for entitlement to industrial death benefit in certain cases of death from pulmonary disease was carried out. £12.1 million was paid to the Rowntree Trust Family Fund for disabled children, while the terms of reference of the Rowntree Trust Family Fund were extended to include all severely disabled children. Limited right of appeal on diagnosis of pneumoconiosis was also introduced. A phasing in of a new behind-the-ear hearing aid for up 1 million hearing impaired people was carried out. Special hearing aids for children and young people were introduced. Audiology services were developed, Hearing Therapists were introduced, and the Blind Person’s tax allowance was increased. Improvements were made to the wheel-chair service, while further parking concessions were made for all ‘Orange Badge’ holders. In addition, the ‘Orange Badge’ scheme was extended to include the blind, and concessions to ‘Orange Badge’ holders at most tolled crossings were introduced. The petrol allowance was also restored and doubled for drivers of government-supplied invalid vehicles. Another measure was the extension of exemption from Road Tax (vehicle excise duty) to Mobility Allowance beneficiaries or their nominees. Concessionary fares for disabled people were introduced, along with a discretionary allowance of up to £160 to disabled students whose disability led to additional expenses in connection with their studies. Improved provision for the needs of disabled people in educational establishments was carried out, and a scheme of grants was made to employers “towards the cost of adaptations to premises or equipment made to enable disabled individuals to obtain, or retain, employment.” The 4th of July 1977 saw the inception of an experimental Job Introduction Scheme “to provide financial assistance enabling certain disabled people to undertake a trial period of employment with an employer, where there is reasonable doubt as to the person’s ability to perform a particular job.” On the 5th of July 1978 a revised and simplified scheme designed to help severely disabled people with their travel-to-work costs was introduced. Increased allowances were paid to people going on employment rehabilitation courses, while under the MSC Special Programme for young people additional opportunities were provided at Employment Rehabilitation Centres for disabled young people. A Release for Training (RFT) scheme was introduced for disabled people already in employment “but experiencing problems which can only be resolved by a period of intensive training.”  District Handicap Teams were set up, the War Pensioners’ visiting scheme was extended, and zero rating of VAT was introduced “on aids and appliances for disabled people and also on medical equipment for donation to a hospital for the purpose of treatment or research.” New arrangements were introduced for dental treatment of disabled patients, and special concessionary TV license arrangements were extended for people in old people’s homes.\n\nParagraph 10: The cuisine of the Tagalog people varies by province. Bulacan is popular for Chicharrón (pork rinds) and steamed rice and tuber cakes like puto. It is a center for panghimagas or desserts, like brown rice cake or kutsinta, sapin-sapin, suman, cassava cake, ube halaya and the king of sweets, in San Miguel, Bulacan, the famous carabao milk candy pastillas de leche, with its pabalat wrapper. Cainta, in Rizal province east of Manila, is known for its Filipino rice cakes and puddings. These are usually topped with latik, a mixture of coconut milk and brown sugar, reduced to a dry crumbly texture. A more modern, and time saving alternative to latik are coconut flakes toasted in a frying pan. Antipolo, straddled mid-level in the mountainous regions of the Philippine Sierra Madre, is a town known for its suman and cashew products. Laguna is known for buko pie (coconut pie) and panutsa (peanut brittle). Batangas is home to Taal Lake, a body of water that surrounds Taal Volcano. The lake is home to 75 species of freshwater fish, including landlocked marine species that have since adapted to the Taal lake environment. Eight of these species are of high commercial value. These include a population of giant trevally locally known as maliputo which is distinguished from their marine counterparts which are known as talakitok. Another commercially important species is the tawilis, the only known freshwater sardine and endemic to the lake. Batangas is also known for its special coffee, kapeng barako. Quezon, especially the town of Lucban, is also known for its culinary dishes, with Lucban longganisa, pancit habhab, and hardinera being the most notable. The influence of coconut milk dishes, such as laing (called tinuto in some places in Quezon) and sinantol, is also felt in the province because of its proximity to Bicol. Suman is also a notable food in the province, especially in the town of Infanta and the city of Tayabas, though having the same ingredients as the one in Antipolo, the things that makes Infanta and Tayabas suman unique is its packaging and size; Infanta's suman is smaller in size and is usually grouped into 20 per pack, while Tayabas' suman is also unique in packaging, with a long tail that makes it look like a lit candle, in connection to its tradition of throwing suman during the feast of the city's patron, Isidore the Laborer.\n\nParagraph 11: The precise borders of traditional Gooreng Gooreng lands have been disputed. Walter Roth, while collecting data on their language in the later 19th century, placed them in Camboon Rawbelle where their main camp was at that time, Jiggings\". Norman Tindale distinguished them from a Goeng Meerooni Coastal people (1770/Agnes) and defined their land as extending over  and embracing the eastern bank of the upper Burnett River from Mundubbera north to Callide Ranges Queensland and East to Mt Perry Ranges and  Many Peaks. It is possible that a confusion arose, taking two distinct dialect forms of the one cultural complex, to denote distinct and separate realities, with the Gureng Gureng taken to be an inland tribe, and the Goeng (Meerooni) denoting their affines on the coast. A recent survey of the available evidence concludes that the Goreng goring's lands encompassed the \"whole of Boyne Valley to Auburn NoGo Callide Cania Ranges No Coastal Reef Dialect Language exists as Kooreng Gooreng Gooreng Gooreng are inland Freshwater People\n\nParagraph 12: Returning crews reported a successful attack  and Guy Gibson's official report next day, and his subsequent account of 'one of the greatest low-level daylight raids of the war', were celebratory, as wartime morale required, but one of Gibson's flight commanders, Squadron Leader John Searby, later wrote that 'Le Creusot was a profound disappointment and he said as much on his return.' Post-strike photographs took some time to obtain. For several days the weather was unsuitable. Then, on 21 October, the photo-reconnaissance Spitfire was shot down over the target. The pilot, Flight Lieutenant Tony Hill, famed in intelligence circles for his low-level pictures of German radar installations, was pulled alive from the wreckage, but soon died of his injuries. Eventually another Spitfire made a successful run. The pictures showed that Searby's misgivings were justified and that much of the bombing had fallen short on to the workers' housing. Even so, there was considerable damage to the general machine shops and locomotive machine shops, the steel sheet and bar mills and a 650ft warehouse which was completely destroyed. Production at the Schneider Works was halted for three weeks, and repairs continued on the plant for eight months. The raid had been well executed in most respects. The navigation by Wing Commander Slee's navigator, Pilot Officer A S Grant, was perfect. However bombing accuracy had been poor. Bomber Command's Operational Research Section 'thought this was partly attributable to the failing light and the smoke which soon began to drift across the target, but they also thought that the tactics adopted had been inappropriate and that the bomb sights had not been properly used. They suggested that the outcome was the penalty of employing night crews in complex daylight operations without giving them more than a few days' training.' Crews had been ordered to climb and accelerate immediately before target, which made it impossible to set the Mark IX Course Setting Bomb Sight correctly, since this sight required a long, straight and level run-up to target in order to calculate the drift and could not adjust for the aircraft's attitude. Even at fairly low height, the bombs had to be released more than a mile short of target, to allow for forward travel on the drop, and the calculations were complex. The much more advanced, computerised and gyro-stabilised Mark XIV bomb sight, with automatic input from the aircraft's flight instruments, only entered squadron service some months later. Additionally, the bombers were under-armed, carrying less than 4,000lb each, as the Lancaster's exceptional load-carrying ability was still not fully recognised. The following month, the Lancaster's official all-up (maximum take-off) weight was increased from 60,000lb to 63,000lb, and after mid-1943, when the limit was raised to 65,000lb, Lancasters would seldom carry less than an 8,000lb bomb load, even when fully fuelled to 2,154 gallons for maximum range. After the eight months of repair works on the Schneider plant at Le Creusot had been completed, on 19/20 June 1943 Bomber Command struck again, this time in greater strength and at night: 290 bombers, mostly Halifaxes and Stirlings, attacked, about 20 per cent of the bombloads hitting the Schneider plant. Residential areas suffered heavy damage. The following night, Leonard Slee, by now a group captain, would lead Operation Bellicose, an attack by 5 and 8 Groups on a German radar factory at Friedrichshafen, with considerable success.\n\nParagraph 13: Accounts of the success of the opera vary greatly.  The Mercure Galant states that the opera was extremely well received; that audiences were enthralled by Lully's music as always and that they would never have guessed that Corneille had composed the libretto in so little time as three weeks.  On the other hand, the Frères Parfraict in their Histoire de l'académie royale de musique claim that the opera is \"irremediably cold\" and that \"the diabolical character of Venus ruins what little galantry there is to be found\" in it.  These reports are both equally difficult to believe when one considers, on the one hand, that Thomas Corneille was one of the chief editors of the Mercure Galant and, on the other hand, in what contempt the Parfaict brothers held all authors of the 17th century other than Pierre Corneille, Molière, Jean Racine and, for opera, Philippe Quinault.  Might they have felt obligated to condemn Thomas Corneille's libretto out of fidelity to his brother, Molière and most of all Quinault whose place Thomas Corneille may have thought he was usurping indefinitely?  The Parfaict brothers' attitude seems to have remained the dominant one since the 18th century. Robert Fajon, in his Opéra à Paris du Roi Soleil à Louis le Bien-Aimé, even goes so far as to accuse Thomas Corneille of being responsible for Lully's only operatic failure.  Concretely, however, none of Lully's operas were a failure.  Their success continued to daunt operatic composers well into the 18th century.  It is true that Psyché, unlike many of Lully's operas, was not created at court and was only revived twice (once in 1703 and again in 1713).  Thésée, by comparison was revived ten times and remained in the repertoire of the Académie royale de musique until 1744.\n\nParagraph 14: In 2007–2008, the story of an andong pocong surfaced in Sidoarjo, East Java, where the ghost was depicted as a lone pocong riding a carriage drawn by a ghostly horse. The arrival of the andong pocong is heralded with a sound of eerie bells. The ghost would knock on the doors of people's homes during the darkest hours of the night, and those who answer to the door would be afflicted by a mysterious illness before dying a few days later. The andong pocong story originated from the story of a newly-wed groom who was killed in a freak accident involving a horse carriage, but some people also linked the andong pocong to the usage of black magic.Pocong Merah or red shroud ghost is arguably the most feared pocong variant due to its violent and dangerous nature, despite of its rarity. It is said to be born out of a person who wished to seek revenge for an unpleasant death, making it more akin to a vengeful spirit often found in many folklores in the West. The red color of this pocong's shroud is associated with the feeling of bitterness, anger, and vengeance felt by the person during the final moments of life. Of all variants of pocongs, the red pocong is believed to be more likely to attack the living on sight and without provocation. Because of this, many believe the red pocongs are kings, or leaders of some sort, of a colony of pocongs.In the rural parts of Yogyakarta, there is a river known as Code River which is said to be inhabited by a massive colony of pocongs numbering in the thousands. The colony itself is led by a very peculiar red pocong, who lived as an early 20th century local shaman specializing in black magic. According to the story, the shaman's shady lifestyle and practices greatly disturbed the villagers living in the same village. So much so that one day they decided that they would not tolerate him any longer, and so they hunted him down, murdered him in cold blood, and mutilated his body. The body parts were latter wrapped in large white shroud, which later turned red because of the blood from the shaman's body, and buried somewhere in a pine forest near the riverbank. In death, the shaman swore revenge on the villagers who had slaughtered him in cold blood, and so his vengeful spirit, alongside thousands of pocongs he has 'recruited' over the years, has been haunting the Code River to this very day.\n\nParagraph 15: Shawna Malcom of the Los Angeles Times reviewed the episode \"Vitamin D\" positively, praising the focus it gave Artie: \"Until now, the wheelchair-bound character has served mostly as a punchline. Last night, he got a much-deserved moment in the spotlight, and he rolled with it, doing his best Richie Sambora on the talk box, then taking lead vocals on the Usher track.\" The episode \"Wheels\", which placed focus on Artie and his disability, drew criticism from a committee of performers with disabilities, who felt that casting a non-disabled actor to play a disabled student was inappropriate. CSI star Robert David Hall commented, \"I think there's a fear of litigation, that a person with disabilities might slow a production down, fear that viewers might be uncomfortable.\" Glee creator Brad Falchuk responded that while he understood the concern and frustration of disability advocates, McHale had the singing and acting ability and charisma required for the role and \"it's hard to say no to someone that talented\". McHale has stated that he is pleased to represent a character in a wheelchair, and that \"I think what's great about it is just because he's in a wheelchair, he can still do what everyone else does.\" Kristin Dos Santos of E! Online refuted criticism of the episode, opining that: \"'Wheels' is all about empowering people with disabilities and sends out an uplifting message to the disabled community.\" Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times expressed a similar sentiment, stating: \"Here we have an episode bluntly addressing the complexities of disability and doing so with so much respect and dignity, and there are complaints about Artie not being wheelchair-bound  in real life? Cooooome on, guys.\" Despite playing a wheelchair user, he is actually one of the best dancers on the set, he was able to showcase his dancing skills in the 1x19 episode \"Dream On\", in which Artie imagines dancing with his Glee club friends and shoppers in a flash mob singing \"Safety Dance\" at a mall. He also showcases his dancing skills in the episode Michael, in which Artie imagines dancing and singing \"Scream\" along with Mike Chang (Harry Shum Jr.) in a remade \"Scream\" music video, and the episode Glee, Actually, in which Artie dreams about never being in a wheelchair, realizes that the lives of his friends have changed for the worse, and decides to found his own glee club, singing and dancing to Feliz Navidad.\n\nParagraph 16: The second quatrain continues this trend of excuses with subtler wording.  \"Gentle thou art\" suggests that the youth is of noble birth, and courted by many as a result.  Alexander writes that it also suggests that the youth is not \"rough and uncouth, but kind,\" and is therefore more likely to attract sexual attention and be too kind to turn it away.  Note the proverb used twice by Shakespeare, \"She's beautiful; and therefore to be Wooed: /She is a Woman; therefore to be Wonne,\" (Henry VI, 5.3.78-79) and \"Shee is a woman, therefore may be woo'd, /Shee is a woman, therefore may be wonne,\" (Titus Andronicus, 2.1.83-84) altered slightly in lines 5-6 of the sonnet.  Atkins calls lines 5-6 here, \"An intensified (not 'woo' but assail) and significantly perverse variant on the topic (women) and order (first woo then win) of a popular proverb.\"  The final excuse for the youth's infidelity is that no man can resist the advances of a woman.  Alexander argues that the observation that end the first eight lines of the poem is much more pointed than that.  \"To imply that men cannot be expected to resist women because their mothers were women is such nonsense that it is an excuse which excuses nothing.\"  Most early editors emend the \"he\" to \"she\" in line eight, with the suggestion by Thomas Tyrwhitt that \"the lady, and not the man, being in this case supposed the wooer, the poet without doubt wrote...she.\"  However, modern editors follow more in line with Martin Seymour-Smith who notes: \"The man 'prevails' in the sexual sense...so that the usual emendation 'she' for 'he' is unnecessary and wrong.  The woman wants the man to prevail.\"  Regarding lines 7–8, Duncan-Jones remarks: \"Though this sounds like an obvious truism, Shakespeare's first published work, (Venus and Adonis), described a 'woman's son', Adonis, who refuses the advances of the goddess of love.\"\n\nParagraph 17: The theories of Ubaghs are contained in a vast collection of treatises on which he expended the best years of his life. Editions followed one another as the range of his teaching widened. Ubaghs clearly affirmed the fundamental thesis of Traditionalism: the acquisition of metaphysical and moral truths is inexplicable without a primitive Divine teaching and its oral transmission. Social teaching is a natural law, a condition so necessary that without a miracle man could not, except through it, attain the explicit knowledge of truths of a metaphysical and a moral order. Teaching and language are not merely a psychological medium which favours the acquisition of these truths; their action is determinant. Hence the primordial act of man is an act of faith; the authority of others becomes the basis of certitude. The question arises: Is our adherence to the fundamental truths of the speculative and moral order blind; and, is the existence of God, which is one of them, impossible of rational demonstration? Ubaghs did not go as far as this; his Traditionalism was mitigated, a semi-Traditionalism; once teaching has awakened ideas in us and transmitted the maxims (ordo acquisitionis) reason is able and apt to comprehend them. Though powerless to discover them it is regarded as being capable of demonstrating them once they have been made known to it. One of his favourite comparisons admirably states the problem: \"As the word 'view' chiefly expresses four things, the faculty of seeing, the act of seeing, the object seen, e.g. a landscape, and the drawing an artist makes of this object, so we give the name idea, which is derived from the former, chiefly to four different things: the faculty of knowing rationally, the act of rational knowledge, the object of this knowledge, the intellectual copy or formula which we make of this object in conceiving it\" (Psychologie, 5th ed., 1857, 41–42). Now, the objective idea, or object-idea (third acceptation), in other words, the intelligible which we contemplate, and contact with which produces within us the intellectual formula (notion), is \"something Divine\" or, rather, it is God himself. This is the core of ontologism. The intelligence contemplates God directly and beholds in Him the truths or \"objective ideas\" of which our knowledge is a weak reflection. Assuredly, if Ubaghs is right, skepticism is definitively overcome. Likewise if teaching plays in the physical life the part he assigns to it, the same is true of every doctrine which asserts the original independence of reason and which Ubaghs calls rationalism. But this so-called triumph was purchased at the cost of many errors. It is, to say the least, strange that on the one hand Traditionalist Ontologism is based on a distrust of reason, and on the other hand it endows reason with unjustifiable prerogatives. Surely it is an incredible audacity to set man face to face with the Divine essence and to attribute to his weak mind the immediate perception of the eternal and immutable verities.\n\nParagraph 18: The history of Ghazl El Mahalla testifies with a lot of achievements, the club won the Egyptian Premier League in the 1972–73 season under the command of the golden generation of the club, and among its legends are Mohammed Al-Siyagi, Abdul Rahim Khalil, Muhammad Amasha, Mahmoud Abdel Dayem, and Abdul Sattar Ali. And, the club reached the final of the African Cup of Champions Clubs (Later known as CAF Champions League) in 1974 but suffered a shocking defeat at the hands of the Congolese club CARA Brazzaville. The club participated in the African Cup of Champions Clubs (Later known as CAF Champions League) the following season in 1975 but was eliminated in the semi-finals, this marked the only two participations of Ghazl El Mahalla in the most prestigious club competition in the African continent, the CAF Champions League. The only other participation of the club in an African competition was in the African Cup Winners' Cup in 2002 where it got eliminated in the quarter-finals. The club was runner-up in the 1975–76 season of the Egyptian Premier League. And, managed to reach the final of the Egypt Cup six times but fortune did not favor it in any of them and the club was never able to win the Cup. The club was also runner-up at the inaugural Egyptian Super Cup in 2001 participating as Egypt Cup runner-up after Egypt Cup champions Ismaily SC withdrew from the competition. The club participated in the 1995 Arab Cup Winners' Cup, which was held in Tunisia, where it achieved third place. The club also participated in the 2004–05 Arab Champions League but got eliminated from the group stage after ending up in the fourth spot in Group B of the competition, this marked the only two participations of Ghazl El Mahalla in Arab competitions.\n\nParagraph 19: Puck makes infrequent guest appearances starting from this season. Puck is devastated by Finn's death. In \"The Quarterback\", three weeks after the funeral, he steals a memorial tree planted for Finn and demands that Kurt, Finn's stepbrother, give him Finn's football jacket. Coach Beiste takes him to task for being drunk regularly after so many weeks, and the two mourn Finn together, but Beiste tells him he has to guide his own life without Finn's help, and asks him to replant the tree. When he later does so, he tells her that he intends to join the Air Force. In \"100\" Now in the Air Force, Puck comes back to McKinley to say goodbye to the Glee Club before it is disbanded. He sees Quinn and the two of them have a conversation. He is about to tell Quinn that he still has feelings for her when her boyfriend, Biff McIntosh, shows up and shows Puck that he is rude. Puck sings Avril Lavigne's song Keep Holding On to her hoping that this would win her heart, but she turns him down stating that she loves Biff. Later, Quinn and Biff are having dinner at Breadsticks when Santana, Puck, Mike, and Artie show up. They sit with Quinn at her table and Biff reveals that he doesn't know any thing about Quinn's past. Her friends tell her about her behavior in the episode The Purple Piano Project. Quinn asks Biff to get something out of the car for her and after he leaves, she asks her friends not to mention anything to Biff since she is ashamed of her past. Puck asks her if she is ever going to tell him about their relationship and their daughter, Beth, and she says that she will eventually. This somewhat angers Puck as he tells her that she can't hide from the past and should embrace it. A few days later, Puck is hanging by the school buses when he hears Quinn and Biff fighting. Biff becomes angry with her at the fact that she kept so much from him, including having a baby with Puck. He calls her a slut, causing Puck to snap and punch him. Biff punches Puck back, causing Puck to punch him once more and then throws him into the dumpster. He then tells Quinn that she can help Biff out of the dumpster or join her real friends in the choir room. Later, Puck and Quinn are in the locker room looking at Finn's plaque. Quinn tells Puck that Biff went back to Yale by himself, and the relationship is over. Puck reveals that he still has feelings for her and wants to get back together. Quinn tells Puck that she isn't going to look back to her past, as she wants to look into her future. Puck leaves the locker room heartbroken and storms down the hallway when Quinn runs after him and kisses him, agreeing to give their relationship another chance.\n\nParagraph 20: Puck makes infrequent guest appearances starting from this season.

The rank existed in the cavalry, infantry, pioneers, and artillery where the Gefreiter rank received a greater rank-class status. Gefreiter was the only enlisted rank until 1918 within the Royal Prussian Army and respectively the imperial army of the German Empire to which an exceptional enlisted soldier could be promoted on the recommendation of the Hauptmann (Captain) or Rittmeister (Cavalry-Master otherwise Captain) and ultimately endorsed by the Regiments-Commandeur (Regimental Colonel), with exception of the rank Obergefreiter (since 1859) in the foot artillery which later replaced the artillery Bombardier (Corporal) rank. The Gefreiter rank was also considered a transition rank for promotion to and wherefrom replacements were selected to the Unteroffizier (Corporal) rank. Within the Royal Prussian Army and respectively the imperial army of the German Empire, the rank Gefreiter was a deputy to the Unteroffizier (Corporal), and were distinguished by the wearing of a Auszeichnungsknopf (rank Distinction-button) known as the Gefreitenknopf (Gefreiter-button) on each side of their uniform collar, similar to the slightly larger rank collar side-buttons worn by both the Sergeant and Feldwebel ranks.\n\nParagraph 23: In August 1999, Cherny attacked a girl, hitting her and pushing her into the bushes, and trying to strangle her. However, the girl cried out, and when he saw that a man was approaching, Cherny ran away. On September 19, Cherny strangled a girl in the vicinity of the town of Komintern, who was going to a disco. He took off her outer garments and pulled the earrings from her ears. The body was soon found in a ravine near the place of the murder. On September 24, Cherny also killed another girl at the spring in the Redovka Park in the same way. At her neck, a bra was tied tightly in a knot. The deceased had lost a leather jacket, leather waistcoat, a breastplate, a bunch of keys and a ticket. On September 27, in the village of Vishenka, in an abandoned warehouse, the corpse of a girl was found, with signs of strangulation, who went missing on September 24. On the neck a belt from the jacket was tied in two knots. On September 29, in front of GSK \"Tikhvinka-3\" the body of another strangled girl was found. A loop of thin strap from a purse was fastened around her neck and tied back to two knots. UVD Smolensk seriously engaged in the disclosure of the murder series, and the killer, feeling the danger, \"fell to the bottom\", not betraying himself and not committing new atrocities. A month later, the murderer reappeared, strangling two more girls in three days. On November 4, near the Yasennaya River, which flowed in the ravine between the village of Vishenka and the garage-building cooperative \"Svet-2\", a corpse of a girl was found, photographs of whom were hanging on search trays for two days around the city. On the neck of the deceased, the murderer had tied handkerchief and a belt from his coat tightly around her neck, and her outer clothing, a gold ring, earrings and a watch were stolen. On November 6, in the forest belt in the nuclear power plant-80 area, half a kilometer from the Krasninskoe highway, the body of another victim was found, and had lost her passport and student card. On November 22, Cherny met a girl in the city centre. The next day, he invited her to go on a walk and get some fresh air, to which she agreed. When they met, they got into his car and went for a drive. Suddenly, Cherny attacked the companion, tried to strangle her, then threw her into the trunk and drove her to the outskirts, where he hung her from a tree with her own sneakers' shoelaces. However, the girl survived and soon turned to the police, but because of the shock experienced, she was confused and could not provide any valuable information. In early December, the investigators managed to find the victim who survived the August attack, who said that she had seen the criminal in one of the city's markets. For several days she was taken to the markets of Smolensk, and on December 14 she pointed the detectives on the man who attacked her. The suspect was placed on surveillance round the clock, including using a hidden camera. When they looked through the record with the suspect's image, one of the detectives said that he knew a very similar person - a member of a local criminal group named Mark Cherny. It turned out that Mark was the younger brother of the main suspect - a 22-year-old security guard of a private security company Sergey Cherny. Meanwhile, corpses were still found around the city. On December 17, in the ravine for GSK \"Zvezda\" in the second Krasninskiy lane the corpse of another girl was found with a leather belt from a coat tied on two knots around her neck. On December 22 near the Yasennaya River in the \"Readovka\" park another corpse was found. Subsequently, the Cherny brothers were detained.\n\nParagraph 24: Daniels' first of many collaborations with the Marshall Tucker Band came on the band's second album, A New Life, which was released in 1974, and certified gold in 1977. Daniels and blues guitarist Elvin Bishop were among several musicians that joined the band for Where We All Belong, a double-album (one studio album and one live album) released by the band in 1974 and certified gold that same year.  The following year the band's Searchin' for a Rainbow was also certified gold the year of its release, and contained the track \"Fire on the Mountain,\" which peaked at No. 38 on the Billboard charts. Long Hard Ride, the band's fifth consecutive gold album, was released in 1976, and its instrumental title track (which again features Charlie Daniels on fiddle) was nominated for a Grammy. Carolina Dreams, released in 1977 and certified platinum that same year, proved to be the band's most commercially successful album, and included the track \"Heard It in a Love Song,\" which reached No. 14 on the Billboard charts.  The band's final Capricorn release came with 1978's Together Forever, which was produced by Stewart Levine. Following the bankruptcy of Capricorn, the Marshall Tucker Band moved to Warner Bros. Records for their ninth album, Running Like the Wind (the band's eighth release was a compilation album entitled Greatest Hits), and they retained Levine as the album's producer.\n\nParagraph 25: \"Villain of the week\" (or, depending on genre, \"monster of the week\", \"freak of the week\" or \"alien of the week\") is an antagonist that only appears in one episode of a multi-episode work of fiction. A villain of the week is commonly seen in British, American, and Japanese genre-based television series. As many shows of this type air episodes weekly at a rate of ten to twenty new episodes per year, there is often a new antagonist in the plot of each week's episode. The main characters usually confront and vanquish these characters, often leaving them never to be seen again as in wordly famous Doctor Who, Supernatural, but also Charmed, Smallville, and Scooby-Doo. Some series alternate between using such antagonists and furthering the series' ongoing plotlines (as in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Supernatural, Fringe, and The X-Files, where fandom is often divided over preference for one type of episode versus the other), while others use these one-time foes as pawns of the recurring adversaries (as in Kamen Rider, Sailor Moon, Ultra series and as well as in Super Sentai and its American equivalent, Power Rangers). On other occasions, these villains return reformed, becoming invaluable allies or gaining a larger role in the story. The American action drama Burn Notice focuses on short-lived antagonists, but the final portion of every episode is committed to developing a larger story arc. The British Doctor Who spin-off programme Torchwood used this format in its first two series, before switching to a continuous story format.\n\nParagraph 26: The precise borders of traditional Gooreng Gooreng lands have been disputed. Walter Roth, while collecting data on their language in the later 19th century, placed them in Camboon Rawbelle where their main camp was at that time, Jiggings\". Norman Tindale distinguished them from a Goeng Meerooni Coastal people (1770/Agnes) and defined their land as extending over  and embracing the eastern bank of the upper Burnett River from Mundubbera north to Callide Ranges Queensland and East to Mt Perry Ranges and  Many Peaks. It is possible that a confusion arose, taking two distinct dialect forms of the one cultural complex, to denote distinct and separate realities, with the Gureng Gureng taken to be an inland tribe, and the Goeng (Meerooni) denoting their affines on the coast. A recent survey of the available evidence concludes that the Goreng goring's lands encompassed the \"whole of Boyne Valley to Auburn NoGo Callide Cania Ranges No Coastal Reef Dialect Language exists as Kooreng Gooreng Gooreng Gooreng are inland Freshwater People\n\nParagraph 27: Daniels' first of many collaborations with the Marshall Tucker Band came on the band's second album, A New Life, which was released in 1974, and certified gold in 1977. Daniels and blues guitarist Elvin Bishop were among several musicians that joined the band for Where We All Belong, a double-album (one studio album and one live album) released by the band in 1974 and certified gold that same year.  The following year the band's Searchin' for a Rainbow was also certified gold the year of its release, and contained the track \"Fire on the Mountain,\" which peaked at No. 38 on the Billboard charts. Long Hard Ride, the band's fifth consecutive gold album, was released in 1976, and its instrumental title track (which again features Charlie Daniels on fiddle) was nominated for a Grammy. Carolina Dreams, released in 1977 and certified platinum that same year, proved to be the band's most commercially successful album, and included the track \"Heard It in a Love Song,\" which reached No. 14 on the Billboard charts.  The band's final Capricorn release came with 1978's Together Forever, which was produced by Stewart Levine. Following the bankruptcy of Capricorn, the Marshall Tucker Band moved to Warner Bros. Records for their ninth album, Running Like the Wind (the band's eighth release was a compilation album entitled Greatest Hits), and they retained Levine as the album's producer.\n\nParagraph 28: Accounts of the success of the opera vary greatly.  The Mercure Galant states that the opera was extremely well received; that audiences were enthralled by Lully's music as always and that they would never have guessed that Corneille had composed the libretto in so little time as three weeks.  On the other hand, the Frères Parfraict in their Histoire de l'académie royale de musique claim that the opera is \"irremediably cold\" and that \"the diabolical character of Venus ruins what little galantry there is to be found\" in it.  These reports are both equally difficult to believe when one considers, on the one hand, that Thomas Corneille was one of the chief editors of the Mercure Galant and, on the other hand, in what contempt the Parfaict brothers held all authors of the 17th century other than Pierre Corneille, Molière, Jean Racine and, for opera, Philippe Quinault.  Might they have felt obligated to condemn Thomas Corneille's libretto out of fidelity to his brother, Molière and most of all Quinault whose place Thomas Corneille may have thought he was usurping indefinitely?  The Parfaict brothers' attitude seems to have remained the dominant one since the 18th century. Robert Fajon, in his Opéra à Paris du Roi Soleil à Louis le Bien-Aimé, even goes so far as to accuse Thomas Corneille of being responsible for Lully's only operatic failure.  Concretely, however, none of Lully's operas were a failure.  Their success continued to daunt operatic composers well into the 18th century.  It is true that Psyché, unlike many of Lully's operas, was not created at court and was only revived twice (once in 1703 and again in 1713).  Thésée, by comparison was revived ten times and remained in the repertoire of the Académie royale de musique until 1744.\n\nParagraph 29: William Damaschke (born November 20, 1963) is the former President of Animation and Family Entertainment for Skydance Media, where he served as the key architect setting the overall creative direction and strategy for Skydance. In conjunction with the company's feature film and television division, he curated and oversaw a team dedicated to producing a bold and original slate of both animated and hybrid family programming. Previously, he had spent 20 years at DreamWorks Animation, most recently as Chief Creative Officer, where he was involved in the creative, artistic, and operational direction of the company. His tenure oversaw the release of some of the company's big franchise films, including Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda, How to Train Your Dragon and The Croods. He also oversaw all of DreamWorks's live theatrical productions, including the award-winning Shrek the Musical.  Damaschke’s other projects as a producer include the Broadway musical The Prom, directed and choreographed by Casey Nicholaw, which played at the Longacre Theatre from 15 November 2018 to 11 August 2019; the Broadway-bound musical Half Time, directed and choreographed by Jerry Mitchell, which was presented at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Spring of 2018; and the stage adaptation of Moulin Rouge, directed by Alex Timers, on which Damaschke serves as executive producer.\n\nParagraph 30: Puck makes infrequent guest appearances starting from this season. Puck is devastated by Finn's death. In \"The Quarterback\", three weeks after the funeral, he steals a memorial tree planted for Finn and demands that Kurt, Finn's stepbrother, give him Finn's football jacket. Coach Beiste takes him to task for being drunk regularly after so many weeks, and the two mourn Finn together, but Beiste tells him he has to guide his own life without Finn's help, and asks him to replant the tree. When he later does so, he tells her that he intends to join the Air Force. In \"100\" Now in the Air Force, Puck comes back to McKinley to say goodbye to the Glee Club before it is disbanded. He sees Quinn and the two of them have a conversation. He is about to tell Quinn that he still has feelings for her when her boyfriend, Biff McIntosh, shows up and shows Puck that he is rude. Puck sings Avril Lavigne's song Keep Holding On to her hoping that this would win her heart, but she turns him down stating that she loves Biff. Later, Quinn and Biff are having dinner at Breadsticks when Santana, Puck, Mike, and Artie show up. They sit with Quinn at her table and Biff reveals that he doesn't know any thing about Quinn's past. Her friends tell her about her behavior in the episode The Purple Piano Project. Quinn asks Biff to get something out of the car for her and after he leaves, she asks her friends not to mention anything to Biff since she is ashamed of her past. Puck asks her if she is ever going to tell him about their relationship and their daughter, Beth, and she says that she will eventually. This somewhat angers Puck as he tells her that she can't hide from the past and should embrace it. A few days later, Puck is hanging by the school buses when he hears Quinn and Biff fighting. Biff becomes angry with her at the fact that she kept so much from him, including having a baby with Puck. He calls her a slut, causing Puck to snap and punch him. Biff punches Puck back, causing Puck to punch him once more and then throws him into the dumpster. He then tells Quinn that she can help Biff out of the dumpster or join her real friends in the choir room. Later, Puck and Quinn are in the locker room looking at Finn's plaque. Quinn tells Puck that Biff went back to Yale by himself, and the relationship is over. Puck reveals that he still has feelings for her and wants to get back together. Quinn tells Puck that she isn't going to look back to her past, as she wants to look into her future. Puck leaves the locker room heartbroken and storms down the hallway when Quinn runs after him and kisses him, agreeing to give their relationship another chance.\n\nParagraph 31: In housing policy, a shift of emphasis in housing policy towards rehabilitation was evident in the further increase in the number of General Improvement Areas and the number of Housing Action Areas declared. An Act of March 1977 makes provision, for a limited period, for benefits to be paid from the age of 64 to workers who agree to retire in order to free jobs for young unemployed people, in response to the rise of youth unemployment. A number of other improvements were introduced in 1977, with Attendance Allowances extended to cover disabled foster children and non-contributory disablement pensions extended to married women whose invalidity prevented them from carrying out their household tasks. In January 1977, regulations were issued which brought about a change in the administration of legislation governing fire precautions at places of work. Under these regulations the Health and Safety Executive retained full responsibility for fire safety in certain 'special' premises such as nuclear installations, coalmines and chemical plants, whereas responsibility for general fire precautions at places of work was transferred to local fire authorities. A number of new services and benefits for disabled people were also introduced. A Non-Contributory Invalidity Pension in lieu of ‘pocket money’ allowance for long-stay patients in mental hospitals was introduced. The therapeutic earnings limit for recipients of Invalidity Pension, Non-Contributory Invalidity Pension and Unemployability Supplement was raised while the Private Car Maintenance Allowance for War Pensioners was increased. From the 29th of August 1977, Attendance Allowance became payable to foster parents of disabled children, and was also extended to kidney patients dialysing at home. Industrial injury provisions for occupational deafness were introduced, and viral hepatitis and Vinyl Chloride Monomer induced diseases were prescribed as industrial diseases. Easing of conditions for entitlement to industrial death benefit in certain cases of death from pulmonary disease was carried out. £12.1 million was paid to the Rowntree Trust Family Fund for disabled children, while the terms of reference of the Rowntree Trust Family Fund were extended to include all severely disabled children. Limited right of appeal on diagnosis of pneumoconiosis was also introduced. A phasing in of a new behind-the-ear hearing aid for up 1 million hearing impaired people was carried out. Special hearing aids for children and young people were introduced. Audiology services were developed, Hearing Therapists were introduced, and the Blind Person’s tax allowance was increased. Improvements were made to the wheel-chair service, while further parking concessions were made for all ‘Orange Badge’ holders. In addition, the ‘Orange Badge’ scheme was extended to include the blind, and concessions to ‘Orange Badge’ holders at most tolled crossings were introduced. The petrol allowance was also restored and doubled for drivers of government-supplied invalid vehicles. Another measure was the extension of exemption from Road Tax (vehicle excise duty) to Mobility Allowance beneficiaries or their nominees. Concessionary fares for disabled people were introduced, along with a discretionary allowance of up to £160 to disabled students whose disability led to additional expenses in connection with their studies. Improved provision for the needs of disabled people in educational establishments was carried out, and a scheme of grants was made to employers “towards the cost of adaptations to premises or equipment made to enable disabled individuals to obtain, or retain, employment.” The 4th of July 1977 saw the inception of an experimental Job Introduction Scheme “to provide financial assistance enabling certain disabled people to undertake a trial period of employment with an employer, where there is reasonable doubt as to the person’s ability to perform a particular job.” On the 5th of July 1978 a revised and simplified scheme designed to help severely disabled people with their travel-to-work costs was introduced. Increased allowances were paid to people going on employment rehabilitation courses, while under the MSC Special Programme for young people additional opportunities were provided at Employment Rehabilitation Centres for disabled young people. A Release for Training (RFT) scheme was introduced for disabled people already in employment “but experiencing problems which can only be resolved by a period of intensive training.”  District Handicap Teams were set up, the War Pensioners’ visiting scheme was extended, and zero rating of VAT was introduced “on aids and appliances for disabled people and also on medical equipment for donation to a hospital for the purpose of treatment or research.” New arrangements were introduced for dental treatment of disabled patients, and special concessionary TV license arrangements were extended for people in old people’s homes.\n\nParagraph 32: The cuisine of the Tagalog people varies by province. Bulacan is popular for Chicharrón (pork rinds) and steamed rice and tuber cakes like puto. It is a center for panghimagas or desserts, like brown rice cake or kutsinta, sapin-sapin, suman, cassava cake, ube halaya and the king of sweets, in San Miguel, Bulacan, the famous carabao milk candy pastillas de leche, with its pabalat wrapper. Cainta, in Rizal province east of Manila, is known for its Filipino rice cakes and puddings. These are usually topped with latik, a mixture of coconut milk and brown sugar, reduced to a dry crumbly texture. A more modern, and time saving alternative to latik are coconut flakes toasted in a frying pan. Antipolo, straddled mid-level in the mountainous regions of the Philippine Sierra Madre, is a town known for its suman and cashew products. Laguna is known for buko pie (coconut pie) and panutsa (peanut brittle). Batangas is home to Taal Lake, a body of water that surrounds Taal Volcano. The lake is home to 75 species of freshwater fish, including landlocked marine species that have since adapted to the Taal lake environment. Eight of these species are of high commercial value. These include a population of giant trevally locally known as maliputo which is distinguished from their marine counterparts which are known as talakitok. Another commercially important species is the tawilis, the only known freshwater sardine and endemic to the lake. Batangas is also known for its special coffee, kapeng barako. Quezon, especially the town of Lucban, is also known for its culinary dishes, with Lucban longganisa, pancit habhab, and hardinera being the most notable. The influence of coconut milk dishes, such as laing (called tinuto in some places in Quezon) and sinantol, is also felt in the province because of its proximity to Bicol. Suman is also a notable food in the province, especially in the town of Infanta and the city of Tayabas, though having the same ingredients as the one in Antipolo, the things that makes Infanta and Tayabas suman unique is its packaging and size; Infanta's suman is smaller in size and is usually grouped into 20 per pack, while Tayabas' suman is also unique in packaging, with a long tail that makes it look like a lit candle, in connection to its tradition of throwing suman during the feast of the city's patron, Isidore the Laborer.\n\nParagraph 33: In addition, slave owners manumitted slaves for various reasons: to reward long years of service, because heirs did not want to take on slaves, or to free slave concubines and/or their children. Slaves were sometimes allowed to buy their freedom; they might be permitted to save money from fees paid when they were \"hired out\" to work for other parties. In the mid-to-late 18th century, Methodist and Baptist evangelists during the period of the First Great Awakening ( 1730–1755) encouraged slave owners to free their slaves, in their belief that all men were equal before God. They converted many slaves to Christianity and approved black leaders as preachers; blacks developed their own strain of Christianity. Before the American Revolutionary War of 1775–1783, few slaves were manumitted; on the eve of the American Revolution, there was an estimated 30,000 free African Americans in Colonial America which accounts for about 5% of the total African American population with most of free African Americans being mixed race. Since the portion of free African Americans were so small and could possibly pass as white, they were not deemed a threat to the White population to warrant anti-Black legislation. However, historian Ira Berlin states that this figure could be as high as 25% due to errors in census collection, ambiguous status of runaway slaves, White-passing persons, and slaves who lived as if they were free but did not have the papers to prove the same.\n\nParagraph 34: In addition, slave owners manumitted slaves for various reasons: to reward long years of service, because heirs did not want to take on slaves, or to free slave concubines and/or their children.

His first goal came against Turkey on 14 October that year, in an 8–0 victory at Wembley in a Euro 88 qualifier. He appeared in two of England's group games at Euro 88 (which all ended in defeat), but his next international appearance – against Denmark in a friendly on 14 September 1988 – he scored the only goal in the game at Wembley. On 3 June 1989, he scored the third international goal of his career with a 3–0 World Cup qualifier victory over Poland, again at Wembley. On 24 April 1990 Webb made his first appearance with the England B team, playing in the 2–0 win over the Czechoslovakia B team at Roker Park. Despite missing the bulk of the 1989–90 season at Manchester United with injury, he was included in England's 1990 World Cup squad and made his solitary appearance of the competition in the third place playoff defeat by Italy. Before the year was out he would become the first player to be sent off whilst on England duty in three years when he saw red for the England B team in a match against the full Algeria team. On 12 May 1992, he scored what would be his final goal for England in a 1–0 friendly win over Hungary in Budapest. He would make four more international appearances for England, the last coming on 17 June 1992 when England lost 2–1 to hosts Sweden in their final Euro 92 group game. Webb was capped 26 times in five years for the England team, and scored 4 goals.\n\nParagraph 36: He was amongst the first to respond to the call of Pakistan sounded by Muhammad Iqbal in 1930 (Qutote from Chaudhry Muhammad Ali, Prime Minister of Pakistan), Dr. Khursheed kamal aziz Pakistan's official historian) has described this book as \"the most comprehensive and far reaching scheme aimed at furthering and elaborating the idea of Pakistan.  Waheed uz-Zaman wrote in his book, \"Pakistan\", Lahore, 1964, P. 168, \"The book was taken into consideration by the Muslim league, while preparing the Lahore resolution and the fact the solution proposed in the confederacy of India\" differed but little from the proposed by the Muslim League in March 1940. The venear of a Confederacy, which was the main theme of his scheme, could anytime be set aside and the remainder would have precisely ... Pakistan.  So scholarly and so cogent was his reasoning that men like Dr.Rajendra Prasad felt compelled to join issues with him in his books, (Pakistan(Bombay and Calcutta, September 1940), p 34; see also his book \"India Divided\" page 180-181). The book was reviewed in leading newspapers and journals. Comparatively more scholarly appraisal was in the Tarjaman-ul-Quran of Maulana Abul Ala Maududi. According to Mian Kifait Ali \"The idea was suggested to me by the late Choudhary Rahmat Ali's writings and I developmed it to an extent to which no one had done earlier (Letter to Dr. K.K, September 5, 1968)\". Ali also stated that originally it was proposed to publish the book under the title of \"Pakistan\" a typed manuscript which bore this page title was sent to the press. Soon after he received a telegraphic message from the Muhammad Ali Jinnah that book should not appear under the pen name of \"Pakistan\". It was to comply with the Quaid's directive he prepared a federal scheme and was incorporated in the introduction of the book. Thus the book was titled as \"Confederacy of India\". (Nation article, 23 December 1994 by Sarfraz Hussain Mirza, \"Confederacy of India by A Punjabi\", also in Daily Times, Cam Diary, \"Pak history in Leichester\", and article by V.P Bhatia \"'Jinnah was against the name 'Pakistan' at First\". It was in recognition of this work of Mian Kifait Ali that he was invited to work on the committee presided over by Sir Abdullah Haroon set up in February 1940 to examine the various schemes of constitutional reforms for India and to see whether a consolidated scheme can finally be framed.  His book has been referred to as the most comprehensive schemes at demystifying and detailing the ideas regarding the inception of Pakistan, quite a lot has been written about him and his work. Mian Kifait Ali has done \"pioneering work in the evolution of Muslim political thoughts and has suffered the hardship of a pioneer… when an objective appraisal of Muslim political movement is made by the historian. He will find an honourable place among the pioneers and selfless workers in this great field of Muslim reconstruction (Quoted by Governor Punjab, Mushtaq Ahmed Gurmani). Famous independence-era personalities such as Abul Ala Maududi, Chaudhry Muhammad Ali, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Vengalil Krishnan Krishna Menon, and Sardar V. Patel took issue with him. He responded in several pamphlets.\n\nParagraph 37: Meanwhile, Kigan's pandal attracts crowds. Bodhi makes plans to create fake bomb blasts in the puja campus and create a mess. According to his plans a terrible mess occurs at the pandal, several people are stampeded. Bodhi even pays the media to cover this incident exclusively and promote it more seriously than the actual incident, eventually the police authorities ban the puja and order for the dismantle of the idol after puja. Kigan is put into jail for quarrelling with police. Later Bodhi releases Kigan from jail and on way to home he explains Kigan that he took his revenge by getting the puja banned from public. Kigan requests Bodhi to open the puja after 2–3 days but Bodhi disagrees. Kigan then challenges Bodhi that he would reopen the puja till immersion. Meanwhile, Kigan owns up to his mistakes to Aditi and they get reunited again. Next day Kigan investigates that only two persons were injured not many and it was a paid fake news. Kigan has meetings with police commissioner, governor regarding reopening of the puja but everywhere he gets negative response. Out of utter depression Kigan goes to Bodhi's house, determined that Bodhi is responsible for all this and he would kill Bodhi. Kigan and Bodhi have a fight where Kigan is about to kill Bodhi but then Bodhi's son attacks Kigan with a bat and Kigan falls. Bodhi scolds his son for hitting an elder person but Kigan supports him. Then Bodhi tells that he doesn't want to make his son like Kigan, so he will teach him proper manners. Here Bodhi discloses that his son is not his but actually Kigan's and he has tendered him as his own child and always has been a good father because he wants to make him a gentleman and an not as irresponsible as Kigan. Bodhi also discloses that Aditi has always been loving Kigan though Bodhi has always been a good husband. Even though he has brought up Kigan's child as his own child, Aditi has never developed any feeling towards him so he decided to finish Kigan who has destroyed his own family for that he has also destroyed his masterpiece creation. Bodhi repents that he is the Asur (villain) and begs pardon from Kigan. Bodhi also discloses that he is not the only one associated with this planning but Aditi is also responsible for this. Aditi thought of taking revenge from Kigan after her father's incident so she had been involved in this case.\n\nParagraph 38: In housing policy, a shift of emphasis in housing policy towards rehabilitation was evident in the further increase in the number of General Improvement Areas and the number of Housing Action Areas declared.

Last night, he got a much-deserved moment in the spotlight, and he rolled with it, doing his best Richie Sambora on the talk box, then taking lead vocals on the Usher track.\" The episode \"Wheels\", which placed focus on Artie and his disability, drew criticism from a committee of performers with disabilities, who felt that casting a non-disabled actor to play a disabled student was inappropriate. CSI star Robert David Hall commented, \"I think there's a fear of litigation, that a person with disabilities might slow a production down, fear that viewers might be uncomfortable.\" Glee creator Brad Falchuk responded that while he understood the concern and frustration of disability advocates, McHale had the singing and acting ability and charisma required for the role and \"it's hard to say no to someone that talented\". McHale has stated that he is pleased to represent a character in a wheelchair, and that \"I think what's great about it is just because he's in a wheelchair, he can still do what everyone else does.\" Kristin Dos Santos of E! Online refuted criticism of the episode, opining that: \"'Wheels' is all about empowering people with disabilities and sends out an uplifting message to the disabled community.\" Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times expressed a similar sentiment, stating: \"Here we have an episode bluntly addressing the complexities of disability and doing so with so much respect and dignity, and there are complaints about Artie not being wheelchair-bound  in real life? Cooooome on, guys.\" Despite playing a wheelchair user, he is actually one of the best dancers on the set, he was able to showcase his dancing skills in the 1x19 episode \"Dream On\", in which Artie imagines dancing with his Glee club friends and shoppers in a flash mob singing \"Safety Dance\" at a mall. He also showcases his dancing skills in the episode Michael, in which Artie imagines dancing and singing \"Scream\" along with Mike Chang (Harry Shum Jr.) in a remade \"Scream\" music video, and the episode Glee, Actually, in which Artie dreams about never being in a wheelchair, realizes that the lives of his friends have changed for the worse, and decides to found his own glee club, singing and dancing to Feliz Navidad.\n\nParagraph 40: In August 1999, Cherny attacked a girl, hitting her and pushing her into the bushes, and trying to strangle her. However, the girl cried out, and when he saw that a man was approaching, Cherny ran away. On September 19, Cherny strangled a girl in the vicinity of the town of Komintern, who was going to a disco. He took off her outer garments and pulled the earrings from her ears. The body was soon found in a ravine near the place of the murder. On September 24, Cherny also killed another girl at the spring in the Redovka Park in the same way. At her neck, a bra was tied tightly in a knot. The deceased had lost a leather jacket, leather waistcoat, a breastplate, a bunch of keys and a ticket. On September 27, in the village of Vishenka, in an abandoned warehouse, the corpse of a girl was found, with signs of strangulation, who went missing on September 24. On the neck a belt from the jacket was tied in two knots. On September 29, in front of GSK \"Tikhvinka-3\" the body of another strangled girl was found. A loop of thin strap from a purse was fastened around her neck and tied back to two knots. UVD Smolensk seriously engaged in the disclosure of the murder series, and the killer, feeling the danger, \"fell to the bottom\", not betraying himself and not committing new atrocities. A month later, the murderer reappeared, strangling two more girls in three days. On November 4, near the Yasennaya River, which flowed in the ravine between the village of Vishenka and the garage-building cooperative \"Svet-2\", a corpse of a girl was found, photographs of whom were hanging on search trays for two days around the city. On the neck of the deceased, the murderer had tied handkerchief and a belt from his coat tightly around her neck, and her outer clothing, a gold ring, earrings and a watch were stolen. On November 6, in the forest belt in the nuclear power plant-80 area, half a kilometer from the Krasninskoe highway, the body of another victim was found, and had lost her passport and student card. On November 22, Cherny met a girl in the city centre. The next day, he invited her to go on a walk and get some fresh air, to which she agreed. When they met, they got into his car and went for a drive. Suddenly, Cherny attacked the companion, tried to strangle her, then threw her into the trunk and drove her to the outskirts, where he hung her from a tree with her own sneakers' shoelaces. However, the girl survived and soon turned to the police, but because of the shock experienced, she was confused and could not provide any valuable information. In early December, the investigators managed to find the victim who survived the August attack, who said that she had seen the criminal in one of the city's markets. For several days she was taken to the markets of Smolensk, and on December 14 she pointed the detectives on the man who attacked her. The suspect was placed on surveillance round the clock, including using a hidden camera. When they looked through the record with the suspect's image, one of the detectives said that he knew a very similar person - a member of a local criminal group named Mark Cherny. It turned out that Mark was the younger brother of the main suspect - a 22-year-old security guard of a private security company Sergey Cherny. Meanwhile, corpses were still found around the city. On December 17, in the ravine for GSK \"Zvezda\" in the second Krasninskiy lane the corpse of another girl was found with a leather belt from a coat tied on two knots around her neck. On December 22 near the Yasennaya River in the \"Readovka\" park another corpse was found. Subsequently, the Cherny brothers were detained.\n\nParagraph 41: The history of Ghazl El Mahalla testifies with a lot of achievements, the club won the Egyptian Premier League in the 1972–73 season under the command of the golden generation of the club, and among its legends are Mohammed Al-Siyagi, Abdul Rahim Khalil, Muhammad Amasha, Mahmoud Abdel Dayem, and Abdul Sattar Ali. And, the club reached the final of the African Cup of Champions Clubs (Later known as CAF Champions League) in 1974 but suffered a shocking defeat at the hands of the Congolese club CARA Brazzaville. The club participated in the African Cup of Champions Clubs (Later known as CAF Champions League) the following season in 1975 but was eliminated in the semi-finals, this marked the only two participations of Ghazl El Mahalla in the most prestigious club competition in the African continent, the CAF Champions League. The only other participation of the club in an African competition was in the African Cup Winners' Cup in 2002 where it got eliminated in the quarter-finals. The club was runner-up in the 1975–76 season of the Egyptian Premier League. And, managed to reach the final of the Egypt Cup six times but fortune did not favor it in any of them and the club was never able to win the Cup. The club was also runner-up at the inaugural Egyptian Super Cup in 2001 participating as Egypt Cup runner-up after Egypt Cup champions Ismaily SC withdrew from the competition. The club participated in the 1995 Arab Cup Winners' Cup, which was held in Tunisia, where it achieved third place. The club also participated in the 2004–05 Arab Champions League but got eliminated from the group stage after ending up in the fourth spot in Group B of the competition, this marked the only two participations of Ghazl El Mahalla in Arab competitions.\n\nParagraph 42: Shawna Malcom of the Los Angeles Times reviewed the episode \"Vitamin D\" positively, praising the focus it gave Artie: \"Until now, the wheelchair-bound character has served mostly as a punchline. Last night, he got a much-deserved moment in the spotlight, and he rolled with it, doing his best Richie Sambora on the talk box, then taking lead vocals on the Usher track.\" The episode \"Wheels\", which placed focus on Artie and his disability, drew criticism from a committee of performers with disabilities, who felt that casting a non-disabled actor to play a disabled student was inappropriate. CSI star Robert David Hall commented, \"I think there's a fear of litigation, that a person with disabilities might slow a production down, fear that viewers might be uncomfortable.\" Glee creator Brad Falchuk responded that while he understood the concern and frustration of disability advocates, McHale had the singing and acting ability and charisma required for the role and \"it's hard to say no to someone that talented\". McHale has stated that he is pleased to represent a character in a wheelchair, and that \"I think what's great about it is just because he's in a wheelchair, he can still do what everyone else does.\" Kristin Dos Santos of E! Online refuted criticism of the episode, opining that: \"'Wheels' is all about empowering people with disabilities and sends out an uplifting message to the disabled community.\" Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times expressed a similar sentiment, stating: \"Here we have an episode bluntly addressing the complexities of disability and doing so with so much respect and dignity, and there are complaints about Artie not being wheelchair-bound  in real life? Cooooome on, guys.\" Despite playing a wheelchair user, he is actually one of the best dancers on the set, he was able to showcase his dancing skills in the 1x19 episode \"Dream On\", in which Artie imagines dancing with his Glee club friends and shoppers in a flash mob singing \"Safety Dance\" at a mall. He also showcases his dancing skills in the episode Michael, in which Artie imagines dancing and singing \"Scream\" along with Mike Chang (Harry Shum Jr.) in a remade \"Scream\" music video, and the episode Glee, Actually, in which Artie dreams about never being in a wheelchair, realizes that the lives of his friends have changed for the worse, and decides to found his own glee club, singing and dancing to Feliz Navidad.\n\nParagraph 43: October 28 – Led by Steve Pearce and David Price, the Boston Red Sox ended the World Series in five games with a 5–1 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium. Winners of a franchise-record 108 games during the season, the Red Sox buried the AL East Division across six months and claimed 11 more victories in the playoffs, knocking off the 100-win New York Yankees in the ALDS, the defending World Series champion Houston Astros in the ALCS,  and the two-time NL champion Dodgers in the Fall Classic, while losing just one game in each round. Pearce hit a two-run home run off Clayton Kershaw in the top of the first inning, and the Red Sox took a lead they would never give back. Solo homers by Mookie Betts in the sixth inning and J. D. Martinez in the seventh quieted the Dodger Stadium crowd, while Pearce struck again with a solo shot off Pedro Báez to make it 5–1 in the eighth. Those homers came just a day after Pearce crushed a tying home run in the eighth inning of Game 4, followed by a three-run double that broke the game open in the ninth. Price limited the Dodgers to a solo homer by David Freese on his first pitch and otherwise shut them down over seven-plus innings, allowing just two more hits, striking out five and walking two, while retiring 14 in a row before giving a leadoff walk in the eighth inning. Price was followed by Joe Kelly, who struck out three straight pinch hitters, and Chris Sale, who was originally scheduled to start an eventual Game 5. But Sale finished off the Dodgers in style, striking out the side in the ninth and Manny Machado swinging to end it. Pierce earned World Series MVP honors by collecting four hits— three homers and a double in 12 at bats – along with eight RBI and five runs scored. Boston manager Alex Cora became the first Puerto Rican to lead a team to the World Series, as well as the second Latino manager to do it in the Series. The Venezuelan Ozzie Guillén became the first when he led the Chicago White Sox to the title in 2005. With their victory in the World Series, the Red Sox secured their ninth championship title, tying the Philadelphia/Oakland Athletics franchise for the third most in MLB history behind the New York Yankees (27) and St. Louis Cardinals (11). But the Red Sox have come on strong in recent years, winning four titles in a span of 15 seasons from 2004 through 2018. As a result, they are the first MLB club to win four World Series titles in the 21st century. \n\nParagraph 44: The theories of Ubaghs are contained in a vast collection of treatises on which he expended the best years of his life. Editions followed one another as the range of his teaching widened. Ubaghs clearly affirmed the fundamental thesis of Traditionalism: the acquisition of metaphysical and moral truths is inexplicable without a primitive Divine teaching and its oral transmission. Social teaching is a natural law, a condition so necessary that without a miracle man could not, except through it, attain the explicit knowledge of truths of a metaphysical and a moral order. Teaching and language are not merely a psychological medium which favours the acquisition of these truths; their action is determinant. Hence the primordial act of man is an act of faith; the authority of others becomes the basis of certitude. The question arises: Is our adherence to the fundamental truths of the speculative and moral order blind; and, is the existence of God, which is one of them, impossible of rational demonstration? Ubaghs did not go as far as this; his Traditionalism was mitigated, a semi-Traditionalism; once teaching has awakened ideas in us and transmitted the maxims (ordo acquisitionis) reason is able and apt to comprehend them. Though powerless to discover them it is regarded as being capable of demonstrating them once they have been made known to it. One of his favourite comparisons admirably states the problem: \"As the word 'view' chiefly expresses four things, the faculty of seeing, the act of seeing, the object seen, e.g. a landscape, and the drawing an artist makes of this object, so we give the name idea, which is derived from the former, chiefly to four different things: the faculty of knowing rationally, the act of rational knowledge, the object of this knowledge, the intellectual copy or formula which we make of this object in conceiving it\" (Psychologie, 5th ed., 1857, 41–42). Now, the objective idea, or object-idea (third acceptation), in other words, the intelligible which we contemplate, and contact with which produces within us the intellectual formula (notion), is \"something Divine\" or, rather, it is God himself. This is the core of ontologism. The intelligence contemplates God directly and beholds in Him the truths or \"objective ideas\" of which our knowledge is a weak reflection. Assuredly, if Ubaghs is right, skepticism is definitively overcome. Likewise if teaching plays in the physical life the part he assigns to it, the same is true of every doctrine which asserts the original independence of reason and which Ubaghs calls rationalism. But this so-called triumph was purchased at the cost of many errors. It is, to say the least, strange that on the one hand Traditionalist Ontologism is based on a distrust of reason, and on the other hand it endows reason with unjustifiable prerogatives. Surely it is an incredible audacity to set man face to face with the Divine essence and to attribute to his weak mind the immediate perception of the eternal and immutable verities.\n\nParagraph 45: Bryan Durham of The Times of India gave the album 4 out of 5 and summarized, \"In totality, it also needs to be said that if Rahman's music is the language of this film, it would be quite short on a vocabulary without Irshad Kamil's beautiful lyrics.\" Jyoti Prakash of Indian Box Office Online also gave it 4.5 out of 5 stars and said, \"The music of Raanjhanaa is of supreme quality. A typical AR Rahman album which is romantic and entertaining yet pure and divine.\" Music Aloud critic Vipin assigned the soundtrack 8 out of 10 and noted, \"A mixed bag from ARR that is more urbane than folk-classical.\" Kaushik Ramesh of Planet Bollywood gave the album 7/10. Calling it very experimental, he said, \"Be it the innovative vocal shehnai of 'Ay Sakhi' or Rabbi's attitude laden 'Tu Mun Shudi', the entire album presents immense freshness.\" Rumnique Nannar of Bollyspice gave the album 4.5/5 stars and wrote, \"Raanjhanaa is a brilliant return to form and originality for A. R. Rahman, who proves his detractors wrong with an album that captures the energy of its city and its lovestruck Raanjhana. The songs may just take time to grow on the listener, but that's the joy in it, to savour all of the arrangements and voices that add up to a terrific and rustic album for the ages.\" Sakhayan Ghosh of The Indian Express summarized, \"Irshad Kamil's lyrics provide a perfect foil to the music. And this is Rahman's finest turn since Rockstar, seeing the maestro enter exciting new musical territories.\" He gave the album 4 out of 5. Joginder Tuteja at Movie Talkies claimed, \"There were good expectations from the music of Raanjhanaa and they are pretty much met (and at places even exceeded) with A. R. Rahman, Irshad Kamil and their singers coming together well to meet the shared vision that was spearheaded by the makers.\" He gave the album 3.5 out of 5 and added that the music \"works quite well as a packaged affair\". IANS gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars and observed, \"Like any other album, the music of Raanjhanaa has few low points, but otherwise it is thoroughly entertaining.\" At Koimoi, critic Manohar Basu rated the album 3 on 5 and noted, \"Very unlikely to be a Rahman composition, the music yet again lacks a soul stirring capability which made him a maverick once! Technically it is both brilliant and fine but the midas touch of the musician is strikingly missing.\" The critics review board at Behindwoods called it a \"joyous wonder from Rahman\" and gave it 3.5 out of 5.\n\nParagraph 46: At the beginning of the 1980s the Toledo Zoo faced a potential closure. With an agreement created by Jones, the zoo was financially tied to a city in a financial crisis.  Massive layoffs ensued and a staff of 70 was reduced to 24. With a passage of a zoo levy in November 1980, they were still left in the face of probable closure. The levy was for capital improvements only, so the money could not be used on animal care, staff members, or other items needed to run the zoo. As a result, the Museum of Science and the conservatory were closed.  To add to the problems, Skeldon was set to retire at the end of the year, and they had not yet found a replacement director. In January 1981, William \"Bill\" Dennler accepted the position and became the director of the Toledo Zoo. A proposal for payroll increase was denied and by the end of 1981, the Toledo Zoo only had 15 full-time employees.  With the support of the board members, staff, donors, and citizens, the zoo was able to raise enough money to keep their doors open. At the same time, a study by the Toledo Area Governmental Research Association reported that the zoo should become a private, non-profit organization.  Taking this advice on April 1, 1982, the Toledo Zoo was removed from the Board of Members that was created and handed exclusively to be operated and funded by the Toledo Zoological Society.  The TZS also worked with the Ohio Legislature which allowed them to work on the county level, and be able to add levies to the Lucas County Ballots to help finance the zoo's needs. With these changes taking place, the Toledo Zoo was starting a revival. By 1982, the Greenhouse/Conservatory had been renovated and reopened to the public and the Museum of Science was back in operation. The WPA buildings were carefully restored, and in 1983 a children's zoo was opened. The Aquarium had two major incidents occur during the 1980s. In 1982, the Aquarium caught fire, killing 104 fish as well as destroying much of the building. Later in 1987, a tank had cracked sending 20 tons of water rushing out. Toledo Zoo broke ground on their African Savanna exhibit, which included the first ever Hippoquarium in 1986, and the rest of the savanna opening from 1987 to 1989. Because of the success of the Hippoquarium exhibit and a hippo birth caught on tape, the Toledo Zoo was given an opportunity to exhibit two giant pandas on loan from the People's Republic of China. The panda pair arrived in May 1988 and were exhibited through October 1988. This was the first year that the zoo had over a million people attend in one year. The loan was challenged by the World Wildlife Fund, as well as the American Zoo and Aquarium Association, through a lawsuit against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service. Additional lawsuits followed, but the loan of the pandas remained intact and the lawsuits were settled. This outcry of debate dissolved the relationship with the People's Republic of China, and it was not until 1998 that they allowed another loan of pandas to the US, via the San Diego Zoo. In 1994 the zoo again exceed 1 million visitors with their exhibit DinoRoars!, and again in 1998 with the reopening of the Aviary as well as the introduction of the primate forest. During their regrowth they also created a children's park, a pavilion for events, a catering department, an Emmy Award-winning show called Zoo Today, and re-purposed many of the WPA era buildings. The Carnivora was relaunched as the Carnivore Cafe in 1993, they re-purposed the original Rare Mammal Building into the Kingdom of the Apes, altered the Elephant House to be an events center, and expanded their land across the Anthony Wayne Trail to their now Northern Campus.  In 1997, to connect the two parts of the zoo, the Toledo Zoo erected a pedestrian bridge. The Northern Campus which had previously been parking area opened the Arctic Encounter Exhibit in 2000.\n\nPlease enter the final count of unique paragraphs after removing duplicates.

Percussionist Chris Steffler and guitarist Sergio Galli answered the ad. Steffler (b. 1958/1959) grew-up in Wasaga Beach, where his parents owned a trailer park and campground, and where Steffler played drums for local bands before moving to Toronto in 1978. Galli (b. 1959/1960) was enrolled in the architecture program at the University of Toronto when he answered Holmes' ad. The band recorded a seven track demo tape on a four-track recorder and sent it to British music producer David Tickle who liked their sound and flew to Toronto to work with them. The band signed to Epic Records Canada and Tickle produced their self-titled EP, which was released in 1983. Tickle also produced their debut, full-length album Standing in the Dark, which expanded upon the tracks from their EP and was released later that same year. Standing in the Dark sold over 200,000 copies in Canada, which was certified double platinum at the time. The band's videos for the singles \"Standing in the Dark\" and \"Doesn't Really Matter\" were directed by Rob Quartly and were both nominated for video of the year at the 1984 Juno Awards. The Canadian music cable network MuchMusic (later known as Much) also launched in 1984, further exposing their music to a wider audience.\n\nParagraph 2: The first articles in the Romanian Wikipedia were written in July 2003, with the first version of the main page being drafted on 12 July. The user interface, initially in English, started being translated into Romanian by Bogdan Stăncescu (registered with the username Gutza) as soon as he was given sysop rights. The same user subsequently contacted several Romanian universities that were available on the internet, as well as the Romanian Academy, in order to attract new contributors. His efforts were soon remarked by the Romanian media, who invited him on several occasions to introduce the project to the public. By the end of 2003, the Romanian Wikipedia had exceeded 3,000 articles, ranking 16th among all Wikipedias. The 10,000th article was written on 13 December 2004, and the 50,000th on 5 January 2007.\n\nParagraph 3: In February 2009, Jimmy and Nicola De Souza (Nicola Wheeler) drowned their sorrows together and ended up in the back of an Emmerdale Haulage van, waking up the next morning naked and on their way to Hull. Nicola was horrified; Jimmy was amused. Nicola felt she was too good for Jimmy and refused to consider a relationship. A few weeks later, she asked him to go with her to Home Farm but Jimmy was uncomfortable and got drunk before spending the night with Nicola again.  She dumped him again but when Rodney suggested Jimmy might have some money in Switzerland (where he was going on a business trip), Nicola was suddenly interested. Carl told Jimmy that Nicola was only interested in his money and when Nicola proved Carl right, Jimmy humiliated her by wining and dining her before telling everyone that she was a gold digger and left her at the roadside. Sandy Thomas (Freddie Jones) and Douglas Potts (Duncan Preston), who lived with Nicola, grew so tired of her that they wrote love letters in Jimmy's name, asking her to move in with him. Nicola jumped at the chance of living with him and Jimmy was thrilled. He was shocked to hear about the letters but kept quiet. The truth came out when Betty Eagleton (Paula Tilbrook) read out a similar letter from Sandy. Jimmy admitted that he hadn't written the letter but Nicola demanded he write her a love letter, despite him insisting that he wasn't very good at it. He was proved right and after another argument caused by Jimmy telling Nicola she was curvaceous, which she interpreted as fat, he ended it and Lexi Nicholls (Sally Oliver) insisted that she move out, persuading Laurel Thomas (Charlotte Bellamy) to let Nicola move back into the vicarage. In May 2009, Nicola discovered she was pregnant but didn't tell Jimmy so Rodney did and Jimmy wooed her into a reconciliation, planning to let her tell him about the baby when she was ready. When Nicola found out, she was furious and dumped him again and considered giving the baby up for adoption but Laurel convinced her not to. Jimmy and Nicola bonded when they went for a scan and they decided to give things another go. Nicola returned to Mill Cottage and supported Lexi after her ectopic pregnancy and shock discovery that she was unlikely to conceive again. Scarlett offered to pay for their IVF but Carl told Jimmy (as Scarlett's trustee), not to release the money as he didn't want any more children. Horrified, Nicola insisted Carl tell Lexi. He did and she threw him out, leaving Nicola to comfort her but this led to a fight and Nicola fell down the stairs. Lexi called an ambulance and Nicola and the baby got the all-clear but Nicola blamed Carl for the fight and told him so, warning him to be honest with Lexi. On 6 August, Nicola gave birth prematurely to baby Angelica, who spent a few days in the special care unit. On the 13th, Nicola went for a shower and Lexi took Angelica up to the roof to show her the world. Although Jimmy, Nicola and Scarlett were terrified she'd harm Angelica, Lexi convinced Nicola to trust her and Carl finally admitted that he didn't want any more children and never had. She returned Angelica to Nicola and after a verbal and physical fight with Carl, she left him and Emmerdale for good.\n\nParagraph 4: Soups, often featuring egg noodles, are characteristic of the Pennsylvania Dutch. Pennsylvanian Dutch homes have traditionally had many broths on hand (vegetable, fish, poultry, and other meats) from the saving of any extra liquids available: \"The Pennsylvania Dutch developed soup making to such a high art that complete cookbooks could be written about their soups alone; there was an appropriate soup for every day of the year, including a variety of hot and cold fruit soups.\" Soups were traditionally divided into different categories, including Sippli or \"little soup\" (a light broth), Koppsupper or \"cup soups\", Suppe (thick, chowder soups, often served as a meal with bread), and G'schmorte (a soup with no broth, often like a Brieh (Brei) or gravy).\n\nParagraph 5: While most scholars such as Kenneth Kitchen have equated Manetho's Tefnakht with the king Shepsesre Tefnakht of Sais who is attested by the Year 8 Athens donation stela, a recent article by Olivier Perdu has suggested that this Tefnakht was rather Tefnakht II, a much later king of Sais who ruled in the mid-680's BCE during the late Nubian 25th Dynasty. In his paper, Perdu published a newly discovered stela dating from the second year of Necho I's reign, which he contends is similar in style, text and content to the Year 8 stela of Shepsesre Tefnakht. Perdu, thus, infers that these two kings of Sais—Necho I and Tefnakht II—were close contemporaries. However, his arguments are not currently accepted by most Egyptian scholars such as Dan'el Kahn or Kenneth Kitchen who still believe that the Year 8 Athens stela of king Shepsesre Tefnakht likely belongs to Tefnakht I rather than a hypothetical Tefnakht II who would then have assumed power in 685 BC at Sais—early during the reign of Taharqa, one of the most powerful Nubian rulers of Egypt. Kahn has also stressed at an Egyptological Conference at Leiden that Perdu's epigraphic criteria here in the famed Athens stela—such as the use of the tripartite wig, the method through which the falcon-headed god keeps his head upright in the same stela and on temple wall reliefs contemporary with Tefnakht I's time, the decoration of the stela scene: Heaven supported by wAs scepters—appear already in use in the 24th or early 25th Nubian dynasty during Piye, Shabaka or Bakenranef's reign. The invisible back side of the tripartite wig can be found on the donation stela of Shebitku from Pharbaitos and on the Bakenranef/Bocchoris vase dating to the last days of Piye and the beginning of Shabaka—all appear close in time to the presumed reign of Tefnakht I. Moreover, the head of the falcon-headed god Horus is, as Perdu himself noted, similar in style to the stela of Tefnakht, chief of the Meshwesh and Piye's chief rival.\n\nParagraph 6: Smith continued to run his painting business, which employed 250 by 1965. In 1962, he established a public relations firm to support redevelopment of other urban centres in the north-east, and later nationwide. This company formed links with John Poulson, an architect keen for the business and known for paying those who could supply it. Smith eventually received £156,000 from Poulson for his work, which typically involved signing up local councillors on to the payroll of his companies and getting them to push their councils to accept Poulson's prepackaged redevelopment schemes. Poulson earned more than £1,000,000 through Smith, who regarded him as the \"best architect Britain ever produced.\" Poulson did not design any buildings in Newcastle, and there is no evidence of corruption during Smith's time as head of Newcastle's council.\n\nParagraph 7: In 2001, Phil gets shot by an unseen assailant and Jamie resolves to take care of his business empire until he recovers. Jamie later suspects that one of Phil's two archenemies, Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) and Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass), is the culprit when he becomes involved in their dangerous feud – up to the point where Dan begins to extort money from Jamie in his revenge against Phil, while Steve begins clashing with Jamie over the escalating situation. Billy, who is working for Steve as his errand boy, learns about Jamie's struggle and taunts him about it until Jamie overpowers Billy in the snooker club and forces him to submit. Moreover, Jamie ends up sharing his theory with Steve's wife and Dan's former girlfriend Mel Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite). By the time Phil has recovered, it is revealed that the shooter was in fact his ex-girlfriend and Mel's best-friend Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin). He doesn't tell Jamie about this, however, and the two resolve to implicate Dan and Steve behind the shooting in order to rid them out of the square for good. Phil sets his plan to frame Dan as the shooter and Steve as an accessory in motion when he contacts Dan's former crime boss, Ritchie Stringer (Gareth Hunt), and lends him Steve's handgun that Lisa used to shoot him; Ritchie later gives Dan the gun under the pretense of being permitted to further extort Phil. Later on that night, Dan threatens Phil at gunpoint and Jamie intervenes when he suspects that something has gone wrong. Dan nearly shoots them until the police arrive and arrest him for shooting Phil. Afterwards, Phil summons his lawyer Marcus Christie (Stephen Churchett) and the two advice Jamie to testify against Dan to ensure he gets sent down. Jamie complies and Phil later entraps Steve into conspiring with him against Dan to rid themselves of their common enemy. However, their plan fails when Dan is found not guilty and he gets revenge on Phil by kidnapping Mel for a £200,000 ransom – with Dan also getting revenge on Steve for conspiring with Phil against him and using Mel as leverage to exact his vengeance.\n\nParagraph 8: In 1982, Holmes placed a want ad in a Toronto newspaper looking for new musicians to join the band. Percussionist Chris Steffler and guitarist Sergio Galli answered the ad. Steffler (b. 1958/1959) grew-up in Wasaga Beach, where his parents owned a trailer park and campground, and where Steffler played drums for local bands before moving to Toronto in 1978.

More specifically, the IDE includes a GUI designer, code/design views, syntax highlighting, auto completion menus (similar to IntelliSense) the ability to compile and debug form/console .NET Framework applications, a \"New Project\" wizard, toolbars, menus, panels and a docking system, and built-in code refactoring tools, and it has an integrated debugger that allows for stepping, viewing values of objects in memory, and breakpoints.\n\nParagraph 10: In 1899 his lectures had been extended to include Marconi's system. The successful experiments by Walker in Sydney in August 1899 prompted Jenvey to reveal that for some weeks he had been exchanging messages between the General Post Office and the Telephone exchange at Willis Street, a distance of a half mile. The first message to grace the airwaves of Melbourne was \"Long reign Duffy\" referring to the then Postmaster-General for Victoria. By 1900 he was reporting that an experimental network of wireless stations had been established at the Observatory, Wilson Hall at the University and the General Post Office. As part of the Congress of the Association for the Advancement of Science, on 12 January 1900, Jenvey presented a lecture on the current state of wireless telegraphy in the world at the Wilson Hall of the University of Melbourne. At the conclusion of the lecture, he then sent a request from his station erected in the hall and received in return the word \"Melbourne\" from his station in the tower of the General Post Office. Jenvey continued his experiments throughout 1900, with regular stations established at Heidelberg and Doncaster. From April 1901, efforts concentrated on Point Ormond, Port Phillip Bay and a station was established with a 155 ft. pole near the shoreline, to take advantage of the better propagation over salt water. From Point Ormond, communication was soon established with Point Cook, a distance of 10 miles, by means of a kite-borne aerial at the latter location. The timing of this extension of transmission distance for Jenvey's apparatus was sublime. The Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York were to visit Australia to participate in the celebrations of Federation. Jenvey sought and obtained permission from Senator Drake, the Postmaster-General, to erect a facility at Queenscliff to send greetings to the royal party as they approached Port Phillip Bay. In the first week of May, a large tent was erected on the recreation reserve near the fort and the equipment installed. On Sunday evening 5 May 1901, news was received at Queenscliff that the R.M.S. Ophir was off Split Point and the message of greeting was sent. No reply was received, but it was later confirmed that the message was received by the escorting ships, but the absence of a Naval code precluded a response. While the convoy was in port, Jenvey established contact with Lieutenant Trousdale, R.N., of the warship  and messages were then regularly exchanged with the Point Ormond station. When most of the convoy departed on 18 May, Jenvey exchanged messages with the St. George on the initial part of her journey. The last message received from the St. George was at a distance of 37 miles, a record for Australia which would stand for some years. He continued his experiments throughout the 1900s, but prioritised the essential work of developing and integrating the telegraphic and telephonic networks of the fledgling Commonwealth.\n\nParagraph 11: In 1982, Holmes placed a want ad in a Toronto newspaper looking for new musicians to join the band. Percussionist Chris Steffler and guitarist Sergio Galli answered the ad. Steffler (b. 1958/1959) grew-up in Wasaga Beach, where his parents owned a trailer park and campground, and where Steffler played drums for local bands before moving to Toronto in 1978. Galli (b. 1959/1960) was enrolled in the architecture program at the University of Toronto when he answered Holmes' ad. The band recorded a seven track demo tape on a four-track recorder and sent it to British music producer David Tickle who liked their sound and flew to Toronto to work with them. The band signed to Epic Records Canada and Tickle produced their self-titled EP, which was released in 1983. Tickle also produced their debut, full-length album Standing in the Dark, which expanded upon the tracks from their EP and was released later that same year. Standing in the Dark sold over 200,000 copies in Canada, which was certified double platinum at the time. The band's videos for the singles \"Standing in the Dark\" and \"Doesn't Really Matter\" were directed by Rob Quartly and were both nominated for video of the year at the 1984 Juno Awards. The Canadian music cable network MuchMusic (later known as Much) also launched in 1984, further exposing their music to a wider audience.\n\nParagraph 12: In September 1985, Hogue, now 25 years old, stole the identity of a deceased infant and enrolled as a student at Palo Alto High School as Jay Mitchell Huntsman, a 16-year-old orphan from Nevada. On October 7, 1985, Hogue entered the Stanford Invitational Cross Country Meet. Hogue ran far ahead of the field and won the race, but did not report to the officials' table, arousing suspicion. Due to his mysterious background and physical prowess, local sports reporters dubbed him the \"Mystery Boy\". Jason Cole, a reporter covering the event for the now-defunct Peninsula Times Tribune, uncovered Hogue's identity theft, and Hogue left town.\n\nParagraph 13: After obtaining his doctorate, Heimsoth worked at practices in the Gynecologic University Clinic of Kiel.  At the same time, he became an \"activist of the first homosexual emancipation movement\", but distanced himself from the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee that had formed around Magnus Hirschfeld, because he considered that the theories advocated by the Committee concerning the \"third sex\" were wrong, and based on a reflex or proxy for the heteronormative assumption that sexual attraction is possible only as a function of polar opposites,  even when such polar opposites are embodied within one individual as in the 'third sex'. Theories regarding the 'third sex' from which he chose to distance himself, are ultimately based on the idea that the polarity represented by heterosexuality must be universal, and as such even homosexual individuals and the homosexual orientation itself mus reproduce or emulate that polarity. Heimsoth's theory on the other hand does not rely on heterosexuality to explain homosexuality. Instead it takes homosexuality as it is, as an attraction to the same sex, without any reference to a polarity real or imagined. In his writing Freundesliebe oder Homosexualität (\"Love Between Friends or Homosexuality\"), published in the magazine Der Eigene by Adolf Brand in 1925, Heimsoth showed his antisemitism: \"All heroic and masculine love between friends\" remains, \"in his idea and possibilities of understanding[,] foreign to the Jewish spirit\". Male homosexuality is thus envisioned as not only heroic, but purely masculine, not only in terms of its object of attraction but also in the sexual identity and being of the man in question. In this understanding it is the masculine within the homosexual male that seeks out the same masculinity in other males as sexually attractive without any reference to an assumed internal feminine.   Heimsoth's ideal was that of a whole man, virile and Aryan.  Homoerotic friendships between men were to serve as a nexus of \"obersten Machtaufgebot\" (called higher power).  Heimsoth thought that he could find examples of such heroes among the soldiers of World War I and among the Freikorps environment, as can be gathered from his 1925 publication in the magazine Der Eigene: in it he asked to be sent documentation to demonstrate the \"circumstances and homoerotic relations in the Kampfwagen formations and secret societies\" and wanted to obtain material \"about heroism, the heroic leader problem and the psyche of the volunteers, the desperate, Landsknechte, Freikorps members, and secret societies\".\n\nParagraph 14: In the mid-1940s, Ed Dodd was employed in advertising. Dodd and Jack Elrod met when they were with the Boy Scouts; Dodd was a Scout leader and Elrod was a Scout. In 1946, after Dodd sold Mark Trail to a syndicate, the strip was launched on April 15 in the New York Post. In 1950, Dodd hired Elrod to work as the strip's background artist and letterer. During the late 1940s, the cartoonist Jack Davis worked one summer inking Mark Trail, which he later parodied in Mad as \"Mark Trade.\" In addition to Davis and Elrod, Dodd also hired Tom Hill, Barbara Chen (who did the lettering) and secretary Rhett Carmichael. The strip's popularity grew through the mid-1960s, with Mark Trail appearing in nearly 500 newspapers through the North America Syndicate.\n\nParagraph 15: In 1899 his lectures had been extended to include Marconi's system. The successful experiments by Walker in Sydney in August 1899 prompted Jenvey to reveal that for some weeks he had been exchanging messages between the General Post Office and the Telephone exchange at Willis Street, a distance of a half mile. The first message to grace the airwaves of Melbourne was \"Long reign Duffy\" referring to the then Postmaster-General for Victoria. By 1900 he was reporting that an experimental network of wireless stations had been established at the Observatory, Wilson Hall at the University and the General Post Office. As part of the Congress of the Association for the Advancement of Science, on 12 January 1900, Jenvey presented a lecture on the current state of wireless telegraphy in the world at the Wilson Hall of the University of Melbourne. At the conclusion of the lecture, he then sent a request from his station erected in the hall and received in return the word \"Melbourne\" from his station in the tower of the General Post Office. Jenvey continued his experiments throughout 1900, with regular stations established at Heidelberg and Doncaster. From April 1901, efforts concentrated on Point Ormond, Port Phillip Bay and a station was established with a 155 ft. pole near the shoreline, to take advantage of the better propagation over salt water. From Point Ormond, communication was soon established with Point Cook, a distance of 10 miles, by means of a kite-borne aerial at the latter location. The timing of this extension of transmission distance for Jenvey's apparatus was sublime. The Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York were to visit Australia to participate in the celebrations of Federation. Jenvey sought and obtained permission from Senator Drake, the Postmaster-General, to erect a facility at Queenscliff to send greetings to the royal party as they approached Port Phillip Bay.

The song had been recorded twice before by Lennon, prior to the Let It Be sessions. The first occurred in early December 1968 at Lennon's Kenwood estate on a portable cassette tape. For this, the lyric was \"Everyone had a hard year\" instead of the later \"Everybody\". Later in December 1968, with the lyric changed to \"everybody,\" Lennon was filmed performing the song in the back garden of Kenwood. This footage was used in the Yoko Ono art film Rape: Film No. 6, which was broadcast on Austrian television on 31 March 1969.\n\nParagraph 17: Smith continued to run his painting business, which employed 250 by 1965. In 1962, he established a public relations firm to support redevelopment of other urban centres in the north-east, and later nationwide. This company formed links with John Poulson, an architect keen for the business and known for paying those who could supply it. Smith eventually received £156,000 from Poulson for his work, which typically involved signing up local councillors on to the payroll of his companies and getting them to push their councils to accept Poulson's prepackaged redevelopment schemes. Poulson earned more than £1,000,000 through Smith, who regarded him as the \"best architect Britain ever produced.\" Poulson did not design any buildings in Newcastle, and there is no evidence of corruption during Smith's time as head of Newcastle's council.\n\nParagraph 18: McGinley was raised in Rathfarnham and was educated at St Mary's BNS and Coláiste Éanna. His father Mick — who is from Dunfanaghy — played Gaelic football for Donegal, while his mother Julia comes from Rathmullan. McGinley himself was born in Dublin and studied at Dublin Institute of Technology. After his knee injury McGinley turned his full attention to golf. McGinley later said that when he played golf as part of a team it helped to raise his game to another level. He credited his experience of Gaelic football for his passion for team sports and suggested it played a part in why he was appointed European captain for the 2014 Ryder Cup.\n\nParagraph 19: In September 1985, Hogue, now 25 years old, stole the identity of a deceased infant and enrolled as a student at Palo Alto High School as Jay Mitchell Huntsman, a 16-year-old orphan from Nevada.

The boys soccer team won the Group II championship in 1946-1950, 1991 (co-champion with Cinnaminson High School), 2001 (vs. Northern Burlington County Regional High School), 2002 (vs. Hopewell Valley Central High School) and 2003 (co-champion with Delran High School); Group I in 1953-1955, 1958-1960, 1966 (co-champion with Jamesburg High School), 1968 (co-champion with Chatham High School), 1970 (co-champion with Chatham), 1972 (co-champion with Jamesburg), 1975 (vs. Riverside High School), 1976 (co-champion with Riverside), 2006 (vs. Metuchen High School), 2007 (vs. Arthur P. Schalick High School), 2008 (vs. South River High School) and 2014 (vs. Haddon Township High School). The team has won a total of 25 state championships, tied for the most in the state; this total includes titles awarded to the team in 1946-1950, 1954, 1955, 1958 and 1959, prior to the playoff era. The 15 state titles won via playoffs are the second most of any school in the state, The 1966 team finished the season at 12-1-4 after the Group I championship game with Jamesburg ended in a 1–1 tie. The 1972 team finished the season with 13-2-4 record after being declared as the Group I co-champion with Jamesburg following a 1–1 tie after double overtime in the tournament final played at Fairleigh Dickinson University. The 1991 team finished the season with an 18-4-2 after the Group II championship game with Cinnaminson ended in a 0-0 time, marking the program's sixth state championship, five of them as co-champions. The team won the 2006 North II, Group I state sectional championship with a 2-1 win against Glen Ridge High School, then won the Group I state championship with a 2-0 win over Waldwick High School in the semifinals and a 6-0 win against Metuchen in the finals. The 2007 team repeated as North II, Group I state sectional championship with a 3-1 win over Jonathan Dayton High School in the tournament final. The 2007 team won the Group I state championship with a 2-1 win over Arthur P. Schalick High School, the team's 23rd state championship, finishing the season with an 18–5–2 record. The 2008 team won the Group I state championship with a 2-1 win over South River High School. The team finished the season 22-1-1 record and won the 2013 North II, Group II state sectional championship with a 4-0 victory against Leonia High School also winning the Hudson County Tournament against Memorial High School by a score of 2-0. The team finished the season with a 24–3 record and won the program's 25th state title in 2014 with a 4-0 victory against Haddon Township in the Group I final at Kean University. The team finished the season 20-4 record and won the 2016 North II, Group II state sectional championship with a 2-2 penalty shootout victory against Dover High School. The Blue tides won their league division in 2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2019,2021,2022\n\nParagraph 21: McGinley was raised in Rathfarnham and was educated at St Mary's BNS and Coláiste Éanna.

On 5 September, Nur Mohammad was patrolling with 4 fellow soldiers. The Pakistan army attacked them from three different sides. Nur Mohammad tried to retreat to his base while still engaging the Pakistani troops. Meanwhile, one of his fellow soldiers, Nannu Mia, was injured after a bullet hit him. Nur Mohammad tried to carry Nannu Mia towards safety while trying to fire his gun from different places as a trick to confuse the Pakistani troops into believing that there were more than four Bangladeshi rebels. In doing so, Nur Mohammad himself was hit by a mortar and his foot was destroyed. Even though he was seriously injured, Nur Mohammad decided to continue to provide cover fire for his team to escape. At the time, his fellow Sepoy Mostafa urged Nur Mohammad to go with him. Mostafa even tried to force Nur Mohammad to go but Nur Mohammad refused to go and gave his light machine gun to Mostafa so that it would not be captured after his death. He kept a self loaded rifle with him and kept on fighting until he died.\n\nParagraph 25: In 1899 his lectures had been extended to include Marconi's system.

The timing of this extension of transmission distance for Jenvey's apparatus was sublime. The Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York were to visit Australia to participate in the celebrations of Federation. Jenvey sought and obtained permission from Senator Drake, the Postmaster-General, to erect a facility at Queenscliff to send greetings to the royal party as they approached Port Phillip Bay. In the first week of May, a large tent was erected on the recreation reserve near the fort and the equipment installed. On Sunday evening 5 May 1901, news was received at Queenscliff that the R.M.S. Ophir was off Split Point and the message of greeting was sent. No reply was received, but it was later confirmed that the message was received by the escorting ships, but the absence of a Naval code precluded a response.

He continued his experiments throughout the 1900s, but prioritised the essential work of developing and integrating the telegraphic and telephonic networks of the fledgling Commonwealth.\n\nParagraph 26: Muhammad died in 632 and the first successors, called Caliphs – Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman ibn al-Affan, Ali ibn Abi Talib and sometimes Hasan ibn Ali – are known in Sunni Islam as al-khulafā' ar-rāshidūn (\"Rightly Guided Caliphs\"). Some tribes left Islam and rebelled under leaders who declared themselves new prophets but were crushed by Abu Bakr in the Ridda wars. Local populations of Jews and indigenous Christians, persecuted as religious minorities and heretics and taxed heavily, often helped Muslims take over their lands, resulting in rapid expansion of the caliphate into the Persian and Byzantine empires. Uthman was elected in 644 and his assassination by rebels led to Ali being elected the next Caliph. In the First Civil War, Muhammad's widow, Aisha, raised an army against Ali, asking to avenge the death of Uthman, but was defeated at the Battle of the Camel. Ali attempted to remove the governor of Syria, Mu'awiya, who was seen as corrupt. Mu'awiya then declared war on Ali and was defeated in the Battle of Siffin. Ali's decision to arbitrate angered the Kharijites, an extremist sect, who felt that by not fighting a sinner, Ali became a sinner as well.  The Kharijites rebelled and were defeated in the Battle of Nahrawan but a Kharijite assassin later killed Ali. Ali's son, Hasan ibn Ali, was elected Caliph and signed a peace treaty to avoid further fighting, abdicating to Mu'awiya in return for Mu'awiya not appointing a successor. Mu'awiya began the Umayyad dynasty with the appointment of his son Yazid I as successor, sparking the Second Civil War. During the Battle of Karbala, Husayn ibn Ali was killed by Yazid's forces; the event has been annually commemorated by Shia ever since. Sunnis, led by Ibn al-Zubayr, opposed to a dynastic caliphate were defeated in the siege of Mecca. These disputes over leadership would give rise to the Sunni-Shia schism, with the Shia believing leadership belongs to Muhammad's family through Ali, called the ahl al-bayt.\n\nParagraph 27: In 2004, it established a joint venture with DuPont to manufacture a renewable 1,3-Propanediol that can be used to make Sorona (a substitute for nylon). This was its first major foray into bio-materials. In 2005, DuPont Tate & Lyle BioProducts was created as a joint venture between DuPont and Tate & Lyle. In 2006, it acquired Hycail, a small Dutch business, giving the company intellectual property and a pilot plant to manufacture Polylactic acid (PLA), another bio-plastic. In October 2007, five European starch and alcohol plants, previously part of the European starch division known as Amylum group, were sold to Syral, a subsidiary of French sugar company Tereos. Syral closed its Greenwich Peninsula plant in London in September 2009, and it was subsequently demolished.\n\nParagraph 28: Soups, often featuring egg noodles, are characteristic of the Pennsylvania Dutch. Pennsylvanian Dutch homes have traditionally had many broths on hand (vegetable, fish, poultry, and other meats) from the saving of any extra liquids available: \"The Pennsylvania Dutch developed soup making to such a high art that complete cookbooks could be written about their soups alone; there was an appropriate soup for every day of the year, including a variety of hot and cold fruit soups.\" Soups were traditionally divided into different categories, including Sippli or \"little soup\" (a light broth), Koppsupper or \"cup soups\", Suppe (thick, chowder soups, often served as a meal with bread), and G'schmorte (a soup with no broth, often like a Brieh (Brei) or gravy).\n\nParagraph 29: In September 1985, Hogue, now 25 years old, stole the identity of a deceased infant and enrolled as a student at Palo Alto High School as Jay Mitchell Huntsman, a 16-year-old orphan from Nevada. On October 7, 1985, Hogue entered the Stanford Invitational Cross Country Meet. Hogue ran far ahead of the field and won the race, but did not report to the officials' table, arousing suspicion. Due to his mysterious background and physical prowess, local sports reporters dubbed him the \"Mystery Boy\". Jason Cole, a reporter covering the event for the now-defunct Peninsula Times Tribune, uncovered Hogue's identity theft, and Hogue left town.\n\nParagraph 30: McGinley was raised in Rathfarnham and was educated at St Mary's BNS and Coláiste Éanna.

The same night, Zach appears at the Bait Shop for a drink. While there, he asks Alex for advice on Summer, oblivious to the fact that Alex actually knows Seth and Summer. She advises him to fight for Summer, otherwise she'll never fall for him. At the end of the conversation, she realizes that Zach is talking about Seth and Summer's relationship, and seems to contemplate making a move of her own. Alex shows up at the dance, and takes care of Seth after Zach punches him, and they end up sharing a kiss at the Bait Shop where they've gone to get a first aid kit. As their relationship has progressed, Seth keeps trying to impress her by being a \"bad boy\" by getting drunk and stealing Caleb's car. Upon realizing what Seth is doing Alex tells him that she's been with a lot of bad boys, and that he's just not one of them. She then proceeds to tell him that she likes him because he's a good guy. When Sandy, Seth's dad, shows up at the Bait Shop he asks her to tell Seth that they cannot see each other because Seth will not listen to him, as Sandy thinks Alex is a bad influence on Seth. When Seth ends up coming by the Bait Shop after sneaking out she tells him that his dad came by for a visit, and that she needs to do the right thing and not see him for a while. This doesn't last long as Alex then helps Seth and Sandy throw a surprise anniversary party for Kirsten, and they then approve of her. The good doesn't last long though; when Alex's ex-girlfriend, Jody, shows up in town it causes a strain between Seth and her and they decide to break up, and she apologizes for the incident.\n\nParagraph 32: In 1899 his lectures had been extended to include Marconi's system.

From the rivers and streams to the aerospace industry, Alabama's transportation is constantly growing and evolving. In the early periods of time, water transport was the most substantial means of travel. Water transportation in Alabama began with steamboats, with the first steamboat being the Alabama that was launched in 1818 on the Alabama River. A couple years after the launch of the first steamboat, Alabama began the development of railroad transportation. Railroads solved an abundance of transportation problems and formed opportunities for businessmen. Alabama's first railroad, the Tuscumbia Railway, opened in 1832 in Franklin County. Railroads began to connect Alabama to the rest of the country. In addition, railroads played a major part in the agriculture, politics, and businesses of Alabama. Following the development of railroads, in the beginning of the twentieth century, the Good Roads Movement was organized in efforts to advance modern roads and to persuade the government to further fund the construction and maintenance of the roads. In the early 1900s, the Good Roads movement brought about change in the Alabama state law, which allowed for the production of state highways. This even went a long way in to the 1920s, where the first of many long-distance highways were created in Alabama. Although building the modern roads seemed to bring a rise in the efficiency of transportation, there were some downfalls to building these roads. A big downfall to the production of roads was the high level of maintenance that they required, such as cutting trees, pulling stumps, leveling, and shoveling eroded dirt. In 1898, John H. Bankhead and John Asa Rountree founded the North Alabama Good Roads Association. This organization was focused on improving transportation by having the state highways paid for by the state government and administered by the state highway commission. This was only the beginning of transportation in Alabama. In 1910, aviation in Alabama came into play. Wilbur and Orville Wright formed the very first landing sight in Alabama, which is now known as the Maxwell Air Force Base. During World War I, aviation in Alabama became very popular; there were a good number of Alabamians who joined the war and received flight training. In addition, Alabama's airports played a significant role in World War II, by coordinating the movement of troops and providing training facilities for troops as well as support personnel. Besides water transportation, modern roads, railroads, and aviation, aerospace is Alabama's largest industrial industry. With major sites of the Marshall Space Flight Center and the Redstone Arsenal located in Hunstville, Alabama, Alabama's aerospace industry consists of four sectors: space, defense, aviation, and maintenance, repair, and overhaul. Transportation in Alabama has come a long way from steamboats to rocket ships and transportation continues to develop throughout the years.\n\nParagraph 35: In the mid-1940s, Ed Dodd was employed in advertising. Dodd and Jack Elrod met when they were with the Boy Scouts; Dodd was a Scout leader and Elrod was a Scout. In 1946, after Dodd sold Mark Trail to a syndicate, the strip was launched on April 15 in the New York Post. In 1950, Dodd hired Elrod to work as the strip's background artist and letterer. During the late 1940s, the cartoonist Jack Davis worked one summer inking Mark Trail, which he later parodied in Mad as \"Mark Trade.\" In addition to Davis and Elrod, Dodd also hired Tom Hill, Barbara Chen (who did the lettering) and secretary Rhett Carmichael. The strip's popularity grew through the mid-1960s, with Mark Trail appearing in nearly 500 newspapers through the North America Syndicate.\n\nParagraph 36: In September 1985, Hogue, now 25 years old, stole the identity of a deceased infant and enrolled as a student at Palo Alto High School as Jay Mitchell Huntsman, a 16-year-old orphan from Nevada. On October 7, 1985, Hogue entered the Stanford Invitational Cross Country Meet. Hogue ran far ahead of the field and won the race, but did not report to the officials' table, arousing suspicion. Due to his mysterious background and physical prowess, local sports reporters dubbed him the \"Mystery Boy\". Jason Cole, a reporter covering the event for the now-defunct Peninsula Times Tribune, uncovered Hogue's identity theft, and Hogue left town.\n\nParagraph 37: Muhammad died in 632 and the first successors, called Caliphs – Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman ibn al-Affan, Ali ibn Abi Talib and sometimes Hasan ibn Ali – are known in Sunni Islam as al-khulafā' ar-rāshidūn (\"Rightly Guided Caliphs\"). Some tribes left Islam and rebelled under leaders who declared themselves new prophets but were crushed by Abu Bakr in the Ridda wars. Local populations of Jews and indigenous Christians, persecuted as religious minorities and heretics and taxed heavily, often helped Muslims take over their lands, resulting in rapid expansion of the caliphate into the Persian and Byzantine empires. Uthman was elected in 644 and his assassination by rebels led to Ali being elected the next Caliph. In the First Civil War, Muhammad's widow, Aisha, raised an army against Ali, asking to avenge the death of Uthman, but was defeated at the Battle of the Camel. Ali attempted to remove the governor of Syria, Mu'awiya, who was seen as corrupt. Mu'awiya then declared war on Ali and was defeated in the Battle of Siffin. Ali's decision to arbitrate angered the Kharijites, an extremist sect, who felt that by not fighting a sinner, Ali became a sinner as well.  The Kharijites rebelled and were defeated in the Battle of Nahrawan but a Kharijite assassin later killed Ali. Ali's son, Hasan ibn Ali, was elected Caliph and signed a peace treaty to avoid further fighting, abdicating to Mu'awiya in return for Mu'awiya not appointing a successor. Mu'awiya began the Umayyad dynasty with the appointment of his son Yazid I as successor, sparking the Second Civil War. During the Battle of Karbala, Husayn ibn Ali was killed by Yazid's forces; the event has been annually commemorated by Shia ever since. Sunnis, led by Ibn al-Zubayr, opposed to a dynastic caliphate were defeated in the siege of Mecca. These disputes over leadership would give rise to the Sunni-Shia schism, with the Shia believing leadership belongs to Muhammad's family through Ali, called the ahl al-bayt.\n\nParagraph 38: Alabama's transportation and development play a large part in the history of Alabama. From the rivers and streams to the aerospace industry, Alabama's transportation is constantly growing and evolving. In the early periods of time, water transport was the most substantial means of travel. Water transportation in Alabama began with steamboats, with the first steamboat being the Alabama that was launched in 1818 on the Alabama River. A couple years after the launch of the first steamboat, Alabama began the development of railroad transportation. Railroads solved an abundance of transportation problems and formed opportunities for businessmen. Alabama's first railroad, the Tuscumbia Railway, opened in 1832 in Franklin County. Railroads began to connect Alabama to the rest of the country. In addition, railroads played a major part in the agriculture, politics, and businesses of Alabama. Following the development of railroads, in the beginning of the twentieth century, the Good Roads Movement was organized in efforts to advance modern roads and to persuade the government to further fund the construction and maintenance of the roads. In the early 1900s, the Good Roads movement brought about change in the Alabama state law, which allowed for the production of state highways. This even went a long way in to the 1920s, where the first of many long-distance highways were created in Alabama. Although building the modern roads seemed to bring a rise in the efficiency of transportation, there were some downfalls to building these roads.

More specifically, the IDE includes a GUI designer, code/design views, syntax highlighting, auto completion menus (similar to IntelliSense) the ability to compile and debug form/console .NET Framework applications, a \"New Project\" wizard, toolbars, menus, panels and a docking system, and built-in code refactoring tools, and it has an integrated debugger that allows for stepping, viewing values of objects in memory, and breakpoints.\n\nParagraph 40: After obtaining his doctorate, Heimsoth worked at practices in the Gynecologic University Clinic of Kiel.  At the same time, he became an \"activist of the first homosexual emancipation movement\", but distanced himself from the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee that had formed around Magnus Hirschfeld, because he considered that the theories advocated by the Committee concerning the \"third sex\" were wrong, and based on a reflex or proxy for the heteronormative assumption that sexual attraction is possible only as a function of polar opposites,  even when such polar opposites are embodied within one individual as in the 'third sex'. Theories regarding the 'third sex' from which he chose to distance himself, are ultimately based on the idea that the polarity represented by heterosexuality must be universal, and as such even homosexual individuals and the homosexual orientation itself mus reproduce or emulate that polarity. Heimsoth's theory on the other hand does not rely on heterosexuality to explain homosexuality. Instead it takes homosexuality as it is, as an attraction to the same sex, without any reference to a polarity real or imagined. In his writing Freundesliebe oder Homosexualität (\"Love Between Friends or Homosexuality\"), published in the magazine Der Eigene by Adolf Brand in 1925, Heimsoth showed his antisemitism: \"All heroic and masculine love between friends\" remains, \"in his idea and possibilities of understanding[,] foreign to the Jewish spirit\". Male homosexuality is thus envisioned as not only heroic, but purely masculine, not only in terms of its object of attraction but also in the sexual identity and being of the man in question. In this understanding it is the masculine within the homosexual male that seeks out the same masculinity in other males as sexually attractive without any reference to an assumed internal feminine.   Heimsoth's ideal was that of a whole man, virile and Aryan.  Homoerotic friendships between men were to serve as a nexus of \"obersten Machtaufgebot\" (called higher power).  Heimsoth thought that he could find examples of such heroes among the soldiers of World War I and among the Freikorps environment, as can be gathered from his 1925 publication in the magazine Der Eigene: in it he asked to be sent documentation to demonstrate the \"circumstances and homoerotic relations in the Kampfwagen formations and secret societies\" and wanted to obtain material \"about heroism, the heroic leader problem and the psyche of the volunteers, the desperate, Landsknechte, Freikorps members, and secret societies\".\n\nParagraph 41: While most scholars such as Kenneth Kitchen have equated Manetho's Tefnakht with the king Shepsesre Tefnakht of Sais who is attested by the Year 8 Athens donation stela, a recent article by Olivier Perdu has suggested that this Tefnakht was rather Tefnakht II, a much later king of Sais who ruled in the mid-680's BCE during the late Nubian 25th Dynasty. In his paper, Perdu published a newly discovered stela dating from the second year of Necho I's reign, which he contends is similar in style, text and content to the Year 8 stela of Shepsesre Tefnakht. Perdu, thus, infers that these two kings of Sais—Necho I and Tefnakht II—were close contemporaries. However, his arguments are not currently accepted by most Egyptian scholars such as Dan'el Kahn or Kenneth Kitchen who still believe that the Year 8 Athens stela of king Shepsesre Tefnakht likely belongs to Tefnakht I rather than a hypothetical Tefnakht II who would then have assumed power in 685 BC at Sais—early during the reign of Taharqa, one of the most powerful Nubian rulers of Egypt. Kahn has also stressed at an Egyptological Conference at Leiden that Perdu's epigraphic criteria here in the famed Athens stela—such as the use of the tripartite wig, the method through which the falcon-headed god keeps his head upright in the same stela and on temple wall reliefs contemporary with Tefnakht I's time, the decoration of the stela scene: Heaven supported by wAs scepters—appear already in use in the 24th or early 25th Nubian dynasty during Piye, Shabaka or Bakenranef's reign. The invisible back side of the tripartite wig can be found on the donation stela of Shebitku from Pharbaitos and on the Bakenranef/Bocchoris vase dating to the last days of Piye and the beginning of Shabaka—all appear close in time to the presumed reign of Tefnakht I. Moreover, the head of the falcon-headed god Horus is, as Perdu himself noted, similar in style to the stela of Tefnakht, chief of the Meshwesh and Piye's chief rival.\n\nParagraph 42: In February 2009, Jimmy and Nicola De Souza (Nicola Wheeler) drowned their sorrows together and ended up in the back of an Emmerdale Haulage van, waking up the next morning naked and on their way to Hull. Nicola was horrified; Jimmy was amused. Nicola felt she was too good for Jimmy and refused to consider a relationship. A few weeks later, she asked him to go with her to Home Farm but Jimmy was uncomfortable and got drunk before spending the night with Nicola again.  She dumped him again but when Rodney suggested Jimmy might have some money in Switzerland (where he was going on a business trip), Nicola was suddenly interested. Carl told Jimmy that Nicola was only interested in his money and when Nicola proved Carl right, Jimmy humiliated her by wining and dining her before telling everyone that she was a gold digger and left her at the roadside. Sandy Thomas (Freddie Jones) and Douglas Potts (Duncan Preston), who lived with Nicola, grew so tired of her that they wrote love letters in Jimmy's name, asking her to move in with him. Nicola jumped at the chance of living with him and Jimmy was thrilled. He was shocked to hear about the letters but kept quiet. The truth came out when Betty Eagleton (Paula Tilbrook) read out a similar letter from Sandy. Jimmy admitted that he hadn't written the letter but Nicola demanded he write her a love letter, despite him insisting that he wasn't very good at it. He was proved right and after another argument caused by Jimmy telling Nicola she was curvaceous, which she interpreted as fat, he ended it and Lexi Nicholls (Sally Oliver) insisted that she move out, persuading Laurel Thomas (Charlotte Bellamy) to let Nicola move back into the vicarage. In May 2009, Nicola discovered she was pregnant but didn't tell Jimmy so Rodney did and Jimmy wooed her into a reconciliation, planning to let her tell him about the baby when she was ready. When Nicola found out, she was furious and dumped him again and considered giving the baby up for adoption but Laurel convinced her not to. Jimmy and Nicola bonded when they went for a scan and they decided to give things another go. Nicola returned to Mill Cottage and supported Lexi after her ectopic pregnancy and shock discovery that she was unlikely to conceive again. Scarlett offered to pay for their IVF but Carl told Jimmy (as Scarlett's trustee), not to release the money as he didn't want any more children. Horrified, Nicola insisted Carl tell Lexi. He did and she threw him out, leaving Nicola to comfort her but this led to a fight and Nicola fell down the stairs. Lexi called an ambulance and Nicola and the baby got the all-clear but Nicola blamed Carl for the fight and told him so, warning him to be honest with Lexi. On 6 August, Nicola gave birth prematurely to baby Angelica, who spent a few days in the special care unit. On the 13th, Nicola went for a shower and Lexi took Angelica up to the roof to show her the world. Although Jimmy, Nicola and Scarlett were terrified she'd harm Angelica, Lexi convinced Nicola to trust her and Carl finally admitted that he didn't want any more children and never had. She returned Angelica to Nicola and after a verbal and physical fight with Carl, she left him and Emmerdale for good.\n\nParagraph 43: SharpDevelop was designed as a free and lightweight alternative to Microsoft Visual Studio, and contains an equivalent feature for almost every essential Visual Studio Express feature and features very similar to those found in Borland Kylix and Delphi, including advanced project management, code editing, application compiling and debugging functionality.

There he applied mathematical techniques to problems in textile manufacture, including research on cotton spinning, drafting fibrous materials, and, through L. H. C. Tippett, the use of mathematical statistics in industrial production and quality control. While at the Shirley Institute he also met Leslie Comrie and became interested in computational techniques.  As a result, he spent a month at HM Nautical Almanac Office, London learning Comrie's numerical approaches. In 1936 he collaborated with Douglas Hartree who had built a Differential Analyser at the University of Manchester; together they devised a much cited method for the numerical integration of partial differential equations. In 1937, with war looming, he joined the armaments research department at Woolwich as a scientific officer, and worked on using statistical techniques applied to ballistics and ammunition proofing.  In 1942, after the outbreak of World War II, he was appointed assistant director of scientific research at the Ministry of Supply and asked to set up and head the Advisory Service on Statistical Methods (later known as SR17). This organization was responsible for advice and research into ammunition supply, engineering factories and the investigations of a range of Government Inspectorates. It was particularly important in ensuring quality control and promoting sample inspection methods to British industry during wartime. In 1944 he joined the British Association mathematical tables committee and in the same year he was appointed as the first superintendent of the Mathematics Division of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). In addition to being responsible for statistical quality control, NPL was tasked with building an electronic computer, for which Womersley coined the name Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), echoing Babbage's Analytical Engine.  Womersely was therefore responsible for the set up and operation of the first national computing centre in UK. One of his first actions was to visit the US for a fact-finding tour, where he learned about ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), Howard Aitken's Harvard machine, George Stibitz's machines and von Neumann's plans for the binary computer, EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer). On his return, he recruited Alan Turing to work on the ACE section and backed him strongly. Womersley also recruited Donald Davies in 1947. However, progress on the ACE project was delayed and Turing developed a dislike of Womersley and disdain for his abilities and left the project in 1948. Davies then took over from Turing and a small experimental model, pilot ACE was produced in 1950. Whether Womersely led NPL successfully has been questioned, although the consensus seems to be that he did a good job in difficult circumstances. He himself left the project in 1950, before the prototype pilot ACE was completed, to join the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM), a forerunner of International Computers Limited (ICL). There he recognised that the computers previously developed by academia or governments were too large and expensive to be commercially viable and he recruited Andrew Booth who had developed the All Purpose Electronic Computer at Birbeck University, as a consultant to develop a smaller inexpensive computer. The computer copied from Booth's original design by Ray Bird was named the Hollerith Electronic Computer (HEC1), and was Britain's first mass-produced business computer.\n\nParagraph 48: SharpDevelop was designed as a free and lightweight alternative to Microsoft Visual Studio, and contains an equivalent feature for almost every essential Visual Studio Express feature and features very similar to those found in Borland Kylix and Delphi, including advanced project management, code editing, application compiling and debugging functionality.

Hence, most anarcho-communists view anarcho-communism itself as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society. Furthermore, post-left anarchists like Bob Black went as far as to argue that \"communism is the final fulfillment of individualism. [...] The apparent contradiction between individualism and communism rests on a misunderstanding of both. [...] Subjectivity is also objective: the individual really is subjective. It is nonsense to speak of \"emphatically prioritizing the social over the individual,\" [...]. You may as well speak of prioritizing the chicken over the egg. Anarchy is a \"method of individualization.\" It aims to combine the greatest individual development with the greatest communal unity\". Max Baginski has argued that property and the free market are just other \"spooks\", what Stirner called to refer mere illusions, or ghosts in the mind, writing: \"Modern Communists are more individualistic than Stirner. To them, not merely religion, morality, family and State are spooks, but property also is no more than a spook, in whose name the individual is enslaved — and how enslaved! [...] Communism thus creates a basis for the liberty and Eigenheit of the individual. I am a Communist because I am an Individualist. Fully as heartily the Communists concur with Stirner when he puts the word take in place of demand — that leads to the dissolution of property, to expropriation. Individualism and Communism go hand in hand\". Peter Kropotkin argued that \"Communism is the one which guarantees the greatest amount of individual liberty — provided that the idea that begets the community be Liberty, Anarchy [...]. Communism guarantees economic freedom better than any other form of association, because it can guarantee wellbeing, even luxury, in return for a few hours of work instead of a day's work\". Dielo Truda similarly argued that \"[t]his other society will be libertarian communism, in which social solidarity and free individuality find their full expression, and in which these two ideas develop in perfect harmony\". In \"My Perspectives\" of Willful Disobedience (2: 12), it was argued as such: \"I see the dichotomies made between individualism and communism, individual revolt and class struggle, the struggle against human exploitation and the exploitation of nature as false dichotomies and feel that those who accept them are impoverishing their own critique and struggle\".\n\nParagraph 50: In 2001, Phil gets shot by an unseen assailant and Jamie resolves to take care of his business empire until he recovers. Jamie later suspects that one of Phil's two archenemies, Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) and Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass), is the culprit when he becomes involved in their dangerous feud – up to the point where Dan begins to extort money from Jamie in his revenge against Phil, while Steve begins clashing with Jamie over the escalating situation. Billy, who is working for Steve as his errand boy, learns about Jamie's struggle and taunts him about it until Jamie overpowers Billy in the snooker club and forces him to submit. Moreover, Jamie ends up sharing his theory with Steve's wife and Dan's former girlfriend Mel Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite). By the time Phil has recovered, it is revealed that the shooter was in fact his ex-girlfriend and Mel's best-friend Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin). He doesn't tell Jamie about this, however, and the two resolve to implicate Dan and Steve behind the shooting in order to rid them out of the square for good. Phil sets his plan to frame Dan as the shooter and Steve as an accessory in motion when he contacts Dan's former crime boss, Ritchie Stringer (Gareth Hunt), and lends him Steve's handgun that Lisa used to shoot him; Ritchie later gives Dan the gun under the pretense of being permitted to further extort Phil. Later on that night, Dan threatens Phil at gunpoint and Jamie intervenes when he suspects that something has gone wrong. Dan nearly shoots them until the police arrive and arrest him for shooting Phil. Afterwards, Phil summons his lawyer Marcus Christie (Stephen Churchett) and the two advice Jamie to testify against Dan to ensure he gets sent down. Jamie complies and Phil later entraps Steve into conspiring with him against Dan to rid themselves of their common enemy. However, their plan fails when Dan is found not guilty and he gets revenge on Phil by kidnapping Mel for a £200,000 ransom – with Dan also getting revenge on Steve for conspiring with Phil against him and using Mel as leverage to exact his vengeance.\n\nPlease enter the final count of unique paragraphs after removing duplicates.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In this still image take from video provided by KTNV, police investigate the scene of a shooting between cars on the Las Vegas Strip early Thursday, Feb. 21, 2013 in Las Vegas. Gunshots fired from a black... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Map locates the site of a shooting in Las Vegas that ended in a deadly car crash. (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police believe an altercation earlier at an unspecified casino resort prompted the car-to-car attack in the heart of the Strip at Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Road. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The crossroads is the site of several major hotel-casinos, including Bellagio, Caesars Palace and Bally's. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This doesn't happen where we come from, not on this scale,\" said Mark Thompson, who was visiting from Manchester, England, with his wife. \"We get stabbings, and gang violence, but this is like something out of a movie. Like `Die Hard' or something.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police said they were contacting authorities in three neighboring states about the Range Rover Sport with dark tinted windows, distinctive black custom rims and paper dealer ads in place of license plates that fled the scene about 4:20 a.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Southern California, the California Highway Patrol alerted officers in at least three counties to be on the lookout for the SUV. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Las Vegas Police Sgt. John Sheahan said the Range Rover was last seen near the Venetian resort as it headed north from the shooting scene on Las Vegas Boulevard. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Witnesses also told police the SUV and Maserati had come from the nearby CityCenter area, just south of the site of the attack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have numerous witnesses to this,\" Sheahan said. \"But what is the genesis of this? We don't know yet.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Predawn jogger Eric Lackey was on his way back to the New York-New York hotel when he snapped a cellphone photo of the blazing scene moments after the crash. Black smoke billowed from the flaming taxi, amid popping sounds from the fire. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lackey, of Forest Hill, Md., said a security officer in a yellow shirt performed CPR on a person on the sidewalk while police officers canvassed a small crowd of perhaps 15 onlookers gathering at the scene. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Police were asking if anyone was still in the vehicles and if they heard gunfire,\" Lackey told The Associated Press. \"That's when I realized it wasn't just a regular accident.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sheahan said police have video from traffic cameras at the intersection and were checking hotel surveillance systems. The video will not be made public, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police said the Maserati hit the taxi cab, which went up in flames, and the driver and passenger were killed. The male driver of the Maserati also died, and his passenger was shot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The crumpled, gray sports car, which had no license plates, came to rest several feet away from the incinerated taxi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The people I feel sorry for are the people in the taxi,\" said Elvina Joyce, a tourist from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. \"Seconds made all the difference in the world for them. Wrong place, wrong time.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce and her husband, Dave Joyce, were among the guests staying in high-rise hotels around the scene who found police tape blocking access to normally busy pedestrian crossings at the intersection. Hotel security officers and police shooed away people with cameras, and footbridges linking resort hotels were closed. Traffic around the area was snarled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sheahan said the closures were expected to last most of the day while crime scene investigators collected evidence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"CSI,\" said Dave Joyce. \"There it is. Real crime scene investigators in Las Vegas.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A convention-goer, Jeff Martin, 33, of Columbus, Ohio, said he was unable to cross the Strip several hours after the attack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When you're out at 4 a.m. nothing good's going to happen,\" he said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Late Thursday afternoon, names of two of the deceased became known. The man driving the Maserati has been identified as Kenneth Wayne Cherry Jr., 27. Las Vegas attorney Vicki Greco, of Greco Law Group, had represented Cherry in speeding ticket cases and said friends of his had been calling throughout the day about his death. The deceased taxi driver was identified as Michael Boldon, Desert Cab company general manager Sandy Shaver confirmed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police said a confrontation that appeared to have begun in the valet area of the Aria resort spilled onto Las Vegas Boulevard, leading to sporadic gunshots being fired from the Range Rover as the vehicles traveled north. The accident occurred near Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Road, the site of several major casinos, including Bellagio, Caesars Palace and Bally's. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This doesn't happen where we come from, not on this scale,\" said Mark Thompson, who was visiting from Manchester, England, with his wife. \"We get stabbings, and gang violence, but this is like something out of a movie. Like 'Die Hard' or something.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police were contacting authorities in three neighboring states about the Range Rover Sport with tinted windows and paper dealer plates that fled the scene about 4:30 a.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Metro Police Sgt. John Sheahan said the vehicles were seen pulling onto Las Vegas Boulevard near East Harmon Avenue, near City Center, then heading north. Although authorities initially said gunshots were fired from both the SUV and the Maserati, Sheahan clarified that gunfire came only from the Range Rover. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thursday afternoon, Sheriff Doug Gillespie said after the driver of the Maserati was shot, he lost control of the car passed through a red light and hit the taxi cab, which went up in flames. Boldon and his passenger in the cab were killed. Cherry died in the Maserati, and his passenger was shot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What is the genesis of this, when did this all start? We don't know yet,\" Las Vegas Police Sgt. John Sheahan said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The passenger in the Maserati was taken to University Medical Center, where he was being interviewed by detectives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gillespie said there were several people in the Range Rover, but police were not saying whether they knew of any relationship or ill will between the people in the two vehicles beyond the argument at the valet station. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tourists staying in high-rise hotels around the scene found police tape blocking access to the area around the intersection. By 8 p.m., the intersection was reopened, after police crime scene investigators were finished collecting evidence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jeff Martin, 33, of Columbus, Ohio, said he was unable to cross the Strip several hours after the incident. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When you're out at 4 a.m. nothing good's going to happen,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sheahan said the attack was not a rolling gun battle as previously described. The cars were stopped at a light when at least one person in the Range Rover opened fire. Several people were inside the vehicle, described as a four-door SUV with big black rims. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Multiple rounds were fired from the Range Rover, Gillespie said. He added police did not know whether what kind of firearms were used in the shooting, NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Six other vehicles were involved in the crash that followed, including the taxi and Maserati. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shaver said he was called to the scene to provide information. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shaver also said the taxi that was struck was not fueled by propane or natural gas, as some had speculated. Gillespie said the cab exploded from the \"sheer force\" of the impact of the crash. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Greg Bambic, president of the Professional Drivers Association, a taxi driver organization dedicated to assisting drivers who are victims of crimes and acts of violence, said the group plans to donate $5,000 to the Boldon family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bambic said the organization since 2004 has donated thousands of dollars to drivers who have been robbed and assaulted on the job and their families. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s drivers helping drivers,�? said Bambic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The association raises money through memberships and fund-raisers and it receives donations from Southern Nevada companies that are friendly to the cab industry. Bambic said some of the most supportive donors are the cab companies themselves. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Teri Williams, a spokeswoman for the Nevada Department of Business and Industry, which oversees the Nevada Taxicab Authority, said the agency’s patrol officers were close to the scene when the incident occurred and were among the first responders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Taxicab Authority investigates accidents involving taxicabs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Williams said Metro took over the investigation, but authority officers are continuing to assist. She had no further details about the status of the investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The incident marked the latest violence on the Strip since the beginning of the year. Two people were critically wounded in a shooting at a parking garage Feb. 6, and a tourist was stabbed Saturday in an elevator at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay. On Dec. 14, a busy Friday night at the Excalibur, a murder-suicide near the registration desk of the resort sent crowds visitors running to the exits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A spokesman for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, Jeremy Handel, said his organization didn't immediately have a comment on the latest incident and deferred to police. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Metro spokesman Officer Jose Hernandez acknowledged the Strip has seen several violent incidents in recent weeks but said police have made arrests or identified suspects in each case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"People don't have to worry,\" he said. \"This is an unusual occurrence, as tragic as it may be.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eileen Brosnan, who was visiting Las Vegas from Killarney County Kerry, Ireland, was stunned by what she saw at the scene. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I live in a little small town where we have absolutely no crime,\" she said. \"The only way we hear about things like this is on CNN or news from other places. I knew there was crime here, but I wasn't expecting anything of this magnitude. I don't feel less safe, because there is plenty of security and police to deal with it. It is very surprising to me, though. I was staying at Caesars, and I just had to come down and see it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sheahan said police have video from traffic cameras at the intersection and were checking whether the shooting might have been sparked by an altercation at a nightclub. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have a lot of pieces to put together to establish a timeline as to why this confrontation occurred,\" Sheahan said. \"We have numerous detectives checking resorts on the Strip south of this intersection.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In interviews with Fox 5 KVVU-TV, family members of Boldon said he moved to Las Vegas recently to care for his mother, who is 93. It was not clear where Boldon lived before making the move.

Three people were killed, at least three were injured and this resort city was in a midst of a manhunt Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Las Vegas Boulevard near Flamingo Road -- some of the most valuable real estate along the legendary Strip -- was shut down Thursday morning and probably will stay closed for hours, officials told reporters at a news conference in the shadow of such major hotels as Bellagio, Caesars Palace and Bally’s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It began with a dispute at a nearby hotel and spilled on to the streets,” Capt. Chris Jones, from the Las Vegas Robbery Homicide Division, said. There was no immediate explanation for the altercation, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PHOTOS: Las Vegas rolling gun battle NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Those involved in the dispute took to the road in two vehicles, a silver-gray Maserati and a black Range Rover SUV, with tinted windows, black tire rims and paper dealer plates from out of state, the police captain said. The Maserati sped off at a high rate of speed and the SUV followed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 4:30 a.m. at a stoplight, gunshots were fired from the SUV, police said, hitting the Maserati, which then plowed into a taxi cab that exploded in a fireball on impact. The cab driver and passenger were killed at the scene and Maserati driver was pronounced dead at a hospital. A passenger in the Maserati was among the injured. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The SUV raced off and was being sought by officials who have contacted police authorities in three states to be on the lookout for the vehicle. It was not known how many people were inside the SUV, but all were assumed to be armed and dangerous. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR INTERACTIVE: Violence in Las Vegas NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Las Vegas, which is based on gambling, tourism and convention business, prides itself on being safe for visitors. There have been some incidents in recent weeks, but nothing on the scale of this predawn shooting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tourists waking up Thursday morning faced problems getting around. Bell captains tried to direct lines of people to alternate transportation, including cab lines outside the shut-down zone. Workers in the service industry were delayed through the morning commute. Limousine drivers sought alternate routes. Casino workers coming off their overnight shifts looked for makeshift stops for buses that normally picked up and delivered people along the Strip. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You have to go way out of your way,” Jim DeSanto, driver for a local resort, said. “Most people will understand but you have your complainers. Those people will complain when everything is perfect.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STORIFY: Witnesses capture shooting and fire in tweets and video NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another limousine driver stood outside his black stretch vehicle. Malik Alamudeen, a driver for 24-7 Entertainment Limousines, said the traffic snarls cost him at least $500 in tips. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The shooting was the talk of the area, even among the denizens of the night, such as Paul Pillat, 58, formerly of Milwaukee, Wis. He described himself as a homeless person who has been trawling the streets for years. He said he was known by his street name, Tumbleweed, and he was heading to a fast-food restaurant near the intersection about 4:20 a.m. when he heard the gunshots. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I ducked right away,” Pillat said. “I didn’t know what was going on. Somebody could have been shooting at me.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said he did not see the impact, but heard the crash of vehicles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Then the ambulances started coming, it was like a stock car rally out there,” he said, adding he had come to expect violence. “It’s the wild West here. People don’t understand. They think it is fun and games. It’s not. It’s dangerous.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But many tourists were more sanguine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Inside the casinos, the hurly-burly of the gambling continued with one person, who refused to give his name, pulling the handle of a slot machine. “I’m here for the day and I’m going to get my gambling in,” he said, turning back to the machine at Bally’s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Look at what happened in Orange County this week,” Gaspar Pasqualetto, of Diamond Bar, 83, said of a shooting spree that left four dead, including the gunman. He said he learned of the Nevada shooting when he arrived at Las Vegas on Thursday morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Racing form in hand, Pasqualetto waved as he headed to the sports book inside Bally’s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Wish me luck,” he said.

{"article": "You are given several news passages. Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews:\nPassage 1:\nThe most important person in the English-language world is Frank Sinatra, according to an analysis of Wikipedia articles led by the University of Toulouse's Young-Ho Eom. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Number two is Michael Jackson, and number three is Pope Pius XII. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eom arrived at this somewhat surprising conclusion by using methods borrowed from Google to analyse Wikipedia pages and determine which individuals have the most important articles linking to them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Taking all 24 major language editions of Wikipedia into account, Eom's team carried out the same study and came to a more plausible conclusion: Adolf Hitler. (Even then, Michael Jackson takes the second slot, and Madonna is in third place.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The point of the study wasn't strictly to determine who the most important people are on Wikipedia, but instead to discover if the online encyclopaedia was skewed in the level of attention it gives to various figures, either by gender, time, or location. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Our analysis shows that most important historical ﬁgures across Wikipedia language editions are born in western countries after the 17th century, and are male,\" the authors write. But, they add, \"each Wikipedia edition highlights local figures, so that most of its own historical figures are born in the countries which use the language of the edition. The emergence of such pronounced accent to local figures seems to be natural since there are more links and interactions within one culture.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study takes as its starting point Google's PageRank algorithm. This is still the basic method the search engine uses to decide the basic importance of webpages in its index, although the system has received an almost total overhaul since it was first introduced in 1998. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PageRank says that a page is important if a lot of important pages link to it. While the definition sounds self-referential, in practice, it recreates a lot of features which we intuitively understand: the more sites link to a newspaper's website, for instance, the more important that website is; and being linked to from a national newspaper probably says more about a site's importance than being linked to from a nondescript blog. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But when the study applied PageRank to figures on Wikipedia, the results were odd. The most important person in the world comes out as Carl Linnaeus, the 18th-century Swedish naturalist – certainly an important feature in natural history, but possibly not the most important in the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It seems the algorithm was thrown by a quirk of Wikipedia: the site contains an almost complete collection of named species – as well as who named them. Since Linnaeus' life work was coming up with a system to classify organisms, and applying that system as widely as possible, he is linked to from a lot of pages, and important ones at that. From the Domestic Cat to the Red Fox, through the mighty Asian elephant and the lowly moss gall, Linnaeus named, and is linked from, them all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To get around that issue, the researchers applied a second way of measuring importance: CheiRank. Simply put, \"the PageRank… of an article is proportional to the number of incoming links, while the CheiRank… of an article is proportional to the number of outgoing links. Thus a top PageRank article is important since other articles refer to it, while a top CheiRank article is highly connected because it refers to other articles.\" In other words, an important person is likely to have a lot of other important people and things involved in their lives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mix Pagerank and CheiRank together, and you get the final measure: 2DRank. That's how the authors arrived at the top 100 for all 24 editions of Wikipedia – and how Frank Sinatra took pole position. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR • Wikipedia's Jimmy Wales: 'It's true, I'm not a billionaire. So?'\nPassage 2:\nThese crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to. That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved.Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors.The goal is to fix all broken links on the web . Crawls of supported \"No More 404\" sites.\nPassage 3:\nEven Sir Isaac Newton recognized that intellectual success depended on what had come before: \"If I have seen further, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants,” he so famously said. But while we may all wield influence in our own domains, some people (say, the ones who inspired Newton) are just more influential than others. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an intriguing new study, a team led by University of Tolouse researcher Young-Ho Eom sought to figure out who, exactly, should be considered the most influential thinker in the world. Trawling through 24 different language editions of Wikipedia, Eom's team calculated whose intellectual fingers stretched out the furthest. The goal was to study who was at the heart of the biggest branching web of links, the page of the person who, if you spent long enough link jumping through Wikipedia's nearly endless treasures, you'd end up on the most. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The result was... somewhat surprising. According to Eom and co., the world's most influential mind was Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus. Linneaus beat out everyone, from the Pope to President Obama to Frank Sinatra, Hitler, Caesar—even Jesus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If it's been a while since introductory biology, you may be scratching your head trying to remember who Carl Linnaeus even is. \"The Father of Taxonomy,\" Linneaus invented the scientific system of naming that is still, generally, in use today. It's under Linnaeus' system that human beings became Homo sapiens, and taxonomical gifts like Llama glama, Vini vidivici, Apopyllus now and Ytu brutus came to be. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was Linnaeus' particular scientific penchant, combined with the specifics of Young-Ho Eom's method of searching Wikipedia, says New Scientist, that led to the unexpected result: “Linnaeus topped the chart across all languages because there are so many Wikipedia pages with scientific names in every edition, and they all eventually lead back to him.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This isn't the first time people have tried to figure out the influence of various historical people, of course, and Linnaeus is not a reliable entrant on the list. Last year Jasleen Kaur, Filippo Radicchi and Filippo Menczer tried to calculate which academic has had the most influence over the years. Using their approach, which studied how often academics referenced each other in their own work, the team found that Karl Marx was history's most influential scholar.\n\n\nNow, write a one-page summary of all the news.\n\nSummary:", "summary_gt": "", "input_tokens": 1178, "output_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 1178, "source_file": "multi_news.jsonl"}

{"article": "You are given a scientific article and a question. Answer the question as concisely as you can, using a single phrase or sentence if possible. If the question cannot be answered based on the information in the article, write \"unanswerable\". If the question is a yes/no question, answer \"yes\", \"no\", or \"unanswerable\". Do not provide any explanation.\n\nArticle: Introduction\nDespite the rapid progress of deep learning techniques on diverse supervised learning tasks, these models remain brittle to subtle shifts in the data distribution. Even when the permissible changes are confined to barely-perceptible perturbations, training robust models remains an open challenge. Following the discovery that imperceptible attacks could cause image recognition models to misclassify examples BIBREF0 , a veritable sub-field has emerged in which authors iteratively propose attacks and countermeasures.\nFor all the interest in adversarial computer vision, these attacks are rarely encountered outside of academic research. However, adversarial misspellings constitute a longstanding real-world problem. Spammers continually bombard email servers, subtly misspelling words in efforts to evade spam detection while preserving the emails' intended meaning BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 . As another example, programmatic censorship on the Internet has spurred communities to adopt similar methods to communicate surreptitiously BIBREF3 .\nIn this paper, we focus on adversarially-chosen spelling mistakes in the context of text classification, addressing the following attack types: dropping, adding, and swapping internal characters within words. These perturbations are inspired by psycholinguistic studies BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 which demonstrated that humans can comprehend text altered by jumbling internal characters, provided that the first and last characters of each word remain unperturbed.\nFirst, in experiments addressing both BiLSTM and fine-tuned BERT models, comprising four different input formats: word-only, char-only, word+char, and word-piece BIBREF6 , we demonstrate that an adversary can degrade a classifier's performance to that achieved by random guessing. This requires altering just two characters per sentence. Such modifications might flip words either to a different word in the vocabulary or, more often, to the out-of-vocabulary token UNK. Consequently, adversarial edits can degrade a word-level model by transforming the informative words to UNK. Intuitively, one might suspect that word-piece and character-level models would be less susceptible to spelling attacks as they can make use of the residual word context. However, our experiments demonstrate that character and word-piece models are in fact more vulnerable. We show that this is due to the adversary's effective capacity for finer grained manipulations on these models. While against a word-level model, the adversary is mostly limited to UNK-ing words, against a word-piece or character-level model, each character-level add, drop, or swap produces a distinct input, providing the adversary with a greater set of options.\nSecond, we evaluate first-line techniques including data augmentation and adversarial training, demonstrating that they offer only marginal benefits here, e.g., a BERT model achieving $90.3$ accuracy on a sentiment classification task, is degraded to $64.1$ by an adversarially-chosen 1-character swap in the sentence, which can only be restored to $69.2$ by adversarial training.\nThird (our primary contribution), we propose a task-agnostic defense, attaching a word recognition model that predicts each word in a sentence given a full sequence of (possibly misspelled) inputs. The word recognition model's outputs form the input to a downstream classification model. Our word recognition models build upon the RNN-based semi-character word recognition model due to BIBREF7 . While our word recognizers are trained on domain-specific text from the task at hand, they often predict UNK at test time, owing to the small domain-specific vocabulary. To handle unobserved and rare words, we propose several backoff strategies including falling back on a generic word recognizer trained on a larger corpus. Incorporating our defenses, BERT models subject to 1-character attacks are restored to $88.3$ , $81.1$ , $78.0$ accuracy for swap, drop, add attacks respectively, as compared to $69.2$ , $63.6$ , and $50.0$ for adversarial training\nFourth, we offer a detailed qualitative analysis, demonstrating that a low word error rate alone is insufficient for a word recognizer to confer robustness on the downstream task. Additionally, we find that it is important that the recognition model supply few degrees of freedom to an attacker. We provide a metric to quantify this notion of sensitivity in word recognition models and study its relation to robustness empirically. Models with low sensitivity and word error rate are most robust.\nRelated Work\nSeveral papers address adversarial attacks on NLP systems. Changes to text, whether word- or character-level, are all perceptible, raising some questions about what should rightly be considered an adversarial example BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 . BIBREF10 address the reading comprehension task, showing that by appending distractor sentences to the end of stories from the SQuAD dataset BIBREF11 , they could cause models to output incorrect answers. Inspired by this work, BIBREF12 demonstrate an attack that breaks entailment systems by replacing a single word with either a synonym or its hypernym. Recently, BIBREF13 investigated the problem of producing natural-seeming adversarial examples, noting that adversarial examples in NLP are often ungrammatical BIBREF14 .\nIn related work on character-level attacks, BIBREF8 , BIBREF15 explored gradient-based methods to generate string edits to fool classification and translation systems, respectively. While their focus is on efficient methods for generating adversaries, ours is on improving the worst case adversarial performance. Similarly, BIBREF9 studied how synthetic and natural noise affects character-level machine translation. They considered structure invariant representations and adversarial training as defenses against such noise. Here, we show that an auxiliary word recognition model, which can be trained on unlabeled data, provides a strong defense.\nSpelling correction BIBREF16 is often viewed as a sub-task of grammatical error correction BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 . Classic methods rely on a source language model and a noisy channel model to find the most likely correction for a given word BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 . Recently, neural techniques have been applied to the task BIBREF7 , BIBREF21 , which model the context and orthography of the input together. Our work extends the ScRNN model of BIBREF7 .\nRobust Word Recognition\nTo tackle character-level adversarial attacks, we introduce a simple two-stage solution, placing a word recognition model ( $W$ ) before the downstream classifier ( $C$ ). Under this scheme, all inputs are classified by the composed model $C \\circ W$ . This modular approach, with $W$ and $C$ trained separately, offers several benefits: (i) we can deploy the same word recognition model for multiple downstream classification tasks/models; and (ii) we can train the word recognition model with larger unlabeled corpora.\nAgainst adversarial mistakes, two important factors govern the robustness of this combined model: $W$ 's accuracy in recognizing misspelled words and $W$ 's sensitivity to adversarial perturbations on the same input. We discuss these aspects in detail below.\nScRNN with Backoff\nWe now describe semi-character RNNs for word recognition, explain their limitations, and suggest techniques to improve them.\nInspired by the psycholinguistic studies BIBREF5 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF7 proposed a semi-character based RNN (ScRNN) that processes a sentence of words with misspelled characters, predicting the correct words at each step. Let $s = \\lbrace w_1, w_2, \\dots , w_n\\rbrace $ denote the input sentence, a sequence of constituent words $w_i$ . Each input word ( $w_i$ ) is represented by concatenating (i) a one hot vector of the first character ( $\\mathbf {w_{i1}}$ ); (ii) a one hot representation of the last character ( $\\mathbf {w_{il}}$ , where $l$ is the length of word $w_i$ ); and (iii) a bag of characters representation of the internal characters ( $\\sum _{j=2}^{l-1}\\mathbf {w_{ij}})$ . ScRNN treats the first and the last characters individually, and is agnostic to the ordering of the internal characters. Each word, represented accordingly, is then fed into a BiLSTM cell. At each sequence step, the training target is the correct corresponding word (output dimension equal to vocabulary size), and the model is optimized with cross-entropy loss.\nWhile BIBREF7 demonstrate strong word recognition performance, a drawback of their evaluation setup is that they only attack and evaluate on the subset of words that are a part of their training vocabulary. In such a setting, the word recognition performance is unreasonably dependent on the chosen vocabulary size. In principle, one can design models to predict (correctly) only a few chosen words, and ignore the remaining majority and still reach 100% accuracy. For the adversarial setting, rare and unseen words in the wild are particularly critical, as they provide opportunities for the attackers. A reliable word-recognizer should handle these cases gracefully. Below, we explore different ways to back off when the ScRNN predicts UNK (a frequent outcome for rare and unseen words):\nPass-through: word-recognizer passes on the (possibly misspelled) word as is.\nBackoff to neutral word: Alternatively, noting that passing $\\colorbox {gray!20}{\\texttt {UNK}}$ -predicted words through unchanged exposes the downstream model to potentially corrupted text, we consider backing off to a neutral word like `a', which has a similar distribution across classes.\nBackoff to background model: We also consider falling back upon a more generic word recognition model trained upon a larger, less-specialized corpus whenever the foreground word recognition model predicts UNK. Figure 1 depicts this scenario pictorially.\nEmpirically, we find that the background model (by itself) is less accurate, because of the large number of words it is trained to predict. Thus, it is best to train a precise foreground model on an in-domain corpus and focus on frequent words, and then to resort to a general-purpose background model for rare and unobserved words. Next, we delineate our second consideration for building robust word-recognizers.\nModel Sensitivity\nIn computer vision, an important factor determining the success of an adversary is the norm constraint on the perturbations allowed to an image ( $|| \\bf x - \\bf x^{\\prime }||_{\\infty } < \\epsilon $ ). Higher values of $\\epsilon $ lead to a higher chance of mis-classification for at least one $\\bf x^{\\prime }$ . Defense methods such as quantization BIBREF22 and thermometer encoding BIBREF23 try to reduce the space of perturbations available to the adversary by making the model invariant to small changes in the input.\nIn NLP, we often get such invariance for free, e.g., for a word-level model, most of the perturbations produced by our character-level adversary lead to an UNK at its input. If the model is robust to the presence of these UNK tokens, there is little room for an adversary to manipulate it. Character-level models, on the other hand, despite their superior performance in many tasks, do not enjoy such invariance. This characteristic invariance could be exploited by an attacker. Thus, to limit the number of different inputs to the classifier, we wish to reduce the number of distinct word recognition outputs that an attacker can induce, not just the number of words on which the model is “fooled”. We denote this property of a model as its sensitivity.\nWe can quantify this notion for a word recognition system $W$ as the expected number of unique outputs it assigns to a set of adversarial perturbations. Given a sentence $s$ from the set of sentences $\\mathcal {S}$ , let $A(s) = {s_1}^{\\prime } , {s_2}^{\\prime }, \\dots , {s_n}^{\\prime }$ denote the set of $n$ perturbations to it under attack type $A$ , and let $V$ be the function that maps strings to an input representation for the downstream classifier. For a word level model, $V$ would transform sentences to a sequence of word ids, mapping OOV words to the same UNK ID. Whereas, for a char (or word+char, word-piece) model, $V$ would map inputs to a sequence of character IDs. Formally, sensitivity is defined as\n$$S_{W,V}^A=\\mathbb {E}_{s}\\left[\\frac{\\#_{u}(V \\circ W({s_1}^{\\prime }), \\dots , V \\circ W({s_n}^{\\prime }))}{n}\\right] ,$$   (Eq. 12)\nwhere $V \\circ W (s_i)$ returns the input representation (of the downstream classifier) for the output string produced by the word-recognizer $W$ using $s_i$ and $\\#_{u}(\\cdot )$ counts the number of unique arguments.\nIntuitively, we expect a high value of $S_{W, V}^A$ to lead to a lower robustness of the downstream classifier, since the adversary has more degrees of freedom to attack the classifier. Thus, when using word recognition as a defense, it is prudent to design a low sensitivity system with a low error rate. However, as we will demonstrate, there is often a trade-off between sensitivity and error rate.\nSynthesizing Adversarial Attacks\nSuppose we are given a classifier $C: \\mathcal {S} \\rightarrow \\mathcal {Y}$ which maps natural language sentences $s \\in \\mathcal {S}$ to a label from a predefined set $y \\in \\mathcal {Y}$ . An adversary for this classifier is a function $A$ which maps a sentence $s$ to its perturbed versions $\\lbrace s^{\\prime }_1, s^{\\prime }_2, \\ldots , s^{\\prime }_{n}\\rbrace $ such that each $s^{\\prime }_i$ is close to $s$ under some notion of distance between sentences. We define the robustness of classifier $C$ to the adversary $A$ as:\n$$R_{C,A} = \\mathbb {E}_s \\left[\\min _{s^{\\prime } \\in A(s)} \\mathbb {1}[C(s^{\\prime }) = y]\\right],$$   (Eq. 14)\nwhere $y$ represents the ground truth label for $s$ . In practice, a real-world adversary may only be able to query the classifier a few times, hence $R_{C,A}$ represents the worst-case adversarial performance of $C$ . Methods for generating adversarial examples, such as HotFlip BIBREF8 , focus on efficient algorithms for searching the $\\min $ above. Improving $R_{C,A}$ would imply better robustness against all these methods.\nWe explore adversaries which perturb sentences with four types of character-level edits:\n(1) Swap: swapping two adjacent internal characters of a word. (2) Drop: removing an internal character of a word. (3) Keyboard: substituting an internal character with adjacent characters of QWERTY keyboard (4) Add: inserting a new character internally in a word. In line with the psycholinguistic studies BIBREF5 , BIBREF4 , to ensure that the perturbations do not affect human ability to comprehend the sentence, we only allow the adversary to edit the internal characters of a word, and not edit stopwords or words shorter than 4 characters.\nFor 1-character attacks, we try all possible perturbations listed above until we find an adversary that flips the model prediction. For 2-character attacks, we greedily fix the edit which had the least confidence among 1-character attacks, and then try all the allowed perturbations on the remaining words. Higher order attacks can be performed in a similar manner. The greedy strategy reduces the computation required to obtain higher order attacks, but also means that the robustness score is an upper bound on the true robustness of the classifier.\nExperiments and Results\nIn this section, we first discuss our experiments on the word recognition systems.\nWord Error Correction\nData: We evaluate the spell correctors from § \"Robust Word Recognition\" on movie reviews from the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) BIBREF24 . The SST dataset consists of 8544 movie reviews, with a vocabulary of over 16K words. As a background corpus, we use the IMDB movie reviews BIBREF25 , which contain 54K movie reviews, and a vocabulary of over 78K words. The two datasets do not share any reviews in common. The spell-correction models are evaluated on their ability to correct misspellings. The test setting consists of reviews where each word (with length $\\ge 4$ , barring stopwords) is attacked by one of the attack types (from swap, add, drop and keyboard attacks). In the all attack setting, we mix all attacks by randomly choosing one for each word. This most closely resembles a real world attack setting.\nIn addition to our word recognition models, we also compare to After The Deadline (ATD), an open-source spell corrector. We found ATD to be the best freely-available corrector. We refer the reader to BIBREF7 for comparisons of ScRNN to other anonymized commercial spell checkers.\nFor the ScRNN model, we use a single-layer Bi-LSTM with a hidden dimension size of 50. The input representation consists of 198 dimensions, which is thrice the number of unique characters (66) in the vocabulary. We cap the vocabulary size to 10K words, whereas we use the entire vocabulary of 78470 words when we backoff to the background model. For training these networks, we corrupt the movie reviews according to all attack types, i.e., applying one of the 4 attack types to each word, and trying to reconstruct the original words via cross entropy loss.\nWe calculate the word error rates (WER) of each of the models for different attacks and present our findings in Table 2 . Note that ATD incorrectly predicts $11.2$ words for every 100 words (in the `all' setting), whereas, all of the backoff variations of the ScRNN reconstruct better. The most accurate variant involves backing off to the background model, resulting in a low error rate of $6.9\\%$ , leading to the best performance on word recognition. This is a $32\\%$ relative error reduction compared to the vanilla ScRNN model with a pass-through backoff strategy. We can attribute the improved performance to the fact that there are $5.25\\%$ words in the test corpus that are unseen in the training corpus, and are thus only recoverable by backing off to a larger corpus. Notably, only training on the larger background corpus does worse, at $8.7\\%$ , since the distribution of word frequencies is different in the background corpus compared to the foreground corpus.\nRobustness to adversarial attacks\nWe use sentiment analysis and paraphrase detection as downstream tasks, as for these two tasks, 1-2 character edits do not change the output labels.\nFor sentiment classification, we systematically study the effect of character-level adversarial attacks on two architectures and four different input formats. The first architecture encodes the input sentence into a sequence of embeddings, which are then sequentially processed by a BiLSTM. The first and last states of the BiLSTM are then used by the softmax layer to predict the sentiment of the input. We consider three input formats for this architecture: (1) Word-only: where the input words are encoded using a lookup table; (2) Char-only: where the input words are encoded using a separate single-layered BiLSTM over their characters; and (3) Word $+$ Char: where the input words are encoded using a concatenation of (1) and (2) .\nThe second architecture uses the fine-tuned BERT model BIBREF26 , with an input format of word-piece tokenization. This model has recently set a new state-of-the-art on several NLP benchmarks, including the sentiment analysis task we consider here. All models are trained and evaluated on the binary version of the sentence-level Stanford Sentiment Treebank BIBREF24 dataset with only positive and negative reviews.\nWe also consider the task of paraphrase detection. Here too, we make use of the fine-tuned BERT BIBREF26 , which is trained and evaluated on the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC) BIBREF27 .\nTwo common methods for dealing with adversarial examples include: (1) data augmentation (DA) BIBREF28 ; and (2) adversarial training (Adv) BIBREF29 . In DA, the trained model is fine-tuned after augmenting the training set with an equal number of examples randomly attacked with a 1-character edit. In Adv, the trained model is fine-tuned with additional adversarial examples (selected at random) that produce incorrect predictions from the current-state classifier. The process is repeated iteratively, generating and adding newer adversarial examples from the updated classifier model, until the adversarial accuracy on dev set stops improving.\nIn Table 3 , we examine the robustness of the sentiment models under each attack and defense method. In the absence of any attack or defense, BERT (a word-piece model) performs the best ( $90.3\\%$ ) followed by word+char models ( $80.5\\%$ ), word-only models ( $79.2\\%$ ) and then char-only models ( $70.3\\%$ ). However, even single-character attacks (chosen adversarially) can be catastrophic, resulting in a significantly degraded performance of $46\\%$ , $57\\%$ , $59\\%$ and $33\\%$ , respectively under the `all' setting.\nIntuitively, one might suppose that word-piece and character-level models would be more robust to such attacks given they can make use of the remaining context. However, we find that they are the more susceptible. To see why, note that the word `beautiful' can only be altered in a few ways for word-only models, either leading to an UNK or an existing vocabulary word, whereas, word-piece and character-only models treat each unique character combination differently. This provides more variations that an attacker can exploit. Following similar reasoning, add and key attacks pose a greater threat than swap and drop attacks. The robustness of different models can be ordered as word-only $>$ word+char $>$ char-only $\\sim $ word-piece, and the efficacy of different attacks as add $>$ key $>$ drop $>$ swap.\nNext, we scrutinize the effectiveness of defense methods when faced against adversarially chosen attacks. Clearly from table 3 , DA and Adv are not effective in this case. We observed that despite a low training error, these models were not able to generalize to attacks on newer words at test time. ATD spell corrector is the most effective on keyboard attacks, but performs poorly on other attack types, particularly the add attack strategy.\nThe ScRNN model with pass-through backoff offers better protection, bringing back the adversarial accuracy within $5\\%$ range for the swap attack. It is also effective under other attack classes, and can mitigate the adversarial effect in word-piece models by $21\\%$ , character-only models by $19\\%$ , and in word, and word+char models by over $4.5\\%$ . This suggests that the direct training signal of word error correction is more effective than the indirect signal of sentiment classification available to DA and Adv for model robustness.\nWe observe additional gains by using background models as a backoff alternative, because of its lower word error rate (WER), especially, under the swap and drop attacks. However, these gains do not consistently translate in all other settings, as lower WER is necessary but not sufficient. Besides lower error rate, we find that a solid defense should furnish the attacker the fewest options to attack, i.e. it should have a low sensitivity.\nAs we shall see in section § \"Understanding Model Sensitivity\" , the backoff neutral variation has the lowest sensitivity due to mapping UNK predictions to a fixed neutral word. Thus, it results in the highest robustness on most of the attack types for all four model classes.\nTable 4 shows the accuracy of BERT on 200 examples from the dev set of the MRPC paraphrase detection task under various attack and defense settings. We re-trained the ScRNN model variants on the MRPC training set for these experiments. Again, we find that simple 1-2 character attacks can bring down the accuracy of BERT significantly ( $89\\%$ to $31\\%$ ). Word recognition models can provide an effective defense, with both our pass-through and neutral variants recovering most of the accuracy. While the neutral backoff model is effective on 2-char attacks, it hurts performance in the no attack setting, since it incorrectly modifies certain correctly spelled entity names. Since the two variants are already effective, we did not train a background model for this task.\nUnderstanding Model Sensitivity\nTo study model sensitivity, for each sentence, we perturb one randomly-chosen word and replace it with all possible perturbations under a given attack type. The resulting set of perturbed sentences is then fed to the word recognizer (whose sensitivity is to be estimated). As described in equation 12 , we count the number of unique predictions from the output sentences. Two corrections are considered unique if they are mapped differently by the downstream classifier.\nThe neutral backoff variant has the lowest sensitivity (Table 5 ). This is expected, as it returns a fixed neutral word whenever the ScRNN predicts an UNK, therefore reducing the number of unique outputs it predicts. Open vocabulary (i.e. char-only, word+char, word-piece) downstream classifiers consider every unique combination of characters differently, whereas word-only classifiers internally treat all out of vocabulary (OOV) words alike. Hence, for char-only, word+char, and word-piece models, the pass-through version is more sensitive than the background variant, as it passes words as is (and each combination is considered uniquely). However, for word-only models, pass-through is less sensitive as all the OOV character combinations are rendered identical.\nIdeally, a preferred defense is one with low sensitivity and word error rate. In practice, however, we see that a low error rate often comes at the cost of sensitivity. We see this trade-off in Figure 2 , where we plot WER and sensitivity on the two axes, and depict the robustness when using different backoff variants. Generally, sensitivity is the more dominant factor out of the two, as the error rates of the considered variants are reasonably low.\nWe verify if the sentiment (of the reviews) is preserved with char-level attacks. In a human study with 50 attacked (and subsequently misclassified), and 50 unchanged reviews, it was noted that 48 and 49, respectively, preserved the sentiment.\nConclusion\nAs character and word-piece inputs become commonplace in modern NLP pipelines, it is worth highlighting the vulnerability they add. We show that minimally-doctored attacks can bring down accuracy of classifiers to random guessing. We recommend word recognition as a safeguard against this and build upon RNN-based semi-character word recognizers. We discover that when used as a defense mechanism, the most accurate word recognition models are not always the most robust against adversarial attacks. Additionally, we highlight the need to control the sensitivity of these models to achieve high robustness.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful to Graham Neubig, Eduard Hovy, Paul Michel, Mansi Gupta, and Antonios Anastasopoulos for suggestions and feedback.\n\n Answer the question based on the above article as concisely as you can, using a single phrase or sentence if possible.

As a result, unsupervised methods that learn directly from unlabeled data are increasingly important. For tasks related to unsupervised syntactic analysis, discrete generative models have dominated in recent years – for example, for both part-of-speech (POS) induction BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 and unsupervised dependency parsing BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 . While similar models have had success on a range of unsupervised tasks, they have mostly ignored the apparent utility of continuous word representations evident from supervised NLP applications BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 . In this work, we focus on leveraging and explicitly representing continuous word embeddings within unsupervised models of syntactic structure.\nPre-trained word embeddings from massive unlabeled corpora offer a compact way of injecting a prior notion of word similarity into models that would otherwise treat words as discrete, isolated categories. However, the specific properties of language captured by any particular embedding scheme can be difficult to control, and, further, may not be ideally suited to the task at hand. For example, pre-trained skip-gram embeddings BIBREF7 with small context window size are found to capture the syntactic properties of language well BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 . However, if our goal is to separate syntactic categories, this embedding space is not ideal – POS categories correspond to overlapping interspersed regions in the embedding space, evident in Figure SECREF4 .\nIn our approach, we propose to learn a new latent embedding space as a projection of pre-trained embeddings (depicted in Figure SECREF5 ), while jointly learning latent syntactic structure – for example, POS categories or syntactic dependencies. To this end, we introduce a new generative model (shown in Figure FIGREF6 ) that first generates a latent syntactic representation (e.g. a dependency parse) from a discrete structured prior (which we also call the “syntax model”), then, conditioned on this representation, generates a sequence of latent embedding random variables corresponding to each word, and finally produces the observed (pre-trained) word embeddings by projecting these latent vectors through a parameterized non-linear function. The latent embeddings can be jointly learned with the structured syntax model in a completely unsupervised fashion.\nBy choosing an invertible neural network as our non-linear projector, and then parameterizing our model in terms of the projection's inverse, we are able to derive tractable exact inference and marginal likelihood computation procedures so long as inference is tractable in the underlying syntax model. In sec:learn-with-inv we show that this derivation corresponds to an alternate view of our approach whereby we jointly learn a mapping of observed word embeddings to a new embedding space that is more suitable for the syntax model, but include an additional Jacobian regularization term to prevent information loss.\nRecent work has sought to take advantage of word embeddings in unsupervised generative models with alternate approaches BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 . BIBREF9 build an HMM with Gaussian emissions on observed word embeddings, but they do not attempt to learn new embeddings. BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , and BIBREF12 extend HMM or dependency model with valence (DMV) BIBREF2 with multinomials that use word (or tag) embeddings in their parameterization. However, they do not represent the embeddings as latent variables.\nIn experiments, we instantiate our approach using both a Markov-structured syntax model and a tree-structured syntax model – specifically, the DMV. We evaluate on two tasks: part-of-speech (POS) induction and unsupervised dependency parsing without gold POS tags. Experimental results on the Penn Treebank BIBREF13 demonstrate that our approach improves the basic HMM and DMV by a large margin, leading to the state-of-the-art results on POS induction, and state-of-the-art results on unsupervised dependency parsing in the difficult training scenario where neither gold POS annotation nor punctuation-based constraints are available.\nModel\nAs an illustrative example, we first present a baseline model for Markov syntactic structure (POS induction) that treats a sequence of pre-trained word embeddings as observations. Then, we propose our novel approach, again using Markov structure, that introduces latent word embedding variables and a neural projector. Lastly, we extend our approach to more general syntactic structures.\nExample: Gaussian HMM\nWe start by describing the Gaussian hidden Markov model introduced by BIBREF9 , which is a locally normalized model with multinomial transitions and Gaussian emissions. Given a sentence of length INLINEFORM0 , we denote the latent POS tags as INLINEFORM1 , observed (pre-trained) word embeddings as INLINEFORM2 , transition parameters as INLINEFORM3 , and Gaussian emission parameters as INLINEFORM4 . The joint distribution of data and latent variables factors as:\nDISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the multinomial transition probability and INLINEFORM1 is the multivariate Gaussian emission probability.\nWhile the observed word embeddings do inform this model with a notion of word similarity – lacking in the basic multinomial HMM – the Gaussian emissions may not be sufficiently flexible to separate some syntactic categories in the complex pre-trained embedding space – for example the skip-gram embedding space as visualized in Figure SECREF4 where different POS categories overlap. Next we introduce a new approach that adds flexibility to the emission distribution by incorporating new latent embedding variables.\nMarkov Structure with Neural Projector\nTo flexibly model observed embeddings and yield a new representation space that is more suitable for the syntax model, we propose to cascade a neural network as a projection function, deterministically transforming the simple space defined by the Gaussian HMM to the observed embedding space. We denote the latent embedding of the INLINEFORM0 word in a sentence as INLINEFORM1 , and the neural projection function as INLINEFORM2 , parameterized by INLINEFORM3 . In the case of sequential Markov structure, our new model corresponds to the following generative process:\nFor each time step INLINEFORM0 ,\n[noitemsep, leftmargin=*]\nDraw the latent state INLINEFORM0\nDraw the latent embedding INLINEFORM0\nDeterministically produce embedding\nINLINEFORM0\nThe graphical model is depicted in Figure FIGREF6 . The deterministic projection can also be viewed as sampling each observation from a point mass at INLINEFORM0 . The joint distribution of our model is: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is a conditional Gaussian distribution, and INLINEFORM1 is the Dirac delta function centered at INLINEFORM2 : DISPLAYFORM0\nGeneral Structure with Neural Projector\nOur approach can be applied to a broad family of structured syntax models. We denote latent embedding variables as INLINEFORM0 , discrete latent variables in the syntax model as INLINEFORM1 ( INLINEFORM2 ), where INLINEFORM3 are conditioned to generate INLINEFORM4 . The joint probability of our model factors as:\nDISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 represents the probability of the syntax model, and can encode any syntactic structure – though, its factorization structure will determine whether inference is tractable in our full model. As shown in Figure FIGREF6 , we focus on two syntax models for syntactic analysis in this paper. The first is Markov-structured, which we use for POS induction, and the second is DMV-structured, which we use to learn dependency parses without supervision.\nThe marginal data likelihood of our model is: DISPLAYFORM0\nWhile the discrete variables INLINEFORM0 can be marginalized out with dynamic program in many cases, it is generally intractable to marginalize out the latent continuous variables, INLINEFORM1 , for an arbitrary projection INLINEFORM2 in Eq. ( EQREF17 ), which means inference and learning may be difficult. In sec:opt, we address this issue by constraining INLINEFORM3 to be invertible, and show that this constraint enables tractable exact inference and marginal likelihood computation.\nLearning & Inference\nIn this section, we introduce an invertibility condition for our neural projector to tackle the optimization challenge. Specifically, we constrain our neural projector with two requirements: (1) INLINEFORM0 and (2) INLINEFORM1 exists. Invertible transformations have been explored before in independent components analysis BIBREF14 , gaussianization BIBREF15 , and deep density models BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , for unstructured data. Here, we generalize this style of approach to structured learning, and augment it with discrete latent variables ( INLINEFORM2 ). Under the invertibility condition, we derive a learning algorithm and give another view of our approach revealed by the objective function. Then, we present the architecture of a neural projector we use in experiments: a volume-preserving invertible neural network proposed by BIBREF16 for independent components estimation.\nLearning with Invertibility\nFor ease of exposition, we explain the learning algorithm in terms of Markov structure without loss of generality. As shown in Eq. ( EQREF17 ), the optimization challenge in our approach comes from the intractability of the marginalized emission factor INLINEFORM0 . If we can marginalize out INLINEFORM1 and compute INLINEFORM2 , then the posterior and marginal likelihood of our Markov-structured model can be computed with the forward-backward algorithm. We can apply Eq. ( EQREF14 ) and obtain : INLINEFORM3\nBy using the change of variable rule to the integration, which allows the integration variable INLINEFORM0 to be replaced by INLINEFORM1 , the marginal emission factor can be computed in closed-form when the invertibility condition is satisfied: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is a conditional Gaussian distribution, INLINEFORM1 is the Jacobian matrix of function INLINEFORM2 at INLINEFORM3 , and INLINEFORM4 represents the absolute value of its determinant. This Jacobian term is nonzero and differentiable if and only if INLINEFORM5 exists.\nEq. ( EQREF19 ) shows that we can directly calculate the marginal emission distribution INLINEFORM0 . Denote the marginal data likelihood of Gaussian HMM as INLINEFORM1 , then the log marginal data likelihood of our model can be directly written as: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 represents the new sequence of embeddings after applying INLINEFORM1 to each INLINEFORM2 . Eq. ( EQREF20 ) shows that the training objective of our model is simply the Gaussian HMM log likelihood with an additional Jacobian regularization term. From this view, our approach can be seen as equivalent to reversely projecting the data through INLINEFORM3 to another manifold INLINEFORM4 that is directly modeled by the Gaussian HMM, with a regularization term. Intuitively, we optimize the reverse projection INLINEFORM5 to modify the INLINEFORM6 space, making it more appropriate for the syntax model. The Jacobian regularization term accounts for the volume expansion or contraction behavior of the projection. Maximizing it can be thought of as preventing information loss. In the extreme case, the Jacobian determinant is equal to zero, which means the projection is non-invertible and thus information is being lost through the projection. Such “information preserving” regularization is crucial during optimization, otherwise the trivial solution of always projecting data to the same single point to maximize likelihood is viable.\nMore generally, for an arbitrary syntax model the data likelihood of our approach is: DISPLAYFORM0\nIf the syntax model itself allows for tractable inference and marginal likelihood computation, the same dynamic program can be used to marginalize out INLINEFORM0 . Therefore, our joint model inherits the tractability of the underlying syntax model.\nInvertible Volume-Preserving Neural Net\nFor the projection we can use an arbitrary invertible function, and given the representational power of neural networks they seem a natural choice. However, calculating the inverse and Jacobian of an arbitrary neural network can be difficult, as it requires that all component functions be invertible and also requires storage of large Jacobian matrices, which is memory intensive. To address this issue, several recent papers propose specially designed invertible networks that are easily trainable yet still powerful BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 , BIBREF19 . Inspired by these works, we use the invertible transformation proposed by BIBREF16 , which consists of a series of “coupling layers”. This architecture is specially designed to guarantee a unit Jacobian determinant (and thus the invertibility property).\nFrom Eq. ( EQREF22 ) we know that only INLINEFORM0 is required for accomplishing learning and inference; we never need to explicitly construct INLINEFORM1 . Thus, we directly define the architecture of INLINEFORM2 . As shown in Figure FIGREF24 , the nonlinear transformation from the observed embedding INLINEFORM3 to INLINEFORM4 represents the first coupling layer. The input in this layer is partitioned into left and right halves of dimensions, INLINEFORM5 and INLINEFORM6 , respectively. A single coupling layer is defined as: DISPLAYFORM0\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the coupling function and can be any nonlinear form. This transformation satisfies INLINEFORM1 , and BIBREF16 show that its Jacobian matrix is triangular with all ones on the main diagonal. Thus the Jacobian determinant is always equal to one (i.e. volume-preserving) and the invertibility condition is naturally satisfied.\nTo be sufficiently expressive, we compose multiple coupling layers as suggested in BIBREF16 . Specifically, we exchange the role of left and right half vectors at each layer as shown in Figure FIGREF24 . For instance, from INLINEFORM0 to INLINEFORM1 the left subset INLINEFORM2 is unchanged, while from INLINEFORM3 to INLINEFORM4 the right subset INLINEFORM5 remains the same. Also note that composing multiple coupling layers does not change the volume-preserving and invertibility properties. Such a sequence of invertible transformations from the data space INLINEFORM6 to INLINEFORM7 is also called normalizing flow BIBREF20 .\nExperiments\nIn this section, we first describe our datasets and experimental setup. We then instantiate our approach with Markov and DMV-structured syntax models, and report results on POS tagging and dependency grammar induction respectively. Lastly, we analyze the learned latent embeddings.\nData\nFor both POS tagging and dependency parsing, we run experiments on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank. To create the observed data embeddings, we train skip-gram word embeddings BIBREF7 that are found to capture syntactic properties well when trained with small context window BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 . Following BIBREF9 , the dimensionality INLINEFORM0 is set to 100, and the training context window size is set to 1 to encode more syntactic information. The skip-gram embeddings are trained on the one billion word language modeling benchmark dataset BIBREF21 in addition to the WSJ corpus.\nGeneral Experimental Setup\nFor the neural projector, we employ rectified networks as coupling function INLINEFORM0 following BIBREF16 . We use a rectified network with an input layer, one hidden layer, and linear output units, the number of hidden units is set to the same as the number of input units. The number of coupling layers are varied as 4, 8, 16 for both tasks. We optimize marginal data likelihood directly using Adam BIBREF22 . For both tasks in the fully unsupervised setting, we do not tune the hyper-parameters using supervised data.\nUnsupervised POS tagging\nFor unsupervised POS tagging, we use a Markov-structured syntax model in our approach, which is a popular structure for unsupervised tagging tasks BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 .\nFollowing existing literature, we train and test on the entire WSJ corpus (49208 sentences, 1M tokens). We use 45 tag clusters, the number of POS tags that appear in WSJ corpus. We train the discrete HMM and the Gaussian HMM BIBREF9 as baselines. For the Gaussian HMM, mean vectors of Gaussian emissions are initialized with the empirical mean of all word vectors with an additive noise. We assume diagonal covariance matrix for INLINEFORM0 and initialize it with the empirical variance of the word vectors. Following BIBREF9 , the covariance matrix is fixed during training. The multinomial probabilities are initialized as INLINEFORM1 , where INLINEFORM2 . For our approach, we initialize the syntax model and Gaussian parameters with the pre-trained Gaussian HMM. The weights of layers in the rectified network are initialized from a uniform distribution with mean zero and a standard deviation of INLINEFORM3 , where INLINEFORM4 is the input dimension. We evaluate the performance of POS tagging with both Many-to-One (M-1) accuracy BIBREF23 and V-Measure (VM) BIBREF24 . Given a model we found that the tagging performance is well-correlated with the training data likelihood, thus we use training data likelihood as a unsupervised criterion to select the trained model over 10 random restarts after training 50 epochs. We repeat this process 5 times and report the mean and standard deviation of performance.\nWe compare our approach with basic HMM, Gaussian HMM, and several state-of-the-art systems, including sophisticated HMM variants and clustering techniques with hand-engineered features. The results are presented in Table TABREF32 . Through the introduced latent embeddings and additional neural projection, our approach improves over the Gaussian HMM by 5.4 points in M-1 and 5.6 points in VM. Neural HMM (NHMM) BIBREF10 is a baseline that also learns word representation jointly. Both their basic model and extended Conv version does not outperform the Gaussian HMM. Their best model incorporates another LSTM to model long distance dependency and breaks the Markov assumption, yet our approach still achieves substantial improvement over it without considering more context information. Moreover, our method outperforms the best published result that benefits from hand-engineered features BIBREF27 by 2.0 points on VM.\nWe found that most tagging errors happen in noun subcategories. Therefore, we do the one-to-one mapping between gold POS tags and induced clusters and plot the normalized confusion matrix of noun subcategories in Figure FIGREF35 . The Gaussian HMM fails to identify “NN” and “NNS” correctly for most cases, and it often recognizes “NNPS” as “NNP”. In contrast, our approach corrects these errors well.\nUnsupervised Dependency Parsing without gold POS tags\nFor the task of unsupervised dependency parse induction, we employ the Dependency Model with Valence (DMV) BIBREF2 as the syntax model in our approach. DMV is a generative model that defines a probability distribution over dependency parse trees and syntactic categories, generating tokens and dependencies in a head-outward fashion. While, traditionally, DMV is trained using gold POS tags as observed syntactic categories, in our approach, we treat each tag as a latent variable, as described in sec:general-neural.\nMost existing approaches to this task are not fully unsupervised since they rely on gold POS tags following the original experimental setup for DMV. This is partially because automatically parsing from words is difficult even when using unsupervised syntactic categories BIBREF29 . However, inducing dependencies from words alone represents a more realistic experimental condition since gold POS tags are often unavailable in practice. Previous work that has trained from words alone often requires additional linguistic constraints (like sentence internal boundaries) BIBREF29 , BIBREF30 , BIBREF31 , BIBREF32 , acoustic cues BIBREF33 , additional training data BIBREF4 , or annotated data from related languages BIBREF34 . Our approach is naturally designed to train on word embeddings directly, thus we attempt to induce dependencies without using gold POS tags or other extra linguistic information.\nLike previous work we use sections 02-21 of WSJ corpus as training data and evaluate on section 23, we remove punctuations and train the models on sentences of length INLINEFORM0 , “head-percolation” rules BIBREF39 are applied to obtain gold dependencies for evaluation. We train basic DMV, extended DMV (E-DMV) BIBREF35 and Gaussian DMV (which treats POS tag as unknown latent variables and generates observed word embeddings directly conditioned on them following Gaussian distribution) as baselines. Basic DMV and E-DMV are trained with Viterbi EM BIBREF40 on unsupervised POS tags induced from our Markov-structured model described in sec:pos. Multinomial parameters of the syntax model in both Gaussian DMV and our model are initialized with the pre-trained DMV baseline. Other parameters are initialized in the same way as in the POS tagging experiment. The directed dependency accuracy (DDA) is used for evaluation and we report accuracy on sentences of length INLINEFORM1 and all lengths. We train the parser until training data likelihood converges, and report the mean and standard deviation over 20 random restarts.\nOur model directly observes word embeddings and does not require gold POS tags during training. Thus, results from related work trained on gold tags are not directly comparable. However, to measure how these systems might perform without gold tags, we run three recent state-of-the-art systems in our experimental setting: UR-A E-DMV BIBREF36 , Neural E-DMV BIBREF11 , and CRF Autoencoder (CRFAE) BIBREF37 . We use unsupervised POS tags (induced from our Markov-structured model) in place of gold tags. We also train basic DMV on gold tags and include several state-of-the-art results on gold tags as reference points.\nAs shown in Table TABREF39 , our approach is able to improve over the Gaussian DMV by 4.8 points on length INLINEFORM0 and 4.8 points on all lengths, which suggests the additional latent embedding layer and neural projector are helpful. The proposed approach yields, to the best of our knowledge, state-of-the-art performance without gold POS annotation and without sentence-internal boundary information. DMV, UR-A E-DMV, Neural E-DMV, and CRFAE suffer a large decrease in performance when trained on unsupervised tags – an effect also seen in previous work BIBREF29 , BIBREF34 . Since our approach induces latent POS tags jointly with dependency trees, it may be able to learn POS clusters that are more amenable to grammar induction than the unsupervised tags. We observe that CRFAE underperforms its gold-tag counterpart substantially. This may largely be a result of the model's reliance on prior linguistic rules that become unavailable when gold POS tag types are unknown. Many extensions to DMV can be considered orthogonal to our approach – they essentially focus on improving the syntax model. It is possible that incorporating these more sophisticated syntax models into our approach may lead to further improvements.\nSensitivity Analysis\nIn the above experiments we initialize the structured syntax components with the pre-trained Gaussian or discrete baseline, which is shown as a useful technique to help train our deep models. We further study the results with fully random initialization. In the POS tagging experiment, we report the results in Table TABREF48 . While the performance with 4 layers is comparable to the pre-trained Gaussian initialization, deeper projections (8 or 16 layers) result in a dramatic drop in performance. This suggests that the structured syntax model with very deep projections is difficult to train from scratch, and a simpler projection might be a good compromise in the random initialization setting.\nDifferent from the Markov prior in POS tagging experiments, our parsing model seems to be quite sensitive to the initialization. For example, directed accuracy of our approach on sentences of length INLINEFORM0 is below 40.0 with random initialization. This is consistent with previous work that has noted the importance of careful initialization for DMV-based models such as the commonly used harmonic initializer BIBREF2 . However, it is not straightforward to apply the harmonic initializer for DMV directly in our model without using some kind of pre-training since we do not observe gold POS.\nWe investigate the effect of the choice of pre-trained embedding on performance while using our approach. To this end, we additionally include results using fastText embeddings BIBREF41 – which, in contrast with skip-gram embeddings, include character-level information. We set the context windows size to 1 and the dimension size to 100 as in the skip-gram training, while keeping other parameters set to their defaults. These results are summarized in Table TABREF50 and Table TABREF51 . While fastText embeddings lead to reduced performance with our model, our approach still yields an improvement over the Gaussian baseline with the new observed embeddings space.\nQualitative Analysis of Embeddings\nWe perform qualitative analysis to understand how the latent embeddings help induce syntactic structures. First we filter out low-frequency words and punctuations in WSJ, and visualize the rest words (10k) with t-SNE BIBREF42 under different embeddings. We assign each word with its most likely gold POS tags in WSJ and color them according to the gold POS tags.\nFor our Markov-structured model, we have displayed the embedding space in Figure SECREF5 , where the gold POS clusters are well-formed. Further, we present five example target words and their five nearest neighbors in terms of cosine similarity. As shown in Table TABREF53 , the skip-gram embedding captures both semantic and syntactic aspects to some degree, yet our embeddings are able to focus especially on the syntactic aspects of words, in an unsupervised fashion without using any extra morphological information.\nIn Figure FIGREF54 we depict the learned latent embeddings with the DMV-structured syntax model. Unlike the Markov structure, the DMV structure maps a large subset of singular and plural nouns to the same overlapping region. However, two clusters of singular and plural nouns are actually separated. We inspect the two clusters and the overlapping region in Figure FIGREF54 , it turns out that the nouns in the separated clusters are words that can appear as subjects and, therefore, for which verb agreement is important to model. In contrast, the nouns in the overlapping region are typically objects. This demonstrates that the latent embeddings are focusing on aspects of language that are specifically important for modeling dependency without ever having seen examples of dependency parses. Some previous work has deliberately created embeddings to capture different notions of similarity BIBREF43 , BIBREF44 , while they use extra morphology or dependency annotations to guide the embedding learning, our approach provides a potential alternative to create new embeddings that are guided by structured syntax model, only using unlabeled text corpora.\nRelated Work\nOur approach is related to flow-based generative models, which are first described in NICE BIBREF16 and have recently received more attention BIBREF17 , BIBREF19 , BIBREF18 . This relevant work mostly adopts simple (e.g. Gaussian) and fixed priors and does not attempt to learn interpretable latent structures. Another related generative model class is variational auto-encoders (VAEs) BIBREF45 that optimize a lower bound on the marginal data likelihood, and can be extended to learn latent structures BIBREF46 , BIBREF47 . Against the flow-based models, VAEs remove the invertibility constraint but sacrifice the merits of exact inference and exact log likelihood computation, which potentially results in optimization challenges BIBREF48 . Our approach can also be viewed in connection with generative adversarial networks (GANs) BIBREF49 that is a likelihood-free framework to learn implicit generative models. However, it is non-trivial for a gradient-based method like GANs to propagate gradients through discrete structures.\nConclusion\nIn this work, we define a novel generative approach to leverage continuous word representations for unsupervised learning of syntactic structure. Experiments on both POS induction and unsupervised dependency parsing tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Future work might explore more sophisticated invertible projections, or recurrent projections that jointly transform the entire input sequence.\n\n Answer the question based on the above article as concisely as you can, using a single phrase or sentence if possible.

It used to be made with Bourgogne Aligoté, a lesser white wine of Burgundy.  Now, various white wines are used throughout France, according to the region and the whim of the barkeeper. Many prefer a white Chardonnay-based Burgundy, such as Chablis.\n\nIt used to be called blanc-cassis, but it is now named after Félix Kir (1876–1968), mayor of Dijon in Burgundy. Kir was a pioneer of the twinning movement in the aftermath of the Second World War, and popularized the drink by offering it at receptions to visiting delegations.  Besides treating his international guests well, he was also promoting two economic products of the region.  Kir allowed one of Dijon's producers of crème de cassis to use his name, then extended the right to their competitors as well.  According to Rolland (2004),  the reinvention of blanc-cassis (post 1945) was necessitated by the German Army's confiscation of all the local red Burgundy during the war. Faced with an excess of white wine, Kir renovated a drink that used to be made primarily with the red.\n\nAnother explanation that has been offered is that Mayor Kir revived it during a year in which the ordinary white wine of the region was inferior and the creme de cassis helped to disguise the fact.\n\nFollowing the commercial development of crème de cassis in 1841, the cocktail became a popular regional café drink, but has since become inextricably linked internationally with the name of Mayor Kir.  When ordering a kir, waiters in France sometimes ask whether the customer wants it made with crème de cassis (blackcurrant), de mûre (blackberry) or de pêche (peach).\n\nThe International Bartenders Association gives a recipe using 1/10 crème de cassis, but French sources typically specify more; 19th-century recipes for blanc-cassis recommended 1/3 crème de cassis, which modern tastes find cloyingly sweet, and modern sources typically about 1/5.  Replacing the crème de cassis with blackcurrant syrup is discouraged. \n\nVariations\n\nBesides the basic Kir, a number of variations exist:\n\n* Cidre Royal - made with cider instead of wine, with a measure of calvados added\n* Communard/Cardinal - made with red wine instead of white\n* Hibiscus Royal - made with sparkling wine, peach liqueur, raspberry liqueur, and an edible hibiscus flower\n* Kir Berrichon - from the Berry region of France.

It was produced by London Weekend Television from 1969 to 1970.\n\nWriters for the Doctor in the House episodes were Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Barry Cryer, Graeme Garden, Bill Oddie and Bernard McKenna.\nThe series was directed by David Askey and Maurice Murphy among others and the producer was Humphrey Barclay.

Its name is often said to be a corruption of Bordeaux, as a result of settlement in the area by French immigrants associated with Mary, Queen of Scots (cf Little France nearby), but this is by no means certain. \n\nModern Burdiehouse is an area with high levels of poverty among residents.\n\nThe Burdiehouse Burn (known elsewhere as the Lothian Burn, Niddrie Burn and Brunstane Burn) flows through the area.\n\nIt was also called the quaint village of Burdiehouse on Location Location Location\nQuestion:\n\"Which city has \"\"areas\"\" called Burdiehouse, Clermiston, Corstorphine, Dumbiedykes, The Grange, Haymarket, Hermiston, Holyrood, Inverleith, Jock's Lodge, Leith, Meadowbank, Murrayfield, Oxgangs, Pilrig, Portobello, Riccarton, Shandon and Tynecastle?\"\nAnswer:\nDun Eideann\nPassage:\nTime Person of the Year\nPerson of the Year (called Man of the Year until 1999 ) is an annual issue of the United States news magazine, Time, that features and profiles a person, a group, an idea, or an object that \"for better or for worse...has done the most to influence the events of the year\". \n\nBackground\n\nThe tradition of selecting a \"Man of the Year\" began in 1927, with Time editors contemplating the news makers of the year. The idea was also an attempt to remedy the editorial embarrassment earlier that year of not having aviator Charles Lindbergh on its cover following his historic trans-Atlantic flight. By the end of the year, it was decided that a cover story featuring Lindbergh as the Man of the Year would serve both purposes. \n\nSince then, individual people, classes of people, the computer (\"Machine of the Year\" in 1982), and \"Endangered Earth\" (\"Planet of the Year\" in 1988) have all been selected for the special year-end issue. Despite the magazine's frequent statements to the contrary, the designation is often regarded as an honor, and spoken of as an award or prize, simply based on many previous selections of admirable people.  However, Time magazine points out that controversial figures such as Adolf Hitler (1938), Joseph Stalin (1939 and 1942), Nikita Khrushchev (1957) and Ayatollah Khomeini (1979) have also been granted the title for their impacts. \n\nIn 1999, the title was changed to Person of the Year.  Women who have been selected for recognition after the renaming include \"The Whistleblowers\" (Cynthia Cooper, Coleen Rowley and Sherron Watkins in 2002), Melinda Gates (jointly with Bill Gates and Bono, in 2005), and Angela Merkel in 2015. Prior to 1999, four women were granted the title as individuals, as \"Woman of the Year\"—Wallis Simpson (1936), Soong Mei-ling (1937), Queen Elizabeth II (1952) and Corazon Aquino (1986). \"American Women\" were recognized as a group in 1975. Other classes of people recognized comprise both men and women, such as \"Hungarian Freedom Fighters\" (1956), \"U.S. Scientists\" (1960), \"The Inheritors\" (1966), \"The Middle Americans\" (1969), \"The American Soldier\" (2003), \"You\" (2006), \"The Protester\" (2011) represented on the cover by a woman, and \"Ebola fighters\" (2014).\n\nSince the list began, every serving President of the United States has been a Person of the Year at least once with the exceptions of Calvin Coolidge, in office at time of the first issue, Herbert Hoover, the next U.S. president, and Gerald Ford. Most were named Person of the Year either the year they were elected or while they were in office; the only one to be given the title before being elected is Dwight D. Eisenhower, in 1944 as Supreme Commander of the Allied Invasion Force, eight years before his election. He subsequently received the title again in 1959, while in office. Franklin D. Roosevelt is the only person to have received the title three times, first as President-elect (1932) and later as the incumbent President (1934 and 1941).\n\nThe last issue of 1989 named Mikhail Gorbachev as \"Man of the Decade\". The December 31, 1999 issue of Time named Albert Einstein the \"Person of the Century\". Franklin D. Roosevelt and Mahatma Gandhi were chosen as runners-up. \n\nAs a result of the public backlash it received from the United States for naming the Khomeini as Man of the Year in 1979, Time has shied away from using figures who are controversial in the United States due to commercial reasons.  Times Person of the Year 2001, immediately following the September 11, 2001 attacks, was New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani, although the stated rules of selection, the individual or group of individuals who have had the biggest effect on the year's news, made Osama bin Laden a more likely choice. The issue that declared Giuliani the Person of the Year included an article that mentioned Time's earlier decision to select the Ayatollah Khomeini and the 1999 rejection of Hitler as \"Person of the Century\". The article seemed to imply that Osama bin Laden was a stronger candidate than Giuliani, as Adolf Hitler was a stronger candidate than Albert Einstein. The selections were ultimately based on what the magazine describes as who they believed had a stronger influence on history and who represented either the year or the century the most. According to Time, Rudolph Giuliani was selected for symbolizing the American response to the September 11th attacks, and Albert Einstein selected for representing a century of scientific exploration and wonder.\n\nAnother controversial choice was the 2006 selection of \"You\", representing most if not all people for advancing the information age by using the Internet (via e.g. blogs, YouTube, MySpace and Wikipedia). \n\nTime magazine also holds online poll for the readers to vote for who they believe to be the Person of the Year. While many mistakenly believe the winner of the poll to be the Person of the Year, the title, as mentioned above, is decided by the editors of Time. In the first online poll held in 1998, wrestler and activist Mick Foley won with over 50% of votes.   Foley was removed from the poll, and the title was given to Clinton and Starr, which led to the outrage from the fans of Foley who mistakenly believed the winner of the poll would be the winner of the title. In 2006, the poll winner by a wide margin was Hugo Chávez, with 35% of the votes. The president of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad came in second. Time again ignored those results, not mentioning them in the announcement of the Person of the Year.  Time continues to annually run an online poll for the \"People's Choice\", but stresses the decision on who the magazine recognizes is made independently of this poll by the magazine's editors. \n\nPersons of the Year\nQuestion:\nWhom did Time Magazine tab as their Person of the Year for 2011?\nAnswer:\nRemonstratory\nPassage:\nSki resort\nA ski resort is a resort developed for skiing, snowboarding, and other winter sports. In Europe, most ski resorts are towns or villages in or adjacent to a ski area – a mountainous area with pistes, ski trails and a ski lift system. In North America, it is more common for ski areas to exist well away from towns, so ski resorts usually are destination resorts, often purpose-built and self-contained, where skiing is the main activity.\n\nTypes\n\nThe ski industry has identified advancing generations   of ski resorts:\n;First generation: Developed around a well-established summer resort or village (e.g. Davos, St. Moritz, Kitzbühel, Chamonix Haute-Savoie, Megève, Val Gardena).\n;Second generation: Created from a non-tourist village or pasture (e.g. St. Anton, Lech, Courchevel Savoie, L'Alpe d'Huez, Aspen, Breckenridge).\n;Third generation or integrated: Designed from scratch on virgin territory to be a purpose-built ski resort, all the amenities and services nearby (e.g. Sestrière, Flaine, La Plagne, Isola 2000).\n;Fourth generation or village resorts: Created from virgin territory or around an existing village, but more concerned with traditional uses (e.g. resorts built since 1975 like Shahdag Mountain Resort, Azerbaijan).\n\nThe term ski station is also used, particularly in Europe, for a skiing facility which is not located in or near a town or village.\nA ski resort which is also open for summer activities is often referred to as a mountain resort.\n\nFacilities and amenities\n\nSki areas have marked paths for skiing known as runs, trails or pistes. Ski areas typically have one or more chairlifts for moving skiers rapidly to the top of hills, and to interconnect the various trails. Rope tows can also be used on short slopes (usually beginner hills or bunny slopes). Larger ski areas may use gondolas or aerial trams for transportation across longer distances within the ski area.\n\nSki areas usually have at least a basic first aid facility, and some kind of ski patrol service to ensure that injured skiers are rescued.  The ski patrol is usually responsible for rule enforcement, marking hazards, closing individual runs (if a sufficient level of hazard exists), and removing (dismissing) dangerous participants from the area.\n\nSome ski resorts offer lodging options on the slopes themselves, with ski-in and ski-out access allowing guests to ski right up to the door.  Ski resorts often have other activities, such as snowmobiling, sledding, horse-drawn sleds, dog-sledding, ice-skating, indoor or outdoor swimming, and hot tubbing, game rooms, and local forms of entertainment, such as clubs, cinema, theaters and cabarets. Après-ski () is a term for entertainment, nightlife or social events that occur specifically at ski resorts.   These add to the enjoyment of resort-goers and provide something to do besides skiing and snowboarding. The culture originated in the Alps, where it is most popular and where skiers often stop at bars on their last run of the day while still wearing all their ski gear.  People that browse ski resort & hotel websites will commonly seek mention of the quality of après-ski in the area, and such information is often found. It is therefore seen as an important factor for skiers to consider before booking a holiday. The concept is similar to the nineteenth hole in golf.\n\nThough the word ‘ski’ is a derivation of the Old Norse ‘skíð’ via Norwegian, the choice of French is likely attributed to the early popularity of such activities in the French Alps, with which it was then linked. \n\nEnvironmental impacts of ski resorts \n\nThe process of resort development have progressed since the birth of the skiing industry. As the economic role of the skiing industry grew, the environmental impact of resort development has also caused environmental burdens on the natural ecosystem including mountain water levels of lakes, streams, and wildlife.  Amenities and infrastructure such as concrete buildings, ski-lifts, gondolas, access roads, parking lots, and railways have contributed to the urbanization of mountainous zones.\n\nPrimary (direct) impact of resort development \n\nIn recent years, the use of snow canons have increased due to the fall in the volume of snow. In order to obtain good quality snow, dust or bacteria is mixed with the water in the process of snow making to form better snowflakes. Not only that the manufacture of artificial snow is costly and uses large amounts of water, but sometimes the creation of artificial lakes are necessary for the snow-making process. Snow canons redistributes a large amount of water unnaturally over the land and freezes the ground vegetation late into spring, preventing growth and leaving pistes bare. With enough amount of excess water, and the likelihood of landslides and avalanches would be drastically higher.\n\nSecondary (indirect) impact of resort development \n\nThe required space for hotels, flats and secondary residences has increased the amount of space occupied by roads and buildings. While a large amount of people requires special water, sewage and electricity systems, a great deal of construction work is needed. Access roads and the treatment of salt are responsible for high amounts of erosion at ski resorts. In some cases natural lakes must be tapped or reservoirs built to cater for the population demand.  The urbanization of mountainous areas have increased the space of impervious surface, and prevents the natural flow of water into the ground. Resulting in a disturbed water table and potential cause of erosion in undesired places. Lastly, when building ski lifts, its line of operation must be shaped and drained, and large concrete blocks must be set down for pylons. If the pylons are not carefully placed, it could cause damage to surface vegetation.\n\nGallery\n\nVista de Valle Nevado.jpg|Valle Nevado, Chile\nMale Ciche.jpg|Małe Ciche, Poland\nPerisher valley snow fields.jpg |Perisher Ski Resort, Australia\nSierra Nevada España (Spain) 10.JPG|Sierra Nevada Ski Station, Spain\nPistenplan Arosa Lenzerheide.jpg|Arosa Lenzerheide Ski Resort, Switzerland\nShahdag01.jpg|Shahdag Mountain Resort, Azerbaijan\nQuestion:\nAt which European winter sports resort is the Cresta Run?\nAnswer:\nSt. Moritz (Graubünden)\n\n\nPassage:\nParker's Piece\nParker's Piece is a 25 acre flat and roughly square green common located near the centre of Cambridge, England and is now regarded as the birthplace of the rules of Association Football.  The two main walking and cycling paths across it run diagonally, and the single lamp-post at the junction is colloquially known as Reality Checkpoint. The area is bounded by Park Terrace, Parkside, Gonville Place, and Regent Terrace. The Cambridge University Football Club Laws were first used on Parker's Piece and adopted by the Football Association in 1863. \"They embrace the true principles of the game, with the greatest simplicity\" (E. C. Morley, F.A. Hon. Sec. 1863). 'The Cambridge Rules appear to be the most desirable for the Association to adopt' (C. W. Alcock 1863, FA committee member and founder of the FA Cup). A statue was due to be erected in October 2013 to celebrate the 150th anniversary on the Football Association and their adoption of the Cambridge Rules, but has been delayed. \n\nThe grass is well manicured and it is known today chiefly as a spot for picnics and games of football and cricket, and serves as the games field for nearby Parkside Community College.  Fairs tend to be held on the rougher ground of Midsummer Common.\n\nIn 1838, a feast for 15,000 guests was held on Parker's Piece to celebrate the coronation of Queen Victoria.\n\nHistory\n\nBefore 1613, the site of Parker's Piece was owned by Trinity College. In that year, the college exchanged the land — at that time located well outside the town — with the town of Cambridge for the majority of Garret Hostel Green, an island on the River Cam, and the site of the current Wren Library, Trinity College. It was subsequently named after a college cook, Edward Parker, who obtained the rights to farm on it.\n\nAs a cricket ground, Parker's Piece was used for first-class matches from 1817 to 1864. \n\nIn the 19th century, it was one of the principal sports grounds used by students at the University of Cambridge and the site of numerous Varsity Matches against Oxford.\n\nParker's Piece and football\n\nIn the 19th century, football was also commonly played on this ground, as is described in the following quotation from George Corrie, Master of Jesus College (1838):  \"In walking with Willis we passed by Parker's Piece and there saw some forty Gownsmen playing at football. The novelty and liveliness of the scene were amusing!\" \n\nRules of football\n\nParker's Piece has a special place in the history of modern football games, as it was here that the Cambridge Rules of 1848 were first put into practice.  They were very influential in the creation of the modern rules of Association Football, drawn up in London by The Football Association in 1863.  A plaque has been mounted at Parker's Piece bearing the following inscription: \n\nModern passing tactics\n\nThe move by the Cambridge University AFC away from Parker's Piece in 1882 coincided with the side's significant role in the development of the modern passing, combination game. In a detailed investigation into the evolution of football tactics based upon contemporary accounts, Adrian Harvey refers to the teams responsible for the early development of the passing game (including Sheffield, The Royal Engineers   and Queens Park) but comes to the following conclusion about the finished, modern team product:  \"Curiously, the side that was generally credited with transforming the tactics of association football and almost single-handedly inventing the modern game was not a professional team but the Cambridge University XI of 1882.  Contemporaries described Cambridge as being the first \"combination\" team in which each player was allotted an area of the field and played as part of a team in a game that was based upon passing\".   In a discussion by CW Alcock on the history of a \"definite scheme of attack\" and  \"elaborate combination\" in football playing style, he states in 1891:  \"The perfection of the system which is in vogue at the present time however is in a very great measure the creation of the last few years.  The Cambridge University eleven of 1882 were the first to illustrate the full possibilities of a systematic combination giving full scope to the defence as well as the attack\" \n\nProposed sculpture\n\nIn May 2013, the Cambridge City Council proposed that a 2 m statue by artist Gordon Young, in the form of a Subbuteo referee on top of a circular plinth engraved with Cambridge Rules be installed on Parker's Piece to mark the 150th anniversary of the publication of the 1863 Football Association rules and Parker's Piece's association with it.  The proposal was rejected in June 2013 before public consultation due to negative feedback and concerns with Hasbro, which markets Subbuteo, and the possibility of significantly exceeding its original £88,000 budget. \n\nTrial lighting\n\nFor a four-week trial beginning January 2013, lighting bollards were temporarily installed along the northwest path, between Reality Checkpoint and Melbourne Place, as residents and students had claimed that Parker's Piece was unsafe after dark. Several attacks had previously occurred in the park.  \n\nParkside\n\nParkside is the street on the north-east side of the park. Since 2006  it has been the terminus for long distance coach services (such as the Stagecoach bus route X5 to Oxford), visitor coaches and a stopping point for local bus services. The street is also home to the city's police station, as well as giving access to Parkside Community College.\n\nGallery\n\nImage:ISH WC Cambridge15.jpg|Looking towards Our Lady and the English Martyrs Church\nImage:Cambridge_Parkers_Piece_Catholic_Church.jpg|The Catholic church of Our Lady and the English Martyrs viewed from Parker's Piece.\nImage:Cambridge_Race_For_Life_2011_Parkers_Piece.jpg|Race for Life 2011 at Parker's Piece.

{"article": "Answer the question based on the given passage. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words. The following are some examples.\n\nPassage:\nNoble rot\nNoble rot (; ; ; ) is the beneficial form of a grey fungus, Botrytis cinerea, affecting wine grapes. Infestation by Botrytis requires moist conditions. If the weather stays wet, the damaging form, \"grey rot,\" can destroy crops of grapes. Grapes typically become infected with Botrytis when they are ripe. If they are then exposed to drier conditions and become partially raisined this form of infection brought about by the partial drying process is known as noble rot. Grapes when picked at a certain point during infestation can produce particularly fine and concentrated sweet wine. Some of the finest Botrytized wines are picked berry by berry in successive tries (French for \"selections\").\n\nOrigins\n\nAccording to Hungarian legend the first aszú (a wine using botrytised grapes) was made by Laczkó Máté Szepsi in 1630. However, mention of wine made from botrytised grapes had already appeared in the Nomenklatura of Fabricius Balázs Sziksai, which was completed in 1576. A recently discovered inventory of aszú predates this reference by five years. When vineyard classification began in 1730 in the Tokaj region, one of the gradings given to the various terroirs centered on their potential to develop Botrytis cinerea.\n\nA popular myth is that the practice originated independently in Germany in 1775, where the Riesling producers at Schloss Johannisberg (Geisenheim, in the Rheingau region) traditionally awaited the say-so of the estate owner, Heinrich von Bibra, Bishop of Fulda, before cutting their grapes. In this year (so the legend goes), the abbey messenger was robbed en route to delivering the order to harvest and the cutting was delayed for three weeks, time enough for the Botrytis to take hold. The grapes were presumed worthless and given to local peasants,  who produced a surprisingly good, sweet wine which subsequently became known as Spätlese, or late harvest wine. In the following few years, several different classes of increasing must weight were introduced, and the original Spätlese was further elaborated, first into Auslese in 1787  and later Eiswein in 1858 (although Eiswein is usually made from grapes not affected by Botrytis). \n\nViticulture and uses\n\nInternationally renowned botrytised wines include the aszú of Tokaj-Hegyalja in Hungary and Slovakia (commonly called Tokaji, Tokajské or Tokay), Sauternes from France - where the process is known as pourriture or pourriture noble, and Beerenauslese or Trockenbeerenauslese wines from Germany and Austria. Other wines of this type include the Romanian Grasă de Cotnari, French Coteaux du Layon, French Monbazillac, Austrian Ausbruch and South African Noble Late Harvest (NLH). Depending on conditions the grapes may be only minimally botrytized. Botrytis has also been imported for use by winemakers in California and Australia. In some cases inoculation occurs when spores are sprayed over the grapes, while some vineyards depend on natural inoculation from spores present in the environment.\nQuestion:\nNoble Rot is a fungus affecting which fruit?\nAnswer:\nWhite Grape\nPassage:\nRide of the Valkyries\nThe \"Ride of the Valkyries\" () is the popular term for the beginning of act 3 of Die Walküre, the second of the four operas by Richard Wagner that constitute Der Ring des Nibelungen.\n\nAs a separate piece, the \"Ride\" is often heard in a purely instrumental version, which may be as short as three minutes. Together with the \"Bridal Chorus\" from Lohengrin, the \"Ride of the Valkyries\" is one of Wagner's best-known pieces.\n\nContext \n\nIn the Walküre opera, the \"Ride\", which takes around eight minutes, begins in the prelude to the third act, building up successive layers of accompaniment until the curtain rises to reveal a mountain peak where four of the eight Valkyrie sisters of Brünnhilde have gathered in preparation for the transportation of fallen heroes to Valhalla. As they are joined by the other four, the familiar tune is carried by the orchestra, while, above it, the Valkyries greet each other and sing their battle-cry. Apart from the song of the Rhinemaidens in Das Rheingold, it is the only ensemble piece in the first three operas of Wagner's Ring cycle.\n\nPerformance history \n\nThe complete opera Die Walküre was first performed on 26 June 1870 in the National Theatre Munich against the composer's intent. By January of the next year, Wagner was receiving requests for the \"Ride\" to be performed separately, but wrote that such a performance should be considered \"an utter indiscretion\" and forbade \"any such thing\".  However, the piece was still printed and sold in Leipzig, and Wagner subsequently wrote a complaint to the publisher Schott.  In the period up to the first performance of the complete Ring cycle, Wagner continued to receive requests for separate performances, his second wife Cosima noting \"Unsavoury letters arrive for R. – requests for the Ride of the Valkyries and I don't know what else.\"  Once the Ring had been given in Bayreuth in 1876, Wagner lifted the embargo. He himself conducted it in London on 12 May 1877, repeating it as an encore. \n\nOutside opera \n\nIn film \n\nUses in film include the original score for The Birth of a Nation (1915),  and What's Opera, Doc? (1957). \n\nThe \"Ride\" is also associated with Apocalypse Now (1979),  where the 1/9 Air Cavalry regiment plays the piece of music on helicopter-mounted loudspeakers during their assault on a Vietnamese village as psychological warfare and to motivate their own troops. \n\nIn military \n\nThe \"Ride\" is the regimental quick march of the British Parachute Regiment. \n\nIn music \n\nWithin the concert repertoire, the \"Ride of the Valkyries\" remains a popular encore, especially when other Wagnerian extracts feature in the scheduled program. For example, at the BBC Proms it was performed as such by Klaus Tennstedt and the London Philharmonic Orchestra on 6 August 1992  and also by Valery Gergiev with the Kirov Orchestra on 28 August 2001. \n\nDiscography \n\nApart from where the \"Ride\" is included in the recordings of the Walküre opera, it is a very popular piece, included in various popular classics anthologies. For instance in Deutsche Grammophon's 1991 Classicmania two CD album (von Karajan version), and in Brilliant Classics' 2011 Best Film Classics CD box, there included in the fifth CD, Opera at the Movies, with a reference to Apocalypse Now on the sleeve.\nQuestion:\n\"Who composed \"\"Ride of the Valkyries\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nWagner's\nPassage:\n35th Anniversary - Thirty-Fifth Wedding Anniversary\n35th Anniversary - Thirty-Fifth Wedding Anniversary\nMost Popular Song 35 Years Ago: \"PHYSICAL\" - Olivia Newton John\nPrice of Gasoline when you were married: $1.22 / gallon\nTRADITIONAL GIFT:  According to ancient  history, coral is said to have a magical power to prevent sterility. Coral is  mostly comprised of calcium carbonate. Coral has an opaque quality to it and  can be found in pink, white, orange, red and black. Angel-skin coral is  considered one of the most valuable of all coral. It is found near Japan and  used in most fine coral jewelry. The most valuable coral is called blood coral.  Found near Italy, blood coral is the most expensive coral in the world. Any  coral that contains parts of blood coral is immediately more valuable. Red  coral defends against plague and pestilence. It is thought that uncut coral  worn around the neck will lose its color if that person is in the presence of  another person who is going to die.\nMODERN GIFT:  Jade is another gift associated with the 35th anniversary and is  emerald green in color. The two minerals that mostly comprise jade are jadeite  and nephrite. Jadeite is the more sought after and valuable of the  two. The best jadeite is found in Myanmar in Asia. Jade can also be found in  yellow, pink, purple and black. The most common color is emerald green. In  ancient times it was thought that jade protected the kidney, liver, spleen,  heart, larynx, thymus and thyroid. Jade was associated with increased body  strength and advanced longevity.\nGEMSTONE:  The emerald is known for  its brilliant green shine. This shine comes from a high content of chromium.  Genuine emeralds contain trace amounts of iron, which actually increases the  value of the stone. Some of the best emeralds in the world are found in South  America, particularly Columbia and Brazil. Ancient Egyptians buried emeralds  with mummies. Some of the oldest emeralds in the world were harvested from the  infamous “Cleopatra mines”. Emeralds are known to be very tough gems, but they  are prone to cracks on the surface, which could devalue the gem. For this  reason, before the gems are sold to the public, they are treated with epoxy or  oils to fix or prevent any cracks and improve the transparency.\nWe hope that you have  enjoyed reading this historical information about the 35th wedding anniversary.

She has climbed Mount Fuji in Japan as well as the Matterhorn in the Swiss Alps, among others. By 1972, Tabei was a recognized mountain climber in Japan.\n\nEverest expedition\n\nThe team of JWEE (Japanese Women’s Everest Expedition) consisted of fifteen, mostly working women including teachers, a computer programmer and a juvenile counselor. Two of them, including Tabei, were mothers.  JWEE, headed by Eiko Hisano, was a part of the Ladies Climbing Club, founded in 1969. After successful summit of Annapurna III on May 19, 1970 by Tabei and Hiroko Hirakawa,  LCC decided to attack Mount Everest.\n\nAlthough they obtained last-minute funding from Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper and Nippon Television, all the members still had to pay an amount that was almost equal to Japan’s average salary. To save money, they would use recycled car sheets to sew up water-proof pouches and over-gloves. They purchased goose feather from China and made their own sleeping bags. Students at school collected unused packets of jam for their teachers. \n\nAfter a long training period, they began the expedition early in 1975 when they traveled to Kathmandu. They used the same route Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay took in 1953.\n\nIn early May the women were camping at 6,300 meters when an avalanche struck their camp. The women, including Tabei and the guides, were buried under the snow. Tabei lost consciousness for approximately six minutes until her Sherpa guide dug her out. Twelve days after the avalanche, Tabei became the first female to reach the summit of Mount Everest.\n\nLater activities\n\nOn 28 June 1992 Tabei finished the climb of Puncak Jaya to become the first woman to complete the Seven Summits. \n\nTabei had a goal to climb the highest peak in every country in the world and continues to work on ecological concerns. Tabei is the director of Himalayan Adventure Trust of Japan, an organization working on a global level to preserve mountain environments.\nQuestion:\nIn 1975, Junko Tabei became the first woman to reach the summit of which mountain?\nAnswer:\nMt.
